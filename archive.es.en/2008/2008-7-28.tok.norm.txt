german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .
you ca n't control the situation with fighter jets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 28.07.2008 played by unscrupulous journalist , obama whines a bit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : careful barack , any one of them could be a reporter from a german tabloid for a man who has faced the issues of race , the connotations his middle name conjures up with some voters , and the fact that he smokes , barack obama seems to have shown his vulnerable side while in berlin . the svelte 46-year-old illinois senator comes across as a man who can facedown most political arguments and also trade dukes if need be with anyone threatening him or his family .
but after a spot of ambush journalism while in the german capital , one starts to wonder if , well , maybe he 's a bit of a wuss . after being photographed smiling accommodatingly with a young german woman in a berlin gym , obama was horrified to find out that the " fan " who he thought was getting a personal snap , was in fact a reporter for the bild zeitung tabloid . not only did the newspaper reproduce the young lady 's photo of the pair without the permission of the presumed presidential candidate 's permission but , worse still , she submitted an accompanying article which alluded to obama 's " firm rear end , " " well-trained arms , " and ended with the phrase , " what a man ! " having been first hijacked in the name of popular journalism and then exploited as presidential eye-candy , obama was apparently wounded by the story : " bild reporter in the gym with obama , " published the day after his triumphant speech at berlin 's victory column on july 24 . the senator-reduced-to-mere-sex-object told the new york times columnist maureen dowd in an interview published over the weekend , that he had been conned and " hustled " . while the times article did n't actually mention any whining , there was a hint of the wounded victim about obama 's recollection of the event . media player obama outplayed by bild reporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shy obama seems to shun the limelight when he minders are n't behind the controls " i 'm just realizing what i 've got to become accustomed to , " he tells dowd in the article .
" the fact that i was played like that at the gym . ...
she hustled us . " we walk into the gym .
she 's already on the treadmill .
she looks like just an ordinary german girl .
she smiles and sort of waves , shyly , but does n't go out of her way to say anything .
as i 'm walking out , she says : ' oh , can i have a picture ?
i 'm a big fan . '
reggie -lrb- his assistant -rrb- takes the picture . "
maybe judith bonesky , the " ordinary german girl , " should have been working out in a filthy trench coat and a trilby hat with a " press " card stuck in its band , just so everyone knew she was a media parasite . despite his protestations , no tangible harm seems to have come from the bild article - unless you count the fact obama showed the same need to control the press exhibited by politicians since time the beginning of politicking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .
you ca n't control the situation with fighter jets .
particularly when you strike those very people who you actually want to protect as has happened so often during attacks . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .
republicans are instead trying to brand the trip - which saw obama stop in afghanistan , iraq , israel , kuwait , jordan , germany , france and the uk - a shallow political stunt . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .

these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .
republicans are instead trying to brand the trip - which saw obama stop in afghanistan , iraq , israel , kuwait , jordan , germany , france and the uk - a shallow political stunt . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .

" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .

" rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .

" rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike .

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 . " all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership , " shark said . india rebuffs us charges both india and china have denied stalling the talks . " we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .
within the eu , all 27 members must also agree to support an accord . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" speaking from afghanistan , where he is visiting german forces and development workers , steinmeier said germany would stand by turkey .
he called for those responsible for sunday night 's attack to be brought to account .
the bombs hit the istanbul suburb of gungoren .
officials said people came out into the streets after a loud blast , which was then followed by another larger explostion 10 minutes later .
sixteen people were killed and about 150 injured , the state-run anatolian news agency reported .
no one has yet claimed responsibility for the blasts , the worst attacks in istanbul since 2003 .
turkish newspapers have reported that police are focusing their investigation on the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , saying it had used similar explosives in the past .
bombs coincide with ak party case the bombings came just hours before turkey 's highest judicial body , the constitutional court , was set to begin deliberations on whether to shut down the country 's ruling ak party .
the party stands accused of seeking to introduce islamic rule in turkey , which although mainly muslim , is officially a secular state .
the case has thrown the country in political and economic uncertainty as both local and eu politicians , as well as foreign investors , await the verdict , which analysts say could come by early august . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "

report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "

the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .

" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .
republicans are instead trying to brand the trip - which saw obama stop in afghanistan , iraq , israel , kuwait , jordan , germany , france and the uk - a shallow political stunt . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 . " all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership , " shark said . india rebuffs us charges both india and china have denied stalling the talks . " we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .
within the eu , all 27 members must also agree to support an accord . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 . " all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership , " shark said . india rebuffs us charges both india and china have denied stalling the talks . " we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .
within the eu , all 27 members must also agree to support an accord . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" speaking from afghanistan , where he is visiting german forces and development workers , steinmeier said germany would stand by turkey .
he called for those responsible for sunday night 's attack to be brought to account .
the bombs hit the istanbul suburb of gungoren .
officials said people came out into the streets after a loud blast , which was then followed by another larger explostion 10 minutes later .
sixteen people were killed and about 150 injured , the state-run anatolian news agency reported .
no one has yet claimed responsibility for the blasts , the worst attacks in istanbul since 2003 .
turkish newspapers have reported that police are focusing their investigation on the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , saying it had used similar explosives in the past .
bombs coincide with ak party case the bombings came just hours before turkey 's highest judicial body , the constitutional court , was set to begin deliberations on whether to shut down the country 's ruling ak party .
the party stands accused of seeking to introduce islamic rule in turkey , which although mainly muslim , is officially a secular state .
the case has thrown the country in political and economic uncertainty as both local and eu politicians , as well as foreign investors , await the verdict , which analysts say could come by early august . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2008 opinion : more german troops ca n't help afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says a long visit to afghanistan by the german foreign minister was meant to counter obama 's call for more german troops in the country and show that kabul ca n't be helped by more military power . no leading german politician has spent so much time - four days - visiting afghanistan .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .
you ca n't control the situation with fighter jets .
particularly when you strike those very people who you actually want to protect as has happened so often during attacks . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .
" not only to save the holiday season , but to prevent damage to germany 's air travel industry . " rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike . " even though one must accept a strike being a tool in a labor dispute , it 's still unfortunate that innocent bystanders and holiday travelers will be hurt by the strike more than the union 's opponents , " wend told the welt am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .
you ca n't control the situation with fighter jets .
particularly when you strike those very people who you actually want to protect as has happened so often during attacks . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .
republicans are instead trying to brand the trip - which saw obama stop in afghanistan , iraq , israel , kuwait , jordan , germany , france and the uk - a shallow political stunt . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .

so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .

" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 .

" we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 28.07.2008 played by unscrupulous journalist , obama whines a bit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : careful barack , any one of them could be a reporter from a german tabloid for a man who has faced the issues of race , the connotations his middle name conjures up with some voters , and the fact that he smokes , barack obama seems to have shown his vulnerable side while in berlin . the svelte 46-year-old illinois senator comes across as a man who can facedown most political arguments and also trade dukes if need be with anyone threatening him or his family .
but after a spot of ambush journalism while in the german capital , one starts to wonder if , well , maybe he 's a bit of a wuss . after being photographed smiling accommodatingly with a young german woman in a berlin gym , obama was horrified to find out that the " fan " who he thought was getting a personal snap , was in fact a reporter for the bild zeitung tabloid . not only did the newspaper reproduce the young lady 's photo of the pair without the permission of the presumed presidential candidate 's permission but , worse still , she submitted an accompanying article which alluded to obama 's " firm rear end , " " well-trained arms , " and ended with the phrase , " what a man ! " having been first hijacked in the name of popular journalism and then exploited as presidential eye-candy , obama was apparently wounded by the story : " bild reporter in the gym with obama , " published the day after his triumphant speech at berlin 's victory column on july 24 . the senator-reduced-to-mere-sex-object told the new york times columnist maureen dowd in an interview published over the weekend , that he had been conned and " hustled " . while the times article did n't actually mention any whining , there was a hint of the wounded victim about obama 's recollection of the event . media player obama outplayed by bild reporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shy obama seems to shun the limelight when he minders are n't behind the controls " i 'm just realizing what i 've got to become accustomed to , " he tells dowd in the article .
" the fact that i was played like that at the gym . ...
she hustled us . " we walk into the gym .
she 's already on the treadmill .
she looks like just an ordinary german girl .
she smiles and sort of waves , shyly , but does n't go out of her way to say anything .
as i 'm walking out , she says : ' oh , can i have a picture ?
i 'm a big fan . '
reggie -lrb- his assistant -rrb- takes the picture . "
maybe judith bonesky , the " ordinary german girl , " should have been working out in a filthy trench coat and a trilby hat with a " press " card stuck in its band , just so everyone knew she was a media parasite . despite his protestations , no tangible harm seems to have come from the bild article - unless you count the fact obama showed the same need to control the press exhibited by politicians since time the beginning of politicking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

but after a spot of ambush journalism while in the german capital , one starts to wonder if , well , maybe he 's a bit of a wuss . after being photographed smiling accommodatingly with a young german woman in a berlin gym , obama was horrified to find out that the " fan " who he thought was getting a personal snap , was in fact a reporter for the bild zeitung tabloid . not only did the newspaper reproduce the young lady 's photo of the pair without the permission of the presumed presidential candidate 's permission but , worse still , she submitted an accompanying article which alluded to obama 's " firm rear end , " " well-trained arms , " and ended with the phrase , " what a man ! " having been first hijacked in the name of popular journalism and then exploited as presidential eye-candy , obama was apparently wounded by the story : " bild reporter in the gym with obama , " published the day after his triumphant speech at berlin 's victory column on july 24 . the senator-reduced-to-mere-sex-object told the new york times columnist maureen dowd in an interview published over the weekend , that he had been conned and " hustled " . while the times article did n't actually mention any whining , there was a hint of the wounded victim about obama 's recollection of the event . media player obama outplayed by bild reporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shy obama seems to shun the limelight when he minders are n't behind the controls " i 'm just realizing what i 've got to become accustomed to , " he tells dowd in the article .
" the fact that i was played like that at the gym . ...
she hustled us . " we walk into the gym .
she 's already on the treadmill .
she looks like just an ordinary german girl .
she smiles and sort of waves , shyly , but does n't go out of her way to say anything .
as i 'm walking out , she says : ' oh , can i have a picture ?
i 'm a big fan . '
reggie -lrb- his assistant -rrb- takes the picture . "
maybe judith bonesky , the " ordinary german girl , " should have been working out in a filthy trench coat and a trilby hat with a " press " card stuck in its band , just so everyone knew she was a media parasite . despite his protestations , no tangible harm seems to have come from the bild article - unless you count the fact obama showed the same need to control the press exhibited by politicians since time the beginning of politicking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de mccain takes swipe at obama , germans over berlin visit a spokesman for republican presidential candidate john mccain blasted barack obama for cancelling plans to visit wounded us soldiers while in berlin , adding that the democrat prioritized " throngs of fawning germans . " -lrb- 28.07.2008 -rrb- adoration all round as obama meets sarkozy in the city of love there was no rock star welcome for us presidential candidate barack obama during his visit to paris on friday , july 25 but french president nicolas sarkozy made sure the illinois senator did n't feel unloved .
-lrb- 25.07.2008 -rrb- obama talks of building bridges , dismantling barriers in berlin no nation can face global challenges such as terrorism and climate change alone , barack obama told a cheering crowd of some 100,000 in berlin thursday , july 24 , calling for a new partnership between the us and europe .

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 . " all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership , " shark said . india rebuffs us charges both india and china have denied stalling the talks . " we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .

chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .

such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .

siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "

while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "

the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .

no one has yet claimed responsibility for the blasts , the worst attacks in istanbul since 2003 .
turkish newspapers have reported that police are focusing their investigation on the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , saying it had used similar explosives in the past .
bombs coincide with ak party case the bombings came just hours before turkey 's highest judicial body , the constitutional court , was set to begin deliberations on whether to shut down the country 's ruling ak party .
the party stands accused of seeking to introduce islamic rule in turkey , which although mainly muslim , is officially a secular state .
the case has thrown the country in political and economic uncertainty as both local and eu politicians , as well as foreign investors , await the verdict , which analysts say could come by early august . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .
" not only to save the holiday season , but to prevent damage to germany 's air travel industry . " rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .
" not only to save the holiday season , but to prevent damage to germany 's air travel industry . " rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike . " even though one must accept a strike being a tool in a labor dispute , it 's still unfortunate that innocent bystanders and holiday travelers will be hurt by the strike more than the union 's opponents , " wend told the welt am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .

they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .

the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2008 opinion : more german troops ca n't help afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says a long visit to afghanistan by the german foreign minister was meant to counter obama 's call for more german troops in the country and show that kabul ca n't be helped by more military power . no leading german politician has spent so much time - four days - visiting afghanistan .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 28.07.2008 played by unscrupulous journalist , obama whines a bit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : careful barack , any one of them could be a reporter from a german tabloid for a man who has faced the issues of race , the connotations his middle name conjures up with some voters , and the fact that he smokes , barack obama seems to have shown his vulnerable side while in berlin . the svelte 46-year-old illinois senator comes across as a man who can facedown most political arguments and also trade dukes if need be with anyone threatening him or his family .
but after a spot of ambush journalism while in the german capital , one starts to wonder if , well , maybe he 's a bit of a wuss . after being photographed smiling accommodatingly with a young german woman in a berlin gym , obama was horrified to find out that the " fan " who he thought was getting a personal snap , was in fact a reporter for the bild zeitung tabloid . not only did the newspaper reproduce the young lady 's photo of the pair without the permission of the presumed presidential candidate 's permission but , worse still , she submitted an accompanying article which alluded to obama 's " firm rear end , " " well-trained arms , " and ended with the phrase , " what a man ! " having been first hijacked in the name of popular journalism and then exploited as presidential eye-candy , obama was apparently wounded by the story : " bild reporter in the gym with obama , " published the day after his triumphant speech at berlin 's victory column on july 24 . the senator-reduced-to-mere-sex-object told the new york times columnist maureen dowd in an interview published over the weekend , that he had been conned and " hustled " . while the times article did n't actually mention any whining , there was a hint of the wounded victim about obama 's recollection of the event . media player obama outplayed by bild reporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shy obama seems to shun the limelight when he minders are n't behind the controls " i 'm just realizing what i 've got to become accustomed to , " he tells dowd in the article .
" the fact that i was played like that at the gym . ...
she hustled us . " we walk into the gym .
she 's already on the treadmill .
she looks like just an ordinary german girl .
she smiles and sort of waves , shyly , but does n't go out of her way to say anything .
as i 'm walking out , she says : ' oh , can i have a picture ?
i 'm a big fan . '
reggie -lrb- his assistant -rrb- takes the picture . "

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .
republicans are instead trying to brand the trip - which saw obama stop in afghanistan , iraq , israel , kuwait , jordan , germany , france and the uk - a shallow political stunt . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .
" not only to save the holiday season , but to prevent damage to germany 's air travel industry . " rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike . " even though one must accept a strike being a tool in a labor dispute , it 's still unfortunate that innocent bystanders and holiday travelers will be hurt by the strike more than the union 's opponents , " wend told the welt am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2008 opinion : more german troops ca n't help afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says a long visit to afghanistan by the german foreign minister was meant to counter obama 's call for more german troops in the country and show that kabul ca n't be helped by more military power . no leading german politician has spent so much time - four days - visiting afghanistan .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .
you ca n't control the situation with fighter jets .
particularly when you strike those very people who you actually want to protect as has happened so often during attacks . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .
you ca n't control the situation with fighter jets .
particularly when you strike those very people who you actually want to protect as has happened so often during attacks . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but after a spot of ambush journalism while in the german capital , one starts to wonder if , well , maybe he 's a bit of a wuss . after being photographed smiling accommodatingly with a young german woman in a berlin gym , obama was horrified to find out that the " fan " who he thought was getting a personal snap , was in fact a reporter for the bild zeitung tabloid . not only did the newspaper reproduce the young lady 's photo of the pair without the permission of the presumed presidential candidate 's permission but , worse still , she submitted an accompanying article which alluded to obama 's " firm rear end , " " well-trained arms , " and ended with the phrase , " what a man ! " having been first hijacked in the name of popular journalism and then exploited as presidential eye-candy , obama was apparently wounded by the story : " bild reporter in the gym with obama , " published the day after his triumphant speech at berlin 's victory column on july 24 . the senator-reduced-to-mere-sex-object told the new york times columnist maureen dowd in an interview published over the weekend , that he had been conned and " hustled " . while the times article did n't actually mention any whining , there was a hint of the wounded victim about obama 's recollection of the event . media player obama outplayed by bild reporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shy obama seems to shun the limelight when he minders are n't behind the controls " i 'm just realizing what i 've got to become accustomed to , " he tells dowd in the article .

it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .

so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

" speaking from afghanistan , where he is visiting german forces and development workers , steinmeier said germany would stand by turkey .
he called for those responsible for sunday night 's attack to be brought to account .
the bombs hit the istanbul suburb of gungoren .
officials said people came out into the streets after a loud blast , which was then followed by another larger explostion 10 minutes later .
sixteen people were killed and about 150 injured , the state-run anatolian news agency reported .
no one has yet claimed responsibility for the blasts , the worst attacks in istanbul since 2003 .
turkish newspapers have reported that police are focusing their investigation on the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , saying it had used similar explosives in the past .
bombs coincide with ak party case the bombings came just hours before turkey 's highest judicial body , the constitutional court , was set to begin deliberations on whether to shut down the country 's ruling ak party .
the party stands accused of seeking to introduce islamic rule in turkey , which although mainly muslim , is officially a secular state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.07.2008 former siemens executive given suspended jail sentence , fined großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard s. is the first former executive to receive a sentence in the bribery scandal in the first of a series of verdicts on bribery at siemens , a munich court handed a suspended two-year jail term and fine monday , july 28 to a former executive at the german electronics and engineering group . reinhard s. , who was a senior figure in siemens ' icn division , which builds fixed-line telephone exchanges , was convicted of 49 counts of being a party to misappropriation of corporate funds .
the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .
you ca n't control the situation with fighter jets .
particularly when you strike those very people who you actually want to protect as has happened so often during attacks . peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and an expert on the middle east -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 .

he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries .

" for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .
" not only to save the holiday season , but to prevent damage to germany 's air travel industry . " rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .
" not only to save the holiday season , but to prevent damage to germany 's air travel industry . " rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike . " even though one must accept a strike being a tool in a labor dispute , it 's still unfortunate that innocent bystanders and holiday travelers will be hurt by the strike more than the union 's opponents , " wend told the welt am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he called for those responsible for sunday night 's attack to be brought to account .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .

emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .

so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .
that 's why it seemed important to steinmeier to emphasize germany 's contribution until now with his long stay in afghanistan . of course , the german army , police and aid workers in afghanistan have been doing a lot of good .
but providing drinking water , building schools or training the afghan police alone ca n't be the answer to the country 's problems .
it was clear when the taliban were toppled seven years ago that afghanistan needs to be fundamentally reformed while at the same time protecting traditions and creating new power structures .
that has n't happened .
from the old warlords to corruption and blooming opium plantations - much has remained the same . even the police have little motivation to sacrifice themselves for bettering afghanistan .

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 . " all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership , " shark said . india rebuffs us charges both india and china have denied stalling the talks . " we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .
within the eu , all 27 members must also agree to support an accord . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.07.2008 former siemens executive given suspended jail sentence , fined großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard s. is the first former executive to receive a sentence in the bribery scandal in the first of a series of verdicts on bribery at siemens , a munich court handed a suspended two-year jail term and fine monday , july 28 to a former executive at the german electronics and engineering group . reinhard s. , who was a senior figure in siemens ' icn division , which builds fixed-line telephone exchanges , was convicted of 49 counts of being a party to misappropriation of corporate funds .
the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "

but after a spot of ambush journalism while in the german capital , one starts to wonder if , well , maybe he 's a bit of a wuss . after being photographed smiling accommodatingly with a young german woman in a berlin gym , obama was horrified to find out that the " fan " who he thought was getting a personal snap , was in fact a reporter for the bild zeitung tabloid . not only did the newspaper reproduce the young lady 's photo of the pair without the permission of the presumed presidential candidate 's permission but , worse still , she submitted an accompanying article which alluded to obama 's " firm rear end , " " well-trained arms , " and ended with the phrase , " what a man ! " having been first hijacked in the name of popular journalism and then exploited as presidential eye-candy , obama was apparently wounded by the story : " bild reporter in the gym with obama , " published the day after his triumphant speech at berlin 's victory column on july 24 . the senator-reduced-to-mere-sex-object told the new york times columnist maureen dowd in an interview published over the weekend , that he had been conned and " hustled " . while the times article did n't actually mention any whining , there was a hint of the wounded victim about obama 's recollection of the event . media player obama outplayed by bild reporter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shy obama seems to shun the limelight when he minders are n't behind the controls " i 'm just realizing what i 've got to become accustomed to , " he tells dowd in the article .
" the fact that i was played like that at the gym . ...
she hustled us . " we walk into the gym .
she 's already on the treadmill .
she looks like just an ordinary german girl .
she smiles and sort of waves , shyly , but does n't go out of her way to say anything .
as i 'm walking out , she says : ' oh , can i have a picture ?
i 'm a big fan . '
reggie -lrb- his assistant -rrb- takes the picture . "
maybe judith bonesky , the " ordinary german girl , " should have been working out in a filthy trench coat and a trilby hat with a " press " card stuck in its band , just so everyone knew she was a media parasite . despite his protestations , no tangible harm seems to have come from the bild article - unless you count the fact obama showed the same need to control the press exhibited by politicians since time the beginning of politicking . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "

it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .
the gfk consumer climate survey has been conducted since 1980 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did n't just limit his trip to the obligatory meeting with troops or a photo-op with afghan president hamid karzai .
he also visited german aid projects in the provinces , including a water treatment project in heart and a training course for afghan police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp during his trip , steinmeier concluded with resignation that security has worsened in the country when compared to the past years , and he largely blamed pakistan 's negative influence for the deterioration .
but the foreign minister 's warning that islamabad needs to change its stance is likely to fall on deaf ears among the pakistani military and the ideological supporters of the taliban .
all the more so because germany has nothing to threaten the country with .
how about that it wo n't buy any more soccer balls made by pakistani children ? the german foreign minister did n't travel to afghanistan to supervise humanitarian projects or as a representative of a regional power determined to bring order to afghanistan .
instead , the timing of his visit had much to do with presumptive us democratic candidate barack obama 's much-talked about visit to berlin and his clear-cut call for germany to do more for the " mission " in afghanistan by sending more troops .
it 's a " mission " whose declared aim is to fight terrorism but it has n't managed to catch al-qaeda leaders who have allegedly been sheltering in the pakistan-afghanistan border , nor has it managed to prevent the taliban from regrouping . obama has spoken of diverting us troops from iraq to afghanistan and he seems , just like the current head of the white house , to erroneously believe that you can stem and even successfully defeat terrorism and islamic extremism with weapons .
he also wants the world to help in the endeavor . obama wo n't manage to sell this to war-weary american citizens very easily .
and a government in berlin - whether it 's the current grand coalition or another constellation - will not overcome its reluctance and significantly raise its military involvement in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.07.2008 klinsmann : lack of cash no excuse for failure in european soccer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi will not resort to tired excuses about lack of funds should bayern falter in europe it 's been six years since a bundesliga team graced the final of the champions league .
the most popular reason appears to be lack of cash .
however , the bundesliga 's newest coach does n't want to hear excuses about money . new bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann is a man who does n't go looking for excuses in the event of defeat and wo n't be resorting to the currently popular argument that german teams lack financial clout should his team fail tot perform in europe this season .
klinsmann not only faces a baptism of fire in his new job when he attempts to retain the bundesliga title in his first season as a league coach but he also takes on the heavy burden that all bayern coaches have been saddled with ; that of bringing the european cup back to munich .
bayern were the last german club to deliver in the champions league way back in 2001 , but the bavarian giants and their compatriots have faltered annually in europe 's premier cup competition ever since .
bayer leverkusen were the last german side to feature in the champions league final in 2002 .
analysis of the situation has left many scratching their heads and has led to some lazy conclusions ; mainly that it is the lack of financial fire-power which undermines german attempts to win the prize .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi believes success comes from player development " i do not accept the argument about the lack of finances amongst our clubs compared to europe 's top clubs , " klinsmann told sunday 's edition of the sueddeutsche zeitung .
" the top 15 clubs are all equipped with good international players and in the long-term , it is more important to have a good , hard-working team ethic than a hundred transfers .
" if i can work with a top team , we can do the same at bayern as if we had 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78.4 million -rrb- to spend on players , given enough chances this team will develop , " klinsmann added .
" my job is to improve my players in such a way that we can compete against the financially strong clubs such as chelsea or milan . "
klinsi echoes loew 's view of germany 's european efforts klinsmann 's view echoes that of his successor as national team coach , joachim loew .
last season , at the point when it looked as though no german teams would make it to the knock-out phase of the champions league or uefa cup , loew said the lack of financial resources was not the only reason why bundesliga clubs continued to struggle in europe .
while he accepted that the top teams in other european countries , like england for example , have an infinitely larger budget than their bundesliga counterparts , loew insisted there was much more than just finances behind the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew says factors other than just money lead to success " the money is only part of the reason , i see no reason to believe norway 's rosenborg are any richer than the german clubs , " loew told german tabloid bild in november .
" but the norwegians are a good example of a system where they develop players , while arsenal and manchester united focus on continuity and have had the same coaches for years . "
at the close of the 2007/2008 season , germany 's schalke 04 had made it as far as the quarter-finals of the champions league , losing over two legs to barcelona , while bayern lost to eventual winners zenith st. petersburg in the semi-final of the uefa cup .
rummenigge bemoans size of bundelsiga tv pot klinsmann 's comments on the financial situation of the bundesliga clubs comes hot on the heels of a statement from his club 's chief executive karl-heinz rummenigge who said that the future for germany clubs in europe was bleak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rummenigge , left , says the bundesliga 's future is bleak rummenigge said that the on-going wrangle in germany concerning the amount of money bundesliga clubs will get for the screening of live soccer would ultimately affect their ability to contest the big prizes .
rummenigge deplored the situation in germany where the federal cartel office has ruled the current television contract to broadcast live bundesliga games is a monopoly and must be re-negotiated - which could cost germany 's clubs millions of euros in lost revenue .
rummenigge 's comments come less than two months after an independent report showed the bundesliga to be the most profitable league in europe , beating even the english premier league .
report shows bundesliga in healthy financial state the annual review of soccer finance , published by accountancy firm deloitte at the end of may , showed that the 18 clubs in germany 's top league earned a profit of 250 million euros , or 18 per cent of its revenue , in the 2006/2007 season .
although premier league income soared above the 2 billion-euro mark for the first time to reach 2.3 billion euros , profit came to 141 million euros as the league 's growth in revenue has been offset by higher wage bills .
the report said the premier league generated about a quarter of the combined 13.6 billion-euro revenue of europe 's leagues , an increase of one billion euros over the previous year .
but english clubs spent much of their spiraling revenue in attracting and keeping players , with wages growing by 13 percent to more than 1.77 billion euros - more than twice that in spain , germany , france or italy , the report said .
however , german clubs had benefited from the ability to keep players ' salaries at a lower level .
while salary levels as a percentage of turnover was between 62 percent and 64 percent of the leading leagues in england , spain , italy and france , the bundesliga was around 45 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesliga consistently boasts huge , enthusiastic crowds stefan ludwig , senior manager of deloitte in germany , said the financial gap to the premier league would grow but the bundesliga was well-equipped to compete for second place in view of booming spectator levels and increased television income .
" against the general trend of increased income being invested in equal measure in transfers and wages , bundesliga clubs are continuing their spending policies of the previous years , " he said .
" as a result , the bundesliga will become more attractive for potential investors who in the past had shown little interest in the league . "
all of which could mean that russian or american billionaires , soccer 's current sugar-daddies , could turn their attention to bundesliga clubs in the future and kill the poorhouse excuse forever . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .
republicans are instead trying to brand the trip - which saw obama stop in afghanistan , iraq , israel , kuwait , jordan , germany , france and the uk - a shallow political stunt . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 . " all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership , " shark said . india rebuffs us charges both india and china have denied stalling the talks . " we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .
within the eu , all 27 members must also agree to support an accord . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hours before obama arrived back in the us on saturday , mccain 's spokesman tucker bounds questioned why the democratic senator cancelled friday 's scheduled meeting with american troops at the landstuhl military hospital in germany .
" you know , it really speaks to the experience that barack obama lacks , " bounds told fox news .
" he prioritizes throngs of fawning germans over meeting with wounded combat troops in germany , " he added , referring to the crowd of over 200,000 people who gave obama an effusive welcome at his outdoor address on thursday evening in berlin .
mccain 's team also raised the cancelled hospital visit in a new television ad in which a narrator berates obama for making time to go to the gym , but not finding the time for injured soldiers .
obama team sought to protect soldiers the obama campaign explained at the time of the cancellation that the senator had made a decision to avoid drawing wounded troops into the back-and-forth of campaign politics .
the campaign also noted that reservations about the visit had been expressed by the pentagon .
some analysts see the mccain team 's attack as a case of sour grapes following the overwhelmingly positive public response to obama in europe .
republicans are instead trying to brand the trip - which saw obama stop in afghanistan , iraq , israel , kuwait , jordan , germany , france and the uk - a shallow political stunt . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .

" rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.07.2008 former siemens executive given suspended jail sentence , fined großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard s. is the first former executive to receive a sentence in the bribery scandal in the first of a series of verdicts on bribery at siemens , a munich court handed a suspended two-year jail term and fine monday , july 28 to a former executive at the german electronics and engineering group . reinhard s. , who was a senior figure in siemens ' icn division , which builds fixed-line telephone exchanges , was convicted of 49 counts of being a party to misappropriation of corporate funds .
the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" speaking from afghanistan , where he is visiting german forces and development workers , steinmeier said germany would stand by turkey .
he called for those responsible for sunday night 's attack to be brought to account .
the bombs hit the istanbul suburb of gungoren .
officials said people came out into the streets after a loud blast , which was then followed by another larger explostion 10 minutes later .
sixteen people were killed and about 150 injured , the state-run anatolian news agency reported .
no one has yet claimed responsibility for the blasts , the worst attacks in istanbul since 2003 .
turkish newspapers have reported that police are focusing their investigation on the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , saying it had used similar explosives in the past .
bombs coincide with ak party case the bombings came just hours before turkey 's highest judicial body , the constitutional court , was set to begin deliberations on whether to shut down the country 's ruling ak party .
the party stands accused of seeking to introduce islamic rule in turkey , which although mainly muslim , is officially a secular state .
the case has thrown the country in political and economic uncertainty as both local and eu politicians , as well as foreign investors , await the verdict , which analysts say could come by early august . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am very concerned it will jeopardize the outcome of this round , " she said . european union trade commissioner peter mandelson said the talks were at a difficult and complicated stage and more time was needed . the meeting , which follows seven years of stalemate , is aimed at saving the so-called doha round which seeks to liberalize trade by reducing import tariffs and trade-distorting subsidies . the talks have been jammed for years because of differing and unbridgeable demands of industrialized and developing nations . talks in " gravest jeopardy " at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing for developing countries to reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years of talks have not been enough to reach a deal 153 wto members can agree on both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions . on monday , the us said india and china 's resistance to a new tenuous agreement reached among six of seven major trading economies last week was holding up a deal . david shark , deputy us ambassador to the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , said beijing and delhi 's opposition to opening up their markets to more imports had thrown the global trade talks into their " gravest jeopardy " since their launch in 2001 . " all their invocations of development during the past years ring hollow when these major players threaten the development benefits already on the table that are absolutely vital to the vast majority of the membership , " shark said . india rebuffs us charges both india and china have denied stalling the talks . " we are not holding up the talks , " india 's commerce minister kamal nath told the afp news agency .
" who 's holding up this round i think are the large developed countries ... who are looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nath is not willing to give further ground nath also said after the evening 's meeting with the six trading powers that he never signed up to the compromise package , but he was " still optimistic " a deal could be reached . nath told reporters that priorities included deeper cuts in farm subsidies in the us and the eu than the current package allows .
he also said developing countries need a better " special safeguard mechanism " to help ward off import surges or price collapses in farm products and long-awaited action on us cotton subsidies , which hurt farmers in developing countries . china 's wto ambassador sun zhenyu told delegates , " it is a little surprising that at this time the us started this finger-pointing . " nine eu members add fuel to fire while there have been calls from ministers to keep a cool head and remind participants of what 's at stake if they fail to reach a deal , france added fuel to the fire by complaining about the fairness about the proposed deal . french president nicolas sarkozy is reported to have called eu commission chief jose manuel barroso over the weekend for an explanation and also demanded that eu 's chief trade negotiator peter mandelson travel to paris to explain his position . france , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , on monday it would not sign proposals for a trade pact as they stand because they show no progress on " essential " matters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labeling requirements are one issue of the wto talks french government spokesman luc chatel mentioned " the protection of indications of geographical origin , " in a reference to such issues as the labeling of wine , and " the defense of our european industrial interests in the face of emerging countries . " eight other eu states , ireland , poland , hungary , greece , portugal , lithuania , cyprus and italy , joined in sarkozy 's call for mandelson to take a tough stand in representing the 27-member bloc 's interests . " for too long , europe has got way too little from emerging countries like india , china and brazil in exchange for its concessions , " a spokesman for italy 's chief negotiator adolfo urso told the afp news agency . mandelson , the eu 's trade commissioner and former british cabinet minister is viewed with suspicion in paris as a so-called " neo-liberal " who would be willing to sacrifice france 's vast agricultural sector for the sake of a global trade deal . any final deal must be approved by all 153 members .
within the eu , all 27 members must also agree to support an accord . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many householders who were cheered by pay hikes earlier in the year reported fresh worries that inflation would claw back their gains .
this drove gfk 's separate index of income expectations down to minus 20 , the lowest level since august 2004 .
but a further index , reflecting interest in buying things , was only slightly down .
" fear of shrinking purchasing power has led to a renewed reduction in the propensity to buy , although the drop is markedly more moderate than the fall in the indicator for income expectations , " gfk said .
" record price increases , triggered primarily by rocketing energy prices , are leaving consumers increasingly fearful of their purchasing power . "
in june , consumer prices in the biggest european economy rose by 3.3 percent in june on a 12-month basis , the biggest increase since december 1993 .
employment and wages the gfk also said that the effects of increased employment and wages had also led to confidence being " demolished " by inflation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher salaries are supposed to keep the wolf from the door " the positive momentum generated by the job market and the beneficial wage and salary increases compared with last year are consequently being demolished by inflation , " gfk said .
income expectations fell to their lowest level since november 2005 , " in light of growing fears of a recession and the fact that the crisis in the financial markets seems far from over , " it added .

" there have been no cancellations or delays caused by the strike thus far , " lufthansa spokesman peter schneckenleitner told german national television monday , july 28 , adding that 600 takeoffs had been cleared as planned by midday at the height of the holiday season . verdi , germany 's second largest union with 2.2 million members , said 4,000 workers had joined the strike by midday , with more to follow from the late shifts .
the union is demanding a substantial pay rise for 50,000 workers . the strike , the first open-ended work stoppage at lufthansa in 13 years , threatens to hit areas from catering and cargo to maintenance and repairs . union says strike will cause lufthansa dearly verdi pay talks head erhard ott acknowledged that there had been little observable effect on flights .
but measures put in place by the airline to ensure continued service were costing " really a lot of money , " he claimed . bildunterschrift : fears of cancellations and stranded travelers were not entirely founded some analysts have put the cost of the strike at about 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.85 million -rrb- per day for lufthansa . lufthansa officials have said their emergency measures included transferring passengers to other flights , shifting staff to cover gaps and possibly using other airlines ' catering services . the union targeted lufthansa 's main hub frankfurt and the northern city of hamburg on the first day of the strike .
pilots are not involved in the current labor action . ott said the main aim of the strike was not to target passengers but to hurt the company financially by forcing it to take costly emergency measures to maintain services . the union predicted lufthansa would soon begin to feel the effects of the strike by aircraft maintenance workers . " after a week , it will really start to hurt , " said hauke brockmann , a verdi official in hamburg . unions in combative mood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone at lufthansa took part in the first day of the strike lufthansa communications chief klaus walther appealed to the union to return to talks . verdi is demanding for 9.8 percent more pay for 50,000 ground and cabin staff .
lufthansa , the second-biggest european airline after air france-klm , in terms of passenger numbers , is offering 6.7 percent over 21 months and a one-time payment . other unions have not heeded verdi 's strike call .
they include the ufo union , which claims to be the main union for cabin crew , and is demanding a 15 percent pay rise for its members . last week , in a separate strike , pilots at two lufthansa subsidiaries came out on strike for 36 hours , causing 900 flights to be cancelled . several german unions are seeking more pay after relative restraint in recent years as inflation spirals in europe 's biggest economy . the strike comes at a time when airlines around the world are facing pressure to cut costs amid cripplingly high fuel bills as the world economy slows . verdi has said it is open to new talks if lufthansa improves its offer .
wage talks broke down on july 10 . strike sparks criticism verdi 's strike has sparked heavy criticism from political and industry leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike is hitting when many people are leaving on vacation " we 've got to do everything we can to prevent this strike , " said klaus lippold , a member of parliament and transport expert for the christian democrats .
" not only to save the holiday season , but to prevent damage to germany 's air travel industry . " rainer wend , an economy expert in parliament for the social democrats , also spoke out against the strike . " even though one must accept a strike being a tool in a labor dispute , it 's still unfortunate that innocent bystanders and holiday travelers will be hurt by the strike more than the union 's opponents , " wend told the welt am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.07.2008 former siemens executive given suspended jail sentence , fined großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard s. is the first former executive to receive a sentence in the bribery scandal in the first of a series of verdicts on bribery at siemens , a munich court handed a suspended two-year jail term and fine monday , july 28 to a former executive at the german electronics and engineering group . reinhard s. , who was a senior figure in siemens ' icn division , which builds fixed-line telephone exchanges , was convicted of 49 counts of being a party to misappropriation of corporate funds .
the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .

at official list prices , the value of the 60-plane order is some $ 13 billion -lrb- 8.25 billion euros -rrb- .
the colorful handover ceremony monday was the first from a new a380 delivery centre set up by airbus in hamburg to accommodate airlines during the weeks of testing before the money is handed over and a jet is flown away .
the only other a380s yet in service are two with singapore airlines .
they were picked up from the airbus fuselage factory in toulouse , france , which divides up the tasks of manufacture with the hamburg factory .
the chief of the united arab emirates airline , sheikh ahmed bin saeed al-maktoum , said the airline had ordered 30 of the a350 model and 30 of the a330-300 jets .
it had already ordered 58 of the biggest in airbus ' range , the a380 .
" the future has arrived , " he said of the jumbo 's start of service , adding to hundreds of airbus staff : " thank you .
you have made history . "
emirates expanding fast bildunterschrift : after taking delivery of the a380 , emirates airways ordered 60 more airbus planes dubai-based emirates has grown fast thanks to fares which are sometimes lower than those at its competitors , massive investment based on the uae oil wealth and tight payroll costs with its aircraft crews hired from all over the world .
its pilots hail from 83 nations .
in the year ended march 31 , 2008 , it carried 21.2 million passengers , an increase of 3.7 million from the previous year .
emirates currently operates 117 planes .
after the new purchases and retiring older planes , it aims to have a fleet of 150 .
emirates is the largest customer to date for the flagship of the airbus range .
al-maktoum said the north american continent was one of the company 's key markets and that the airline was pleased to be the first to enter the us market with the new a380 .
the aircraft , which has seats for 489 passengers , was to leave the north german port city tuesday , before being put to work on the dubai-new york route from august 1 .
superjumbo orders grow despite delays bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singapore airlines already has an a380 in operation singapore airlines ' two a380 jets were delivered from airbus ' main french plant at toulouse in october and january respectively .
these aircraft ply the singapore-sydney and singapore-london routes .
so far airbus has taken orders for 198 of the double-deck a380s , which have a list price of 210 million euros -lrb- $ 330 million -rrb- .
the huge aircraft made its maiden flight on april 27 , 2005 , but problems with the complex wiring and friction between the two factories led to a two-year delay in the delivery schedule .
the wiring problem is still slowing the production line , and airbus chief executive thomas enders said the aircraft 's problems will only be over once series production is running smoothly at a considerably higher rate than the current one per month .
" the challenge we face is speeding up production , " he told the hamburg daily hamburger abendblatt .
airbus currently aims to deliver 35 of the aircraft by the end of next year .
neither singapore nor emirates has chosen a configuration with anywhere near the maximum number of seats - 853 .
reflecting its franco-german heritage , airbus builds the hulls of the two-deck planes in toulouse , france and paints them and fits the seats in hamburg , sharing out most of the work equally .

the case of the defendant and others revealed that some siemens divisions were using kickbacks to officials and purchasing executives in greece , italy and other nations to win major contracts .
slush funds hidden in the siemens accounts were used as a conduit for the bribery .
the defendant admitted in court that he helped create the slush funds and front companies , which were the mechanism used to pay " consultancy " fees to corrupt foreign officials who were open to bribery .
in reality , the recipients did not provide any consulting time to the front companies , but simply influenced buying decisions to favor siemens .
the defendant was not charged with paying the actual bribes .
presiding judge peter noll handed him a fine of 108,000 euros -lrb- $ 169,000 -rrb- .
siemens facing further court cases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gloom has well and truly settled over siemens siemens has been preparing for its executives to be dragged through the courts since admitting it had found evidence of significant kickbacks in a total of six divisions in january .
siemens had previously stressed that its division supplying telephone switching equipment was the main one that spent a total of 1.3 billion euros improperly .
chief financial officer joe kaeser said that the total included huge , unexplained payments to " consultants " by a division supplying power-generation equipment .
similar payments , thought to mask bribes to corrupt staff of siemens customers , were also detected on a lesser scale in transport systems , energy distribution , medical technology and industrial services .
the scandal attached to the healthcare sector claimed the job of department chief erich reinhardt who resigned in april .
shareholders refuse indemnity for management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loescher is the only executive granted indemnity amid suggestions that board members may have been aware of the bribery , shareholders agreed by a 9:1 margin to not yet grant indemnity to most of the management board other than siemens ' new chief executive , peter loescher .
such indemnity , normally passed as a matter of routine at german companies , protects executives from damages claims for any wrongdoing for past acts .
in a bid to find and punish the key executives behind the corrupt practices in greece , italy and other nations , siemens investigators have offered an amnesty to smaller fish who reveal their role in the kickbacks .
siemens is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

welsh camping sites report healthy summer bookings while sales of camping equipment are strong .
compared to a family holiday abroad costing thousands , a cheap break under canvas can be an attractive alternative .
dave beynon , of three cliffs bay holiday park on the gower , said he was having to turn away 100 customers a day .
" camping can buck the trend because it 's inexpensive , " he said .
" you can come here with a family and it would cost £ 105 for a week .
" the last time i went to london , it cost me that for a room for one night . "
mark palmer , site manager of gilestone farm caravan and camping park at talybont-on-usk near brecon , said he had seen a huge increase recently in the number of campers . "

" the last three or four years we 've been running it , it 's been one or two or three nights , but this last few weeks we 've been taking families for a week , " she said .

" i think it 's a knock-on effect of the poor weather last year , and the cost of fuel is certainly deterring some people , " he said .
' yurts ' julian burrell , chairman of the wales tourism alliance , claimed a number of factors were playing a part in making camping attractive .
he said short breaks were more popular and there was now a market for environmentally-friendly holidays .
" that includes the top end of the camping market like yurts , which are coming into their own , " he said .
sales of camping equipment are also proving resistant to the current financial squeeze .

' inflatable ' outdoor clothing and equipment company gelert , based in porthmadog , said sales of tents had increased .
" we 've seen significant growth this year and , as well as the credit crunch , it 's also a lot to do with health trends , " said a spokeswoman .

welsh camping sites report healthy summer bookings while sales of camping equipment are strong .
compared to a family holiday abroad costing thousands , a cheap break under canvas can be an attractive alternative .
dave beynon , of three cliffs bay holiday park on the gower , said he was having to turn away 100 customers a day .
" camping can buck the trend because it 's inexpensive , " he said .
" you can come here with a family and it would cost £ 105 for a week .
" the last time i went to london , it cost me that for a room for one night . "
mark palmer , site manager of gilestone farm caravan and camping park at talybont-on-usk near brecon , said he had seen a huge increase recently in the number of campers .
it 's not just basic canvas under a tree any more , it 's quite sophisticated malcolm bonas , gwent camping and leisure " we 've got 60 per cent more campers this year and we 've added more room for them , " he said .
" we 've put it down to the credit crunch , that 's all it is . "
fiona davies , manager of llwyn celyn bach camping site in llanberis , said families appeared to be booking longer breaks .
" the last three or four years we 've been running it , it 's been one or two or three nights , but this last few weeks we 've been taking families for a week , " she said .
but the school holidays got off to a slow start for viv james , director of trefalun park in tenby , although the site is fully booked up for the rest of the summer .
" i think it 's a knock-on effect of the poor weather last year , and the cost of fuel is certainly deterring some people , " he said .
' yurts ' julian burrell , chairman of the wales tourism alliance , claimed a number of factors were playing a part in making camping attractive .
he said short breaks were more popular and there was now a market for environmentally-friendly holidays .
" that includes the top end of the camping market like yurts , which are coming into their own , " he said .
sales of camping equipment are also proving resistant to the current financial squeeze .
blacks leisure has just reported healthy july sales and said customers were ditching foreign holidays for camping trips .
and tesco direct said its sales of camping equipment had increased by 38 % since july last year .
' inflatable ' outdoor clothing and equipment company gelert , based in porthmadog , said sales of tents had increased .
" we 've seen significant growth this year and , as well as the credit crunch , it 's also a lot to do with health trends , " said a spokeswoman .
she said there was now more of an emphasis on keeping active and maintaining a work-life balance , and camping was benefiting from this .
malcolm bonas , sales manager of gwent camping and leisure in newport , said sales of accessories were holding up well , including some of the more unusual items .
" it 's not just basic canvas under a tree any more , it 's quite sophisticated , " he said .
" you can get inflatable three-piece suites and we sold out of them last year .
" we 've had a couple in this year and they 've sold too . "

the verdi public sector union called the strike after 90.7 % of its members supported the walk-out over pay .
the union wants a pay rise of 9.8 % , while the airline is offering 6.7 % in two stages , according to the union .
lufthansa , which like other airlines is also being squeezed by rising fuel bills , said the stoppage had so far barely disrupted flights .
" almost 100 % of our flights are flying on time , " lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told germany 's zdf channel .
lufthansa transports 150,000 people daily on average , and july is one of its busiest months .
it employs 100,000 people .
however , union negotiator erhard ott said that the effects of the strike would " likely grow in the course of the day and in coming days " .
verdi represents 52,000 air industry workers .
demands for higher pay come as inflation in europe 's largest economy has quickened .
as well as workers in the airline industry , rail workers and teachers went on strike earlier this year demanding higher pay .
the european central bank increased interest rates earlier this month for the first time in a year in an attempt to control inflation , which is at record levels in the eurozone .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking shop : alexandra patsavas bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture 07:41 gmt , monday , 28 july 2008 08:41 uk talking shop : alexandra patsavas you might not recognise her name , but alexandra patsavas is one of the most important people in the record industry .
as the music supervisor on hit shows like the oc , grey 's anatomy and gossip girl , she reaches millions of television viewers every week , and has the power to make or break a band .
the oc , in particular , helped to push the killers , death cab for cutie and imogen heap into the limelight - and established artists like coldplay and beck soon started offering exclusive first plays of their material to the show .
patsavas explains how a typical show comes together - and lets us peek at the " recent tracks " playlist on her ipod .
how do you go about choosing what goes onto the soundtrack for a show ?
grey 's anatomy , for example , gets a compilation cd every couple of weeks filled with current music that i 've discussed with the executive producers and which they feel is great for the sound of the show .
sometimes we pitch for an edited scene and sometimes the writers fall in love with a song and write it into the first outline of the script .
which do you prefer ?
oh , both ways .
we use so much music that if a writer is inspired by a song and we can clear the rights , most often it works beautifully with the scene .
but sometimes it 's not exactly as the writer had envisioned and we pitch alternates .
how hard is it to suppress your own taste in music and choose the right song for a particular scene ?
you know , the great thing about this job is that you do n't have to be so straight and narrow .
i certainly have music that i love , but you begin to appreciate the best of every genre .
i 'm working on a show called mad men which takes place in the early 1960s , so most of the songs are from that period , which is a totally different way of listening to music .
do you get a shiver down your spine when you 're looking through those 1960s record collections and come across something rare or new ?
oh it 's definitely thrilling !
the part that can not be so thrilling is the challenging rights dance - making sure that this unknown gem is owned by someone or there 's a company that can license it .
sometimes , the writer ca n't be found - especially if it 's catalogue material - and there 's no way around that .
do you work hard to track down new bands ?
the film music business is well organised , so there are great companies that pitch music to supervisors like me but we also have individuals worldwide making blind submissions .
is there a big team of assistants sifting through the garbage to find the nugget of gold ?
you know what ?
there 's a lot of gold !
but definitely , they spend a lot of time listening .
the last five artists played on alex patsavas 's ipod anna ternheim secret machines anya marina the little ones ambulance ltd you seem to pick a lot of british acts for your shows - the kaiser chiefs , duffy , super furry animals , to name a few .
do you pay particular attention to the music scene over here ?
i grew up in the 1980s and my focus was definitely on the great music coming out of the uk at that point , so i think i have a special love for it .
but , with work , the important thing is not where music comes from , it 's more about where it fits .
is there pressure to make the music cool ?
i always thought summer roberts -lrb- rachel bilson 's socialite character in the oc -rrb- would have been more into christina aguilera than death cab for cutie .
josh schwartz wrote those characters to be in tune with pop culture .
seth -lrb- summer 's love interest -rrb- certainly loved his death cab and his indie rock .
summer was fashionable , but maybe she was hipster and she liked cool music .
anyway , we definitely had a few references to favourite songs from the 80s .
some journey , some boys ii men .
do you ever get to the point where you ca n't discern the good songs from the bad ?
you can always discern the bad !
you can get a little deaf after a while and it becomes hard to hear good .
but the bad always , always sticks out .
would you say there are similarities between you and the guys in high fidelity ?
-lsb- laughs -rsb- i have more friends and relatives !
i 'm more a part of my social world .
but i am fanatical about music , just like those characters .
alexandra patsavas was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter mark savage .

the german-born musician got his big break playing keyboards on the buggles ' number one hit video killed the radio star , before making the leap into film under the tutelage of british musician stanley myers .
an oscar-winner for the lion king , he has recently finished work on batman : the dark knight , which he co-wrote with his friend james newton-howard .
zimmer discusses the challenges of writing for the caped crusader and the tv theme for which he will be most remembered .
batman has a huge musical legacy - from the iconic na-na-na-na tv theme tune to danny elfman 's music in the tim burton films .
how do you approach writing the score with all that weight behind you ?
well , i think of the character differently .
one of the things i wanted to do on the first film was to write about a man who saw his parents get shot in front of his eyes .
what happens to him ?
what sort of strange psychology does that leave you with ?
you know , i can write long , big heroic tunes .
but i really felt that would be against the idea of what we wanted to do with this movie .
how much trial and error is there when you start writing ?
i usually know what i want to say right away - i just do n't know how to say it .
and it takes me the longest time to condense it and reduce it and shape it into something that takes my point of view and actually communicates it . "
this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ? "
hans zimmer on the temptation to rewrite the joker 's theme after heath ledger died whose idea was it for you to co-write the music with james newton howard ?
james and i are friends , so when chris -lsb- nolan , director -rsb- offered me batman begins , i asked him if we could write it together .
and he was absolutely into this idea because there is a duality to the character and it seemed to make sense .
there was n't a single piece in that score that was n't written by both of us .
is the same true for the dark knight ?
dark knight was different .
the joker and harvey dent were so singular that i felt you had to have a very strict and precise voice for both of them .
so james did harvey dent and i did the joker .
had you finished writing when heath ledger passed away ?
well , chris and i started talking about the joker in one way or the other before he had even finished the script .
i think i wrote all the joker material last july .
so that 's been quite a while .
when someone dies unexpectedly like that , it changes the way you look at their performance on the screen .
was there ever a temptation to go back and change the music too ?
there was one moment right at the beginning after he died .
we had one of those days where we thought : " oh my god , i ca n't do what i 'm doing .
i have to add some gravitas . "
but i realised quite suddenly that that would be the worst thing to do , because this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ?
so that 's obviously what we did .
because otherwise it would have been disingenuous and an insult to him .
you 've written for a lot of different genres of film - comedy , action , romance , cartoons .
do you enjoy the variety ?
that was the thing that bugged me so much about being in a rock band .
everyone expects you to do the same thing again and again .
i was interested in other forms of music - in classical , in electronic music , in rock and roll .
film lets you do that because you write in the style that you think is appropriate for that film .
is there one genre you 're better at ?
no , not really .
they 're all impossible when you start out on them .
what 's your composing environment like ?
oh , i have the craziest studio .
i have the batcave !
loads of synths … part of what was fun for me on the dark knight was dragging out all the old modular analogue synthesizers and making sounds from scratch .
i tortured people forever -lsb- by -rsb- making new drum sounds .
there 's a note for the joker that took me months to get .
i needed something that was ugly but at the same time completely confident and completely blasé .
so i had to completely wear out my cellist friend martin tillman .
you tortured him ?
it was n't so much torture .
but there was certainly some subterfuge going on .
despite all the awards and hollywood kudos , your most lasting composition for people of a certain age in the uk is the theme tune to going for gold .
are you aware of its impact ?
i knew that question was coming !
going for gold was a lot of fun .
it 's the sort of stuff you do when you do n't have a career yet .
god , i just felt so lucky because this thing paid my rent for the longest time .
i remember running into rod temperton once , who wrote thriller and all those michael jackson tracks , and he knew all the words !
does that make it a good piece of music ?
i do n't know .
i think most people know the words for it 's a small world after all as well - and i 'm not sure that 's a good thing .
hans zimmer was speaking to bbc news entertainment reporter mark savage .

by mark savage entertainment reporter , bbc news in the not-so-distant past , every summer blockbuster had to have its own chartbusting theme song .
bryan adams did everything he did for robin hood ; whitney houston would always love her bodyguard ; celine dion 's heart , she assured us , would go on , despite the sinking of the titanic .
but , musicals like mamma mia ! aside , recent blockbusters have been bereft of big-name ballads .
from x-men to pirates of the caribbean , there is n't a power chord in sight .
most striking of all is the complete absence of rock music in the rebooted batman franchise .
hans zimmer , who co-wrote the soundtrack for batman begins and the dark knight , says his vision of gotham city has no room for the likes of u2 , prince and r kelly .
" there was never any doubt that we were going to be songless , " says the oscar-winning composer .
" and , trust me , we were flooded with requests from every band in the world .
i actually had to say no to some really interesting people . "

even when a top 40 artist gets involved , they work in conjunction with the composer to create a song that is part of the fabric of the movie .
take , for example , annie lennox 's oscar-winning into the west , which runs over the closing credits to lord of the rings : return of the king .
co-written with the trilogy 's orchestral composer , howard shore , it was conceived as an elvish lament for those who have sailed across the sundering sea .
hardly top 40 material , then , but it complemented the film perfectly .
narnia composer harry gregson-williams says he prefers to work in this way - and recently collaborated with quirky new yorker regina spektor for the theme song to prince caspian .
" we always wanted a song for the end credits but there was no question of there ever being a song in the body of the film , " he says .
" regina came and spent two and a half weeks with me to make sure that the song felt like it belonged to this film .
" i think it 's a very pleasurable way to go . "
gregson-williams has experience of films being gatecrashed by towering rock songs , having worked on apocalyptic asteroid adventure armageddon , which was dominated by aerosmith 's i do n't want to miss a thing .
he says those sorts of bombastic anthems " have been left in the ' 90s " but notes that the last couple of years have seen the emergence of a new type of song-driven soundtrack .
a prime example is 2004 indie comedy garden state , which was underscored by a collection of achingly hip indie tracks from the likes of remy zero , coldplay and the shins .
' ton of money ' the album was compiled as a labour of love by director and star zach braff - better known as scrubs ' goofy dr john dorian .
it shifted an eye-opening 1.2 million copies in the us , and set a new trend in soundtracks , particularly on offbeat comedies such as juno and little miss sunshine .
alexandra patsavas , music supervisor on tv shows including the oc and grey 's anatomy plus several hollywood films , says the pick-and-mix approach serves directors better than shoehorning in a famous name .
" the song has to support the drama , " she says .
" so i 'm less focused on the big blockbuster than making sure every song fits . "
another advantage of using off-the-peg material by lesser-known bands is that it 's cost efficient .
" artists want a ton of money now , " kathy nelson , president of film music for universal pictures , told billboard magazine .
" i remember the days when i would spend $ 300,000 -lrb- £ 151,000 -rrb- for a soundtrack like pulp fiction and i thought the cost would put the label under .
now artists want $ 300,000 just to show up . "
the producers of spider-man 3 came up against this very problem when they decided to create an old-school blockbuster soundtrack last year .
" it cost a lot of money , " admits jordin tappis , president of record collection music , who compiled the album , and enlisted the help of irish rockers snow patrol to record the film 's big hit , signal fire .
" snow patrol are signed to polydor in the uk and interscope in america , " he explains .
" our label at the time went through warner bros records , and sony pictures has its own music division .
" so there were three giant , major media conglomerates fighting for a percentage of a pie .
" we had to split the profits of each sale .
nobody made a tonne of money , but everyone did well enough to make it a successful endeavour . "
" it was a mistake shoving all those prince songs into the first batman film " hans zimmer talking shop : hans zimmer tappis believes the financial woes of the music business are largely responsible for the fall-off in big movie themes .
" when album sales were at their peak you had a pretty good chance that , if the film did well and the song connected , you could sell a lot of copies , " he says .
" nowadays , you 're not selling as many records and the album becomes a souvenir .
people are n't willing to take the upfront risk as much as they used to . "
but maybe there 's a more pragmatic reason for shutting pop out of the cinema .
" however big a genius prince is , i do think it was a mistake shoving all those prince songs into the first batman film , " says zimmer .
" i remember thinking at the time , ' oooh , this is going to bite them ' and , yes , those songs really date the movie . "

take , for example , annie lennox 's oscar-winning into the west , which runs over the closing credits to lord of the rings : return of the king .
co-written with the trilogy 's orchestral composer , howard shore , it was conceived as an elvish lament for those who have sailed across the sundering sea .
hardly top 40 material , then , but it complemented the film perfectly .
narnia composer harry gregson-williams says he prefers to work in this way - and recently collaborated with quirky new yorker regina spektor for the theme song to prince caspian .
" we always wanted a song for the end credits but there was no question of there ever being a song in the body of the film , " he says .
" regina came and spent two and a half weeks with me to make sure that the song felt like it belonged to this film .
" i think it 's a very pleasurable way to go . "
gregson-williams credits include shrek , bridget jones and armageddon gregson-williams has experience of films being gatecrashed by towering rock songs , having worked on apocalyptic asteroid adventure armageddon , which was dominated by aerosmith 's i do n't want to miss a thing .
he says those sorts of bombastic anthems " have been left in the ' 90s " but notes that the last couple of years have seen the emergence of a new type of song-driven soundtrack .
a prime example is 2004 indie comedy garden state , which was underscored by a collection of achingly hip indie tracks from the likes of remy zero , coldplay and the shins .
' ton of money ' the album was compiled as a labour of love by director and star zach braff - better known as scrubs ' goofy dr john dorian .
it shifted an eye-opening 1.2 million copies in the us , and set a new trend in soundtracks , particularly on offbeat comedies such as juno and little miss sunshine .
alexandra patsavas , music supervisor on tv shows including the oc and grey 's anatomy plus several hollywood films , says the pick-and-mix approach serves directors better than shoehorning in a famous name .
" the song has to support the drama , " she says .
" so i 'm less focused on the big blockbuster than making sure every song fits . "
spider-man 3 bucked the trend with an original soundtrack album another advantage of using off-the-peg material by lesser-known bands is that it 's cost efficient .
" artists want a ton of money now , " kathy nelson , president of film music for universal pictures , told billboard magazine .
" i remember the days when i would spend $ 300,000 -lrb- £ 151,000 -rrb- for a soundtrack like pulp fiction and i thought the cost would put the label under .
now artists want $ 300,000 just to show up . "
the producers of spider-man 3 came up against this very problem when they decided to create an old-school blockbuster soundtrack last year .
" it cost a lot of money , " admits jordin tappis , president of record collection music , who compiled the album , and enlisted the help of irish rockers snow patrol to record the film 's big hit , signal fire .
" snow patrol are signed to polydor in the uk and interscope in america , " he explains .
" our label at the time went through warner bros records , and sony pictures has its own music division .
" so there were three giant , major media conglomerates fighting for a percentage of a pie .
" we had to split the profits of each sale .
nobody made a tonne of money , but everyone did well enough to make it a successful endeavour . "
it was a mistake shoving all those prince songs into the first batman film hans zimmer talking shop : hans zimmer tappis believes the financial woes of the music business are largely responsible for the fall-off in big movie themes .
" when album sales were at their peak you had a pretty good chance that , if the film did well and the song connected , you could sell a lot of copies , " he says .
" nowadays , you 're not selling as many records and the album becomes a souvenir .
people are n't willing to take the upfront risk as much as they used to . "
but maybe there 's a more pragmatic reason for shutting pop out of the cinema .
" however big a genius prince is , i do think it was a mistake shoving all those prince songs into the first batman film , " says zimmer .
" i remember thinking at the time , ' oooh , this is going to bite them ' and , yes , those songs really date the movie . "

by mark savage entertainment reporter , bbc news batman : the dark knight is the latest song-free blockbuster in the not-so-distant past , every summer blockbuster had to have its own chartbusting theme song .
bryan adams did everything he did for robin hood ; whitney houston would always love her bodyguard ; celine dion 's heart , she assured us , would go on , despite the sinking of the titanic .
but , musicals like mamma mia ! aside , recent blockbusters have been bereft of big-name ballads .
from x-men to pirates of the caribbean , there is n't a power chord in sight .
most striking of all is the complete absence of rock music in the rebooted batman franchise .
hans zimmer , who co-wrote the soundtrack for batman begins and the dark knight , says his vision of gotham city has no room for the likes of u2 , prince and r kelly .
" there was never any doubt that we were going to be songless , " says the oscar-winning composer .
" and , trust me , we were flooded with requests from every band in the world .
i actually had to say no to some really interesting people . "

the german-born musician got his big break playing keyboards on the buggles ' number one hit video killed the radio star , before making the leap into film under the tutelage of british musician stanley myers .
an oscar-winner for the lion king , he has recently finished work on batman : the dark knight , which he co-wrote with his friend james newton-howard .
zimmer discusses the challenges of writing for the caped crusader and the tv theme for which he will be most remembered .
batman has a huge musical legacy - from the iconic na-na-na-na tv theme tune to danny elfman 's music in the tim burton films .
how do you approach writing the score with all that weight behind you ?
well , i think of the character differently .
one of the things i wanted to do on the first film was to write about a man who saw his parents get shot in front of his eyes .
what happens to him ?
what sort of strange psychology does that leave you with ?
you know , i can write long , big heroic tunes .
but i really felt that would be against the idea of what we wanted to do with this movie .
how much trial and error is there when you start writing ?
i usually know what i want to say right away - i just do n't know how to say it .
and it takes me the longest time to condense it and reduce it and shape it into something that takes my point of view and actually communicates it .
this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ?
hans zimmer on the temptation to rewrite the joker 's theme after heath ledger died whose idea was it for you to co-write the music with james newton howard ?
james and i are friends , so when chris -lsb- nolan , director -rsb- offered me batman begins , i asked him if we could write it together .
and he was absolutely into this idea because there is a duality to the character and it seemed to make sense .
there was n't a single piece in that score that was n't written by both of us .
is the same true for the dark knight ?
dark knight was different .
the joker and harvey dent were so singular that i felt you had to have a very strict and precise voice for both of them .
so james did harvey dent and i did the joker .
had you finished writing when heath ledger passed away ?
well , chris and i started talking about the joker in one way or the other before he had even finished the script .
i think i wrote all the joker material last july .
so that 's been quite a while .
when someone dies unexpectedly like that , it changes the way you look at their performance on the screen .
was there ever a temptation to go back and change the music too ?
there was one moment right at the beginning after he died .
we had one of those days where we thought : " oh my god , i ca n't do what i 'm doing .
i have to add some gravitas . "
but i realised quite suddenly that that would be the worst thing to do , because this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ?
so that 's obviously what we did .
because otherwise it would have been disingenuous and an insult to him .
you 've written for a lot of different genres of film - comedy , action , romance , cartoons .
do you enjoy the variety ?
that was the thing that bugged me so much about being in a rock band .
everyone expects you to do the same thing again and again .
i was interested in other forms of music - in classical , in electronic music , in rock and roll .
film lets you do that because you write in the style that you think is appropriate for that film .
zimmer and james newton-howard -lrb- right -rrb- collaborated on batman is there one genre you 're better at ?
no , not really .
they 're all impossible when you start out on them .
what 's your composing environment like ?
oh , i have the craziest studio .
i have the batcave !
loads of synths … part of what was fun for me on the dark knight was dragging out all the old modular analogue synthesizers and making sounds from scratch .
i tortured people forever -lsb- by -rsb- making new drum sounds .

the german-born musician got his big break playing keyboards on the buggles ' number one hit video killed the radio star , before making the leap into film under the tutelage of british musician stanley myers .
an oscar-winner for the lion king , he has recently finished work on batman : the dark knight , which he co-wrote with his friend james newton-howard .
zimmer discusses the challenges of writing for the caped crusader and the tv theme for which he will be most remembered .
batman has a huge musical legacy - from the iconic na-na-na-na tv theme tune to danny elfman 's music in the tim burton films .
how do you approach writing the score with all that weight behind you ?
well , i think of the character differently .
one of the things i wanted to do on the first film was to write about a man who saw his parents get shot in front of his eyes .
what happens to him ?
what sort of strange psychology does that leave you with ?
you know , i can write long , big heroic tunes .
but i really felt that would be against the idea of what we wanted to do with this movie .
how much trial and error is there when you start writing ?
i usually know what i want to say right away - i just do n't know how to say it .
and it takes me the longest time to condense it and reduce it and shape it into something that takes my point of view and actually communicates it .
this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ?
hans zimmer on the temptation to rewrite the joker 's theme after heath ledger died whose idea was it for you to co-write the music with james newton howard ?
james and i are friends , so when chris -lsb- nolan , director -rsb- offered me batman begins , i asked him if we could write it together .
and he was absolutely into this idea because there is a duality to the character and it seemed to make sense .
there was n't a single piece in that score that was n't written by both of us .
is the same true for the dark knight ?
dark knight was different .
the joker and harvey dent were so singular that i felt you had to have a very strict and precise voice for both of them .
so james did harvey dent and i did the joker .
had you finished writing when heath ledger passed away ?
well , chris and i started talking about the joker in one way or the other before he had even finished the script .
i think i wrote all the joker material last july .
so that 's been quite a while .
when someone dies unexpectedly like that , it changes the way you look at their performance on the screen .
was there ever a temptation to go back and change the music too ?
there was one moment right at the beginning after he died .
we had one of those days where we thought : " oh my god , i ca n't do what i 'm doing .
i have to add some gravitas . "
but i realised quite suddenly that that would be the worst thing to do , because this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ?
so that 's obviously what we did .
because otherwise it would have been disingenuous and an insult to him .
you 've written for a lot of different genres of film - comedy , action , romance , cartoons .
do you enjoy the variety ?
that was the thing that bugged me so much about being in a rock band .
everyone expects you to do the same thing again and again .
i was interested in other forms of music - in classical , in electronic music , in rock and roll .
film lets you do that because you write in the style that you think is appropriate for that film .
zimmer and james newton-howard -lrb- right -rrb- collaborated on batman is there one genre you 're better at ?
no , not really .
they 're all impossible when you start out on them .
what 's your composing environment like ?
oh , i have the craziest studio .
i have the batcave !
loads of synths … part of what was fun for me on the dark knight was dragging out all the old modular analogue synthesizers and making sounds from scratch .
i tortured people forever -lsb- by -rsb- making new drum sounds .
there 's a note for the joker that took me months to get .
i needed something that was ugly but at the same time completely confident and completely blasé .
so i had to completely wear out my cellist friend martin tillman .
you tortured him ?
it was n't so much torture .
but there was certainly some subterfuge going on .
despite all the awards and hollywood kudos , your most lasting composition for people of a certain age in the uk is the theme tune to going for gold .

and he was absolutely into this idea because there is a duality to the character and it seemed to make sense .
there was n't a single piece in that score that was n't written by both of us .
is the same true for the dark knight ?
dark knight was different .
the joker and harvey dent were so singular that i felt you had to have a very strict and precise voice for both of them .
so james did harvey dent and i did the joker .
had you finished writing when heath ledger passed away ?
well , chris and i started talking about the joker in one way or the other before he had even finished the script .
i think i wrote all the joker material last july .
so that 's been quite a while .
when someone dies unexpectedly like that , it changes the way you look at their performance on the screen .
was there ever a temptation to go back and change the music too ?
there was one moment right at the beginning after he died .
we had one of those days where we thought : " oh my god , i ca n't do what i 'm doing .
i have to add some gravitas . "
but i realised quite suddenly that that would be the worst thing to do , because this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ?
so that 's obviously what we did .
because otherwise it would have been disingenuous and an insult to him .
you 've written for a lot of different genres of film - comedy , action , romance , cartoons .
do you enjoy the variety ?
that was the thing that bugged me so much about being in a rock band .
everyone expects you to do the same thing again and again .
i was interested in other forms of music - in classical , in electronic music , in rock and roll .
film lets you do that because you write in the style that you think is appropriate for that film .
zimmer and james newton-howard -lrb- right -rrb- collaborated on batman is there one genre you 're better at ?
no , not really .
they 're all impossible when you start out on them .
what 's your composing environment like ?
oh , i have the craziest studio .
i have the batcave !
loads of synths … part of what was fun for me on the dark knight was dragging out all the old modular analogue synthesizers and making sounds from scratch .
i tortured people forever -lsb- by -rsb- making new drum sounds .
there 's a note for the joker that took me months to get .
i needed something that was ugly but at the same time completely confident and completely blasé .
so i had to completely wear out my cellist friend martin tillman .
you tortured him ?
it was n't so much torture .
but there was certainly some subterfuge going on .
despite all the awards and hollywood kudos , your most lasting composition for people of a certain age in the uk is the theme tune to going for gold .
are you aware of its impact ?
i knew that question was coming !
going for gold was a lot of fun .
it 's the sort of stuff you do when you do n't have a career yet .
god , i just felt so lucky because this thing paid my rent for the longest time .
i remember running into rod temperton once , who wrote thriller and all those michael jackson tracks , and he knew all the words !
does that make it a good piece of music ?
i do n't know .
i think most people know the words for it 's a small world after all as well - and i 'm not sure that 's a good thing .

the german-born musician got his big break playing keyboards on the buggles ' number one hit video killed the radio star , before making the leap into film under the tutelage of british musician stanley myers .
an oscar-winner for the lion king , he has recently finished work on batman : the dark knight , which he co-wrote with his friend james newton-howard .
zimmer discusses the challenges of writing for the caped crusader and the tv theme for which he will be most remembered .
batman has a huge musical legacy - from the iconic na-na-na-na tv theme tune to danny elfman 's music in the tim burton films .
how do you approach writing the score with all that weight behind you ?
well , i think of the character differently .
one of the things i wanted to do on the first film was to write about a man who saw his parents get shot in front of his eyes .
what happens to him ?
what sort of strange psychology does that leave you with ?
you know , i can write long , big heroic tunes .
but i really felt that would be against the idea of what we wanted to do with this movie .
how much trial and error is there when you start writing ?
i usually know what i want to say right away - i just do n't know how to say it .
and it takes me the longest time to condense it and reduce it and shape it into something that takes my point of view and actually communicates it .
this guy worked so hard and he 's done such an incredible performance .
why would i go and wreck this performance now ?
hans zimmer on the temptation to rewrite the joker 's theme after heath ledger died whose idea was it for you to co-write the music with james newton howard ?

as the music supervisor on hit shows like the oc , grey 's anatomy and gossip girl , she reaches millions of television viewers every week , and has the power to make or break a band .
the oc , in particular , helped to push the killers , death cab for cutie and imogen heap into the limelight - and established artists like coldplay and beck soon started offering exclusive first plays of their material to the show .
patsavas explains how a typical show comes together - and lets us peek at the " recent tracks " playlist on her ipod .
how do you go about choosing what goes onto the soundtrack for a show ?
grey 's anatomy , for example , gets a compilation cd every couple of weeks filled with current music that i 've discussed with the executive producers and which they feel is great for the sound of the show .
sometimes we pitch for an edited scene and sometimes the writers fall in love with a song and write it into the first outline of the script .
which do you prefer ?
oh , both ways .
we use so much music that if a writer is inspired by a song and we can clear the rights , most often it works beautifully with the scene .
but sometimes it 's not exactly as the writer had envisioned and we pitch alternates .
the season finale of grey 's anatomy featured duffy , adele and coldplay how hard is it to suppress your own taste in music and choose the right song for a particular scene ?
you know , the great thing about this job is that you do n't have to be so straight and narrow .
i certainly have music that i love , but you begin to appreciate the best of every genre .
i 'm working on a show called mad men which takes place in the early 1960s , so most of the songs are from that period , which is a totally different way of listening to music .
do you get a shiver down your spine when you 're looking through those 1960s record collections and come across something rare or new ?
oh it 's definitely thrilling !
the part that can not be so thrilling is the challenging rights dance - making sure that this unknown gem is owned by someone or there 's a company that can license it .
sometimes , the writer ca n't be found - especially if it 's catalogue material - and there 's no way around that .
do you work hard to track down new bands ?
the film music business is well organised , so there are great companies that pitch music to supervisors like me but we also have individuals worldwide making blind submissions .
is there a big team of assistants sifting through the garbage to find the nugget of gold ?
you know what ?
there 's a lot of gold !
but definitely , they spend a lot of time listening .
the last five artists played on alex patsavas 's ipod anna ternheim secret machines anya marina the little ones ambulance ltd you seem to pick a lot of british acts for your shows - the kaiser chiefs , duffy , super furry animals , to name a few .
do you pay particular attention to the music scene over here ?
i grew up in the 1980s and my focus was definitely on the great music coming out of the uk at that point , so i think i have a special love for it .
but , with work , the important thing is not where music comes from , it 's more about where it fits .
is there pressure to make the music cool ?
i always thought summer roberts -lrb- rachel bilson 's socialite character in the oc -rrb- would have been more into christina aguilera than death cab for cutie .
josh schwartz wrote those characters to be in tune with pop culture .
seth -lrb- summer 's love interest -rrb- certainly loved his death cab and his indie rock .
summer was fashionable , but maybe she was hipster and she liked cool music .
anyway , we definitely had a few references to favourite songs from the 80s .
some journey , some boys ii men .
do you ever get to the point where you ca n't discern the good songs from the bad ?
you can always discern the bad !
you can get a little deaf after a while and it becomes hard to hear good .
but the bad always , always sticks out .
would you say there are similarities between you and the guys in high fidelity ?
-lsb- laughs -rsb- i have more friends and relatives !
i 'm more a part of my social world .
but i am fanatical about music , just like those characters .

as the music supervisor on hit shows like the oc , grey 's anatomy and gossip girl , she reaches millions of television viewers every week , and has the power to make or break a band .
the oc , in particular , helped to push the killers , death cab for cutie and imogen heap into the limelight - and established artists like coldplay and beck soon started offering exclusive first plays of their material to the show .
patsavas explains how a typical show comes together - and lets us peek at the " recent tracks " playlist on her ipod .
how do you go about choosing what goes onto the soundtrack for a show ?
grey 's anatomy , for example , gets a compilation cd every couple of weeks filled with current music that i 've discussed with the executive producers and which they feel is great for the sound of the show .
sometimes we pitch for an edited scene and sometimes the writers fall in love with a song and write it into the first outline of the script .
which do you prefer ?
oh , both ways .
we use so much music that if a writer is inspired by a song and we can clear the rights , most often it works beautifully with the scene .
but sometimes it 's not exactly as the writer had envisioned and we pitch alternates .
the season finale of grey 's anatomy featured duffy , adele and coldplay how hard is it to suppress your own taste in music and choose the right song for a particular scene ?
you know , the great thing about this job is that you do n't have to be so straight and narrow .
i certainly have music that i love , but you begin to appreciate the best of every genre .
i 'm working on a show called mad men which takes place in the early 1960s , so most of the songs are from that period , which is a totally different way of listening to music .
do you get a shiver down your spine when you 're looking through those 1960s record collections and come across something rare or new ?
oh it 's definitely thrilling !

by mark savage entertainment reporter , bbc news batman : the dark knight is the latest song-free blockbuster in the not-so-distant past , every summer blockbuster had to have its own chartbusting theme song .
bryan adams did everything he did for robin hood ; whitney houston would always love her bodyguard ; celine dion 's heart , she assured us , would go on , despite the sinking of the titanic .
but , musicals like mamma mia ! aside , recent blockbusters have been bereft of big-name ballads .
from x-men to pirates of the caribbean , there is n't a power chord in sight .
most striking of all is the complete absence of rock music in the rebooted batman franchise .
hans zimmer , who co-wrote the soundtrack for batman begins and the dark knight , says his vision of gotham city has no room for the likes of u2 , prince and r kelly .
" there was never any doubt that we were going to be songless , " says the oscar-winning composer .
" and , trust me , we were flooded with requests from every band in the world .
i actually had to say no to some really interesting people . "
uk 's best-selling movie themes john travolta and olivia newton-john - you 're the one that i want -lrb- 1.98m sales -rrb- wet wet wet - love is all around -lrb- 1.79m -rrb- stevie wonder - i just called to say i love you -lrb- 1.78m -rrb- bryan adams - everything i do -lrb- i do it for you -rrb- -lrb- 1.55m -rrb- john travolta and olivia newton-john - summer nights -lrb- 1.52m -rrb- whitney houston - i will always love you -lrb- 1.36m -rrb- celine dion - my heart will go on -lrb- 1.35m -rrb- pictured coolio - gangsta 's paradise -lrb- 1.25m -rrb- art garfunkel - bright eyes -lrb- 1.16m -rrb- source : everyhit.com talking shop : music supervisor alex patsavas zimmer 's decision , taken in collaboration with director chris nolan and co-composer james newton-howard , reflects a sea-change in the way film-makers approach soundtracks .
even when a top 40 artist gets involved , they work in conjunction with the composer to create a song that is part of the fabric of the movie .
take , for example , annie lennox 's oscar-winning into the west , which runs over the closing credits to lord of the rings : return of the king .
co-written with the trilogy 's orchestral composer , howard shore , it was conceived as an elvish lament for those who have sailed across the sundering sea .
hardly top 40 material , then , but it complemented the film perfectly .
narnia composer harry gregson-williams says he prefers to work in this way - and recently collaborated with quirky new yorker regina spektor for the theme song to prince caspian .
" we always wanted a song for the end credits but there was no question of there ever being a song in the body of the film , " he says .
" regina came and spent two and a half weeks with me to make sure that the song felt like it belonged to this film .
" i think it 's a very pleasurable way to go . "
gregson-williams credits include shrek , bridget jones and armageddon gregson-williams has experience of films being gatecrashed by towering rock songs , having worked on apocalyptic asteroid adventure armageddon , which was dominated by aerosmith 's i do n't want to miss a thing .
he says those sorts of bombastic anthems " have been left in the ' 90s " but notes that the last couple of years have seen the emergence of a new type of song-driven soundtrack .
a prime example is 2004 indie comedy garden state , which was underscored by a collection of achingly hip indie tracks from the likes of remy zero , coldplay and the shins .
' ton of money ' the album was compiled as a labour of love by director and star zach braff - better known as scrubs ' goofy dr john dorian .
it shifted an eye-opening 1.2 million copies in the us , and set a new trend in soundtracks , particularly on offbeat comedies such as juno and little miss sunshine .
alexandra patsavas , music supervisor on tv shows including the oc and grey 's anatomy plus several hollywood films , says the pick-and-mix approach serves directors better than shoehorning in a famous name .
" the song has to support the drama , " she says .
" so i 'm less focused on the big blockbuster than making sure every song fits . "
spider-man 3 bucked the trend with an original soundtrack album another advantage of using off-the-peg material by lesser-known bands is that it 's cost efficient .
" artists want a ton of money now , " kathy nelson , president of film music for universal pictures , told billboard magazine .
" i remember the days when i would spend $ 300,000 -lrb- £ 151,000 -rrb- for a soundtrack like pulp fiction and i thought the cost would put the label under .
now artists want $ 300,000 just to show up . "
the producers of spider-man 3 came up against this very problem when they decided to create an old-school blockbuster soundtrack last year .
" it cost a lot of money , " admits jordin tappis , president of record collection music , who compiled the album , and enlisted the help of irish rockers snow patrol to record the film 's big hit , signal fire .
" snow patrol are signed to polydor in the uk and interscope in america , " he explains .
" our label at the time went through warner bros records , and sony pictures has its own music division .
" so there were three giant , major media conglomerates fighting for a percentage of a pie .
" we had to split the profits of each sale .
nobody made a tonne of money , but everyone did well enough to make it a successful endeavour . "
it was a mistake shoving all those prince songs into the first batman film hans zimmer talking shop : hans zimmer tappis believes the financial woes of the music business are largely responsible for the fall-off in big movie themes .
" when album sales were at their peak you had a pretty good chance that , if the film did well and the song connected , you could sell a lot of copies , " he says .
" nowadays , you 're not selling as many records and the album becomes a souvenir .
people are n't willing to take the upfront risk as much as they used to . "
but maybe there 's a more pragmatic reason for shutting pop out of the cinema .
" however big a genius prince is , i do think it was a mistake shoving all those prince songs into the first batman film , " says zimmer .
" i remember thinking at the time , ' oooh , this is going to bite them ' and , yes , those songs really date the movie . "
