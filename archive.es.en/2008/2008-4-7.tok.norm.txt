despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 deutsche telekom faces massive lawsuit by shareholders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's famed pink " t " logo is in disarray deutsche telekom is the dock from monday in a landmark lawsuit filed by 16,000 shareholders who feel cheated by the former public phone company and are suing the telecoms giant for up to 80 million euros -lrb- $ 126 million -rrb- . in a case closely watched by the corporate world , deutsche telekom faces a massive lawsuit brought by more than 800 law firms representing thousands of telekom shareholders who say the company inflated the value of its real estate holdings and misled them .
the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .
" lawmakers wanted to ensure that it 's not 17,000 plaintiffs suing a company en masse , but rather that a model case clears up the fundamental questions in a higher court , " shares expert ruediger von rosen told german news agency dpa .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .
" lawmakers wanted to ensure that it 's not 17,000 plaintiffs suing a company en masse , but rather that a model case clears up the fundamental questions in a higher court , " shares expert ruediger von rosen told german news agency dpa .
the case is expected to drag on for years .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .

black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .

telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .
" lawmakers wanted to ensure that it 's not 17,000 plaintiffs suing a company en masse , but rather that a model case clears up the fundamental questions in a higher court , " shares expert ruediger von rosen told german news agency dpa .
the case is expected to drag on for years .

" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .

the case is expected to drag on for years .
seventeen court hearings are expected between monday and the end of may .
a second case of its kind is already being prepared as shareholders plan to sue over alleged irregularities in the listing of deutsche telekom capital in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's head is determined not to let his members be silenced verdi 's bsirske has called upon the family-owned firm to take responsibility for the covert sponsoring of aub or take action against those responsible in the company management .
he said that aldi 's use of such methods to " suppress union work " raised questions about the integrity of those at the top of the company . the company said that until aub head schelsky 's arrest last year that it had regarded him as the legitimate chairman of aub .
it stressed that it had not been trying to hamper the work of aldi nord 's works councils .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , tiefensee released a report entitled " east germany as a place for direct indian investment , " compiled by accounting house kpmg . " promoting investment in india is worth the effort , " the minister told journalists .
" the indian economy is booming and germany 's eastern states are appearing increasingly attractive to indian companies , " said tiefensee . india 's growing investment industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renewable energies have helped boost economies in india and eastern germany while it may seem strange to outsiders that a developed nation like germany would be looking for investment from a developing country , authors of the report paint a difference picture . " while india has been developing into a key destination for foreign investment , foreign direct investment by indian companies already overtook investment flowing into india in 2007 , " the report said . tiefensee agreed .
" indian investors , who are interested in the european market , have given priority to industry branches which eastern germany offers particular advantages as a place to invest . " this includes the it sector as well as the chemical industry along with the automotive sector and mechanical engineering industries . it also includes the booming renewable energy sector , which has grown exponentially in eastern germany over the last decade " these are the industries of the future , " tiefensee said .
an ideal dynamic for investment eastern germany 's location between western and eastern europe likewise makes it an ideal place for foreign investors to gain a foothold on the european market .
apart from a recently built ultra-modern infrastructure , the area also comes with a state investment aid program . " we are using this dynamic to help win investors for east germany , " tiefensee , who is also the german minister responsible for overseeing the development of eastern germany , said .
the time looks to be ripe for foreign investment in the former communist east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german cities like dresden could get a boost from indian investors now all that 's left is finding the right investors .
essentially , this involves drawing up a clear and comprehensive presentation to help indian companies see eastern germany as an ideal place to invest , according to the report . and tiefensee seems to agree .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 deutsche telekom faces massive lawsuit by shareholders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's famed pink " t " logo is in disarray deutsche telekom is the dock from monday in a landmark lawsuit filed by 16,000 shareholders who feel cheated by the former public phone company and are suing the telecoms giant for up to 80 million euros -lrb- $ 126 million -rrb- . in a case closely watched by the corporate world , deutsche telekom faces a massive lawsuit brought by more than 800 law firms representing thousands of telekom shareholders who say the company inflated the value of its real estate holdings and misled them .
the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .
" lawmakers wanted to ensure that it 's not 17,000 plaintiffs suing a company en masse , but rather that a model case clears up the fundamental questions in a higher court , " shares expert ruediger von rosen told german news agency dpa .
the case is expected to drag on for years .
seventeen court hearings are expected between monday and the end of may .
a second case of its kind is already being prepared as shareholders plan to sue over alleged irregularities in the listing of deutsche telekom capital in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .
" lawmakers wanted to ensure that it 's not 17,000 plaintiffs suing a company en masse , but rather that a model case clears up the fundamental questions in a higher court , " shares expert ruediger von rosen told german news agency dpa .
the case is expected to drag on for years .
seventeen court hearings are expected between monday and the end of may .
a second case of its kind is already being prepared as shareholders plan to sue over alleged irregularities in the listing of deutsche telekom capital in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .

"
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .

but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" while india has been developing into a key destination for foreign investment , foreign direct investment by indian companies already overtook investment flowing into india in 2007 , " the report said . tiefensee agreed .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .

but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .

shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .

they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 europe approves use of mobile phones on aircraft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skies above europe may soon be alive with the sound of ringtones airlines in germany have reacted coolly to approval by the european commission on monday of technology allowing air passengers to text and make calls on their mobile phones in mid-air . the european commision on monday , april 7 , cleared the way for airlines to introduce technology that would allow passengers to use their mobile phones in mid-air , but leading carriers in germany said they would not be offering the service .
the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week , tiefensee released a report entitled " east germany as a place for direct indian investment , " compiled by accounting house kpmg . " promoting investment in india is worth the effort , " the minister told journalists .
" the indian economy is booming and germany 's eastern states are appearing increasingly attractive to indian companies , " said tiefensee . india 's growing investment industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renewable energies have helped boost economies in india and eastern germany while it may seem strange to outsiders that a developed nation like germany would be looking for investment from a developing country , authors of the report paint a difference picture . " while india has been developing into a key destination for foreign investment , foreign direct investment by indian companies already overtook investment flowing into india in 2007 , " the report said . tiefensee agreed .
" indian investors , who are interested in the european market , have given priority to industry branches which eastern germany offers particular advantages as a place to invest . " this includes the it sector as well as the chemical industry along with the automotive sector and mechanical engineering industries . it also includes the booming renewable energy sector , which has grown exponentially in eastern germany over the last decade " these are the industries of the future , " tiefensee said .
an ideal dynamic for investment eastern germany 's location between western and eastern europe likewise makes it an ideal place for foreign investors to gain a foothold on the european market .
apart from a recently built ultra-modern infrastructure , the area also comes with a state investment aid program . " we are using this dynamic to help win investors for east germany , " tiefensee , who is also the german minister responsible for overseeing the development of eastern germany , said .
the time looks to be ripe for foreign investment in the former communist east .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .
and the head of the bundestag 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , said the dosb had sent a " precipitous and false signal " from germany .
he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .
bach : " the world is full of war " bach maintains that athletes can speak their minds during the games , but added that a sports contest should not be " weighed down " by political demonstrations .
" there are around 50 wars going on right now in the world , " he told dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 07.04.2008 supermarket chain aldi accused of trying to buy union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has been accused of shady dealings germany 's biggest public sector union has announced it will sue supermarket chain aldi over allegations that it secretly financed a rival union in order to create a tame alternative to verdi . for decades , aldi nord , the company 's northern german branch , illegally financed aub , a small union which is considered more employer friendly , according to a report in germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's head is determined not to let his members be silenced verdi 's bsirske has called upon the family-owned firm to take responsibility for the covert sponsoring of aub or take action against those responsible in the company management .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics olympics -pipe- 07.04.2008 olympic torch relay cut short amid protests in paris großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay was hampered by hundreds of protestors in downtown paris a relay of the olympic torch through paris was canceled on monday and the flame was put on a bus at the request of chinese officials after pro-tibetan protesters repeatedly disrupted its progress . chinese authorities decided to scratch the torch relay after human rights activists and pro-tibet protests disrupted the passage of the flame in the french capital , forcing security officials to partly speed the flame through the streets of paris in a bus .
despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .

but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .
" lawmakers wanted to ensure that it 's not 17,000 plaintiffs suing a company en masse , but rather that a model case clears up the fundamental questions in a higher court , " shares expert ruediger von rosen told german news agency dpa .
the case is expected to drag on for years .
seventeen court hearings are expected between monday and the end of may .
a second case of its kind is already being prepared as shareholders plan to sue over alleged irregularities in the listing of deutsche telekom capital in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .

but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .

but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .

he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .
bach : " the world is full of war " bach maintains that athletes can speak their minds during the games , but added that a sports contest should not be " weighed down " by political demonstrations .
" there are around 50 wars going on right now in the world , " he told dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 07.04.2008 german olympics official defends no-boycott stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan protesters have accompanied the beijing games from the get-go a top german olympics official has come under increasing fire for his early and absolute stance opposing a boycott of the games .
however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .
and the head of the bundestag 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , said the dosb had sent a " precipitous and false signal " from germany .
he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .
bach : " the world is full of war " bach maintains that athletes can speak their minds during the games , but added that a sports contest should not be " weighed down " by political demonstrations .
" there are around 50 wars going on right now in the world , " he told dpa .
" if every one of those countries wanted to have a political demonstration then the games would be overloaded . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .

kfw currently owns roughly 43 percent of ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business that ran into trouble after investing heavily in securities backed in part by high-risk us mortgages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid matthäus-maier kfw board member juergen koppelin told dpa that the ikb would need an additional 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in bailout money , on top of the 8.5 billion euros it has already received .
the ikb has been badly hit by its speculative trading in the us subprime mortgage market and has had to be bailed out repeatedly .
the kfw has stumped up 6 billion euros so far .
the ikb is mainly involved in providing long-term finance for medium-sized german companies .
the kfw was set up after world war ii as a state-backed financial institution aimed at providing funds for rebuilding the german economy .
it had long been rumored that matthaeus-maier 's contract would not be renewed when it came up for renewal next year . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 europe approves use of mobile phones on aircraft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skies above europe may soon be alive with the sound of ringtones airlines in germany have reacted coolly to approval by the european commission on monday of technology allowing air passengers to text and make calls on their mobile phones in mid-air . the european commision on monday , april 7 , cleared the way for airlines to introduce technology that would allow passengers to use their mobile phones in mid-air , but leading carriers in germany said they would not be offering the service .
the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 europe approves use of mobile phones on aircraft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skies above europe may soon be alive with the sound of ringtones airlines in germany have reacted coolly to approval by the european commission on monday of technology allowing air passengers to text and make calls on their mobile phones in mid-air . the european commision on monday , april 7 , cleared the way for airlines to introduce technology that would allow passengers to use their mobile phones in mid-air , but leading carriers in germany said they would not be offering the service .
the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's head is determined not to let his members be silenced verdi 's bsirske has called upon the family-owned firm to take responsibility for the covert sponsoring of aub or take action against those responsible in the company management .
he said that aldi 's use of such methods to " suppress union work " raised questions about the integrity of those at the top of the company . the company said that until aub head schelsky 's arrest last year that it had regarded him as the legitimate chairman of aub .
it stressed that it had not been trying to hamper the work of aldi nord 's works councils .
aldi said works council members at aldi nord had depicted aub and schelsky as a " trustworthy alternative " to verdi .
observers see the recent scandals as an assault on the principle of co-determination , a central pillar of german labor relations and the country 's social market economy .
works council representatives are elected by all employees in a firm and their agreement is needed for a range of important decisions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 07.04.2008 supermarket chain aldi accused of trying to buy union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has been accused of shady dealings germany 's biggest public sector union has announced it will sue supermarket chain aldi over allegations that it secretly financed a rival union in order to create a tame alternative to verdi . for decades , aldi nord , the company 's northern german branch , illegally financed aub , a small union which is considered more employer friendly , according to a report in germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's head is determined not to let his members be silenced verdi 's bsirske has called upon the family-owned firm to take responsibility for the covert sponsoring of aub or take action against those responsible in the company management .
he said that aldi 's use of such methods to " suppress union work " raised questions about the integrity of those at the top of the company . the company said that until aub head schelsky 's arrest last year that it had regarded him as the legitimate chairman of aub .
it stressed that it had not been trying to hamper the work of aldi nord 's works councils .
aldi said works council members at aldi nord had depicted aub and schelsky as a " trustworthy alternative " to verdi .
observers see the recent scandals as an assault on the principle of co-determination , a central pillar of german labor relations and the country 's social market economy .
works council representatives are elected by all employees in a firm and their agreement is needed for a range of important decisions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kfw currently owns roughly 43 percent of ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business that ran into trouble after investing heavily in securities backed in part by high-risk us mortgages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid matthäus-maier kfw board member juergen koppelin told dpa that the ikb would need an additional 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in bailout money , on top of the 8.5 billion euros it has already received .
the ikb has been badly hit by its speculative trading in the us subprime mortgage market and has had to be bailed out repeatedly .
the kfw has stumped up 6 billion euros so far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 europe approves use of mobile phones on aircraft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skies above europe may soon be alive with the sound of ringtones airlines in germany have reacted coolly to approval by the european commission on monday of technology allowing air passengers to text and make calls on their mobile phones in mid-air . the european commision on monday , april 7 , cleared the way for airlines to introduce technology that would allow passengers to use their mobile phones in mid-air , but leading carriers in germany said they would not be offering the service .
the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .

shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .

he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .

verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's head is determined not to let his members be silenced verdi 's bsirske has called upon the family-owned firm to take responsibility for the covert sponsoring of aub or take action against those responsible in the company management .
he said that aldi 's use of such methods to " suppress union work " raised questions about the integrity of those at the top of the company . the company said that until aub head schelsky 's arrest last year that it had regarded him as the legitimate chairman of aub .
it stressed that it had not been trying to hamper the work of aldi nord 's works councils .
aldi said works council members at aldi nord had depicted aub and schelsky as a " trustworthy alternative " to verdi .
observers see the recent scandals as an assault on the principle of co-determination , a central pillar of german labor relations and the country 's social market economy .

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kfw currently owns roughly 43 percent of ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business that ran into trouble after investing heavily in securities backed in part by high-risk us mortgages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid matthäus-maier kfw board member juergen koppelin told dpa that the ikb would need an additional 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in bailout money , on top of the 8.5 billion euros it has already received .
the ikb has been badly hit by its speculative trading in the us subprime mortgage market and has had to be bailed out repeatedly .
the kfw has stumped up 6 billion euros so far .
the ikb is mainly involved in providing long-term finance for medium-sized german companies .
the kfw was set up after world war ii as a state-backed financial institution aimed at providing funds for rebuilding the german economy .

last week , tiefensee released a report entitled " east germany as a place for direct indian investment , " compiled by accounting house kpmg . " promoting investment in india is worth the effort , " the minister told journalists .
" the indian economy is booming and germany 's eastern states are appearing increasingly attractive to indian companies , " said tiefensee . india 's growing investment industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renewable energies have helped boost economies in india and eastern germany while it may seem strange to outsiders that a developed nation like germany would be looking for investment from a developing country , authors of the report paint a difference picture . " while india has been developing into a key destination for foreign investment , foreign direct investment by indian companies already overtook investment flowing into india in 2007 , " the report said . tiefensee agreed .
" indian investors , who are interested in the european market , have given priority to industry branches which eastern germany offers particular advantages as a place to invest . " this includes the it sector as well as the chemical industry along with the automotive sector and mechanical engineering industries . it also includes the booming renewable energy sector , which has grown exponentially in eastern germany over the last decade " these are the industries of the future , " tiefensee said .
an ideal dynamic for investment eastern germany 's location between western and eastern europe likewise makes it an ideal place for foreign investors to gain a foothold on the european market .
apart from a recently built ultra-modern infrastructure , the area also comes with a state investment aid program . " we are using this dynamic to help win investors for east germany , " tiefensee , who is also the german minister responsible for overseeing the development of eastern germany , said .
the time looks to be ripe for foreign investment in the former communist east .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern german cities like dresden could get a boost from indian investors now all that 's left is finding the right investors .
essentially , this involves drawing up a clear and comprehensive presentation to help indian companies see eastern germany as an ideal place to invest , according to the report . and tiefensee seems to agree .

verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .

he said that aldi 's use of such methods to " suppress union work " raised questions about the integrity of those at the top of the company . the company said that until aub head schelsky 's arrest last year that it had regarded him as the legitimate chairman of aub .
it stressed that it had not been trying to hamper the work of aldi nord 's works councils .
aldi said works council members at aldi nord had depicted aub and schelsky as a " trustworthy alternative " to verdi .

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kfw currently owns roughly 43 percent of ikb , a specialist in loans to small- and medium-sized business that ran into trouble after investing heavily in securities backed in part by high-risk us mortgages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingrid matthäus-maier kfw board member juergen koppelin told dpa that the ikb would need an additional 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in bailout money , on top of the 8.5 billion euros it has already received .
the ikb has been badly hit by its speculative trading in the us subprime mortgage market and has had to be bailed out repeatedly .
the kfw has stumped up 6 billion euros so far .
the ikb is mainly involved in providing long-term finance for medium-sized german companies .
the kfw was set up after world war ii as a state-backed financial institution aimed at providing funds for rebuilding the german economy .

british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .

in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's head is determined not to let his members be silenced verdi 's bsirske has called upon the family-owned firm to take responsibility for the covert sponsoring of aub or take action against those responsible in the company management .
he said that aldi 's use of such methods to " suppress union work " raised questions about the integrity of those at the top of the company . the company said that until aub head schelsky 's arrest last year that it had regarded him as the legitimate chairman of aub .
it stressed that it had not been trying to hamper the work of aldi nord 's works councils .
aldi said works council members at aldi nord had depicted aub and schelsky as a " trustworthy alternative " to verdi .
observers see the recent scandals as an assault on the principle of co-determination , a central pillar of german labor relations and the country 's social market economy .
works council representatives are elected by all employees in a firm and their agreement is needed for a range of important decisions . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .
and the head of the bundestag 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , said the dosb had sent a " precipitous and false signal " from germany .
he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .
bach : " the world is full of war " bach maintains that athletes can speak their minds during the games , but added that a sports contest should not be " weighed down " by political demonstrations .
" there are around 50 wars going on right now in the world , " he told dpa .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 deutsche telekom faces massive lawsuit by shareholders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's famed pink " t " logo is in disarray deutsche telekom is the dock from monday in a landmark lawsuit filed by 16,000 shareholders who feel cheated by the former public phone company and are suing the telecoms giant for up to 80 million euros -lrb- $ 126 million -rrb- . in a case closely watched by the corporate world , deutsche telekom faces a massive lawsuit brought by more than 800 law firms representing thousands of telekom shareholders who say the company inflated the value of its real estate holdings and misled them .
the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .
" lawmakers wanted to ensure that it 's not 17,000 plaintiffs suing a company en masse , but rather that a model case clears up the fundamental questions in a higher court , " shares expert ruediger von rosen told german news agency dpa .
the case is expected to drag on for years .
seventeen court hearings are expected between monday and the end of may .
a second case of its kind is already being prepared as shareholders plan to sue over alleged irregularities in the listing of deutsche telekom capital in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .
and the head of the bundestag 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , said the dosb had sent a " precipitous and false signal " from germany .
he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .
bach : " the world is full of war " bach maintains that athletes can speak their minds during the games , but added that a sports contest should not be " weighed down " by political demonstrations .
" there are around 50 wars going on right now in the world , " he told dpa .

however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .

he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .
bach : " the world is full of war " bach maintains that athletes can speak their minds during the games , but added that a sports contest should not be " weighed down " by political demonstrations .

verdi head frank bsirske said aldi broke the law that prohibits any attempt to influence the works council elections or manipulate the councils in any other way .
the budget supermarket chain is the latest german company to become entangled in a corruption scandal that has also engulfed the engineering giant siemens and the postal company pin .
siemens is similarly accused of financing aub , while pin allegedly made illegal payments to the postal union gnbz .
covert payments to disgraced union boss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the discount chain is the latest firm accused of anti-union activities aldi nord reportedly covertly transferred money via a legal firm to the account of the former head of aub , wilhelm schelsky , who is currently in custody awaiting trial in connection with the siemens affair .
schelsky is accused of having received some 50 million euros -lrb- $ 78 million -rrb- from siemens managers in return for establishing a pliant counterweight to the engineering union ig metall .
the discount grocery chain told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it did pay 120,000 euros for an aub member to train aldi works council members , but denied any wrongdoing .
" we did not make the payments directly in order to avoid creating the impression that we wanted to influence the training , " aldi stated . the company added that this had not been the case and emphasized that its actions had been legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verdi 's head is determined not to let his members be silenced verdi 's bsirske has called upon the family-owned firm to take responsibility for the covert sponsoring of aub or take action against those responsible in the company management .
he said that aldi 's use of such methods to " suppress union work " raised questions about the integrity of those at the top of the company . the company said that until aub head schelsky 's arrest last year that it had regarded him as the legitimate chairman of aub .
it stressed that it had not been trying to hamper the work of aldi nord 's works councils .
aldi said works council members at aldi nord had depicted aub and schelsky as a " trustworthy alternative " to verdi .
observers see the recent scandals as an assault on the principle of co-determination , a central pillar of german labor relations and the country 's social market economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 europe approves use of mobile phones on aircraft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the skies above europe may soon be alive with the sound of ringtones airlines in germany have reacted coolly to approval by the european commission on monday of technology allowing air passengers to text and make calls on their mobile phones in mid-air . the european commision on monday , april 7 , cleared the way for airlines to introduce technology that would allow passengers to use their mobile phones in mid-air , but leading carriers in germany said they would not be offering the service .
the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .

the aim of the eu is to create a pan-european framework for mobile communications on aircraft , so passengers can make and receive calls , text messages and use e-mail with their own cell phones .
calls will still be banned during take-off and landing and allowed only once a plane reached 3,000 meters in altitude .
" people do n't want to be disturbed " two of germany 's biggest airlines , lufthansa and air berlin , said monday they were n't in favor of the new in-flight service .
jan baerwalde , spokesman for lufthansa , said a poll had revealed that passengers rejected the facility and that the airline had no plans to introduce mobile capability .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone would like to be party to fellow passengers ' conversations " people do n't want to be disturbed , " he told german news agency dpa , adding that lufthansa instead planned to expand on its existing on-board broad-band internet capacity .
a spokeswoman for air berlin , germany 's second largest airline , also ruled out mid-air mobile phone calls .
" it would be seen as a disturbance , " alexandra mueller said .
" there would be an impossible ringing on board . "
british airways too was reserved in its reaction to the new eu plans , with a spokeswoman suggesting it " could devalue the travel experience . "
this , indeed , is a concern shared by many .
in a bus or train , you can at least usually move to a quieter spot , if you want to escape a noisy neighbor .
in the air , you could be trapped for hours , forced to endure the painful sound of private lives being made public : a truly nightmarish scenario .
in the united states , aviation authorities have ruled out the use of mobile phones on planes .
there resistance is chiefly born out of fears that it could interfere with the controls of a plane .
standardized technology across the eu other airlines however were much more upbeat about the new mobile capability . air france , ryanair and bmi are already holding trials or have plans to make an in-flight phone service available .
outside europe , emirates last month became the first airline to enable mobile voice services on flights .
under the european system , passengers ' phone calls would go through an on-board cellular network linked to the ground via satellite , allowing mobiles to transmit less powerfully and avoid possible interference .
the system will simultaneously prevent phones from connecting directly with base stations on the ground below .
the european commission backing means planes registered in one eu country would be able to offer mobile communications services to passengers when flying over other eu countries without having to apply for additional national licences .
the eu 's 27 member states have six months to comply with the new rules .
mid-air calls could be pricey viviane reding , the eu 's telecommunications commissioner , welcomed the advantages of the move .
but at the same time , she warned operators to keep the cost of calls made on aircraft at a reasonable level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it might be easier on the wallet to make calls on the ground rather than in mid-air " in-flight mobile phone services can be a very interesting new service especially for those business travellers who need to be ready to communicate wherever they are , wherever they go , " she said in a statement .
" however , if consumers receive shock phone bills , the service will not take off , " reding said . " i also call on airlines and operators to create the right conditions on board aircraft to ensure that those who want to use in-flight communication services do not disturb other passengers , " she added . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .

rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .
" we respect the autonomous decision of politics just like we expect from politics to respect the decisions of sports organizations , " he said .
another ioc member , who spoke anonymously to dpa , was n't as diplomatic as bach in his frustration about sarkozy and other politicians .
" i think that all this issue about a boycott is politicians misusing the games .
why does n't sarkozy boycott the french businesses with china , agreements he finalized while he was talking about human rights ? " the olympian said .
according to bach , those who focus on the politics of the nation hosting the olympics are missing the main point .
" the discussion is about the role of sport on these issues , which role sport can play .
here it must use its strength , and the strength of sport is indeed to bring all 205 countries of the world together at one place for peaceful competition , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .

" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .

despite a heavy police escort , organizers had to twice extinguish the flame briefly after hundreds of pro-tibet activists disrupted its progress .
earlier , the chinese cancelled a planned reception for the torch at paris city hall at the last minute after a banner supporting human rights was hung from the facade of the building , mayor bernard delanoe told reporters .
" the chinese officials decided they would not stop here because they were put out by parisian citizens expressing their support for human rights .
it is their responsibility , " he said .
black flag at the eiffel a day earlier , the torch relay was met with widespread protests in london where scuffles broke out between police and activists , leading to close to 40 arrests , before the lit torch eventually reached its goal .
on monday , french athlete stephane diagana led the planned relay of 80 runners chosen to carry the flame through the paris streets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security men tackle a protestor as french athlete stephane diagana carries the torch the torch was protected by a phalanx of motorcycle police , jogging firemen , police on roller blades and dozens of riot police vehicles , afp news service reported .
but it had barely progressed more than 200 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- before it was put aboard a bus to prevent any attempt to extinguish the flame .
shortly after the trek began , media rights activists flew a black flag with the five olympic rings turned into handcuffs from the eiffel tower .
three members of the reporters without borders -lrb- rsf -rrb- group - which disrupted the lighting of the flame in athens - evaded security measures to climb up inside the steel tower and unfurl the four-metre -lrb- 13 foot -rrb- flag .
they then handcuffed themselves to the structure , more than 75 meters above ground , hampering the work of firefighters sent to remove them .
rogge raises pressure on beijing the olympic flame - also called the olympic light and the olympic eye - is lit at olympia , greece , and carried in a relay to the spectacular opening ceremony at the games themselves . the origins of the flame ceremony lie in ancient greece , but the idea of marking the opening of the games with a relay goes back to the 1936 berlin olympics .
even before the paris run began , international olympic committee president jacques rogge called on china monday to peacefully end unrest in tibet .
his comments increased pressure on beijing ahead of the summer games , which are to be held in china 's capital in august .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london police had their hands full as they arrested 37 protesters on sunday rogge 's comments were made after the london leg of the olympic torch relay was plagued by protests on sunday , with further demonstrations expected in paris on monday .
some 37 people were arrested in london amid chaos on sunday , as british police scuffled with demonstrators protesting china 's crackdown in tibet and other human-rights issues .
one man tried to snatch the olympic torch , and another tried to extinguish the flame .
china : protesters are saboteurs in response , spokesmen for the chinese criticized what they called " tibetan separatists " for committing an " obvious act of defying the olympic spirit , " china 's official xinhua news agency said .
a chinese olympic official accused the protesters of trying to " sabotage " the london leg of the relay , adding , " the act will surely arouse the resentment of the peace-loving people and is bound to fail . "
for its part , the international olympic committee expressed serious concern over the debacle .
at the start of a beijing meeting of national olympic committee heads , rogge called for a " rapid , peaceful resolution of tibet . "
" violence for whatever reason is not compatible with the values of the torch relay or the olympic games , " he said .
heavy criticism of beijing beijing is facing international criticism over its crackdown on protests in tibet that began on march 10 and spread to other areas of china with tibetan populations .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have been killed in the unrest , triggered by what tibetans say has been nearly 60 years of repression under chinese rule .
china insists its security forces have killed no one while trying to quell the protests .
however , it says tibetan " rioters " have killed 20 people .
determining the real situation has proved extremely difficult because china has sealed off tibet and other hotspot areas from foreign journalists , while distributing only its version of events through its state-run press .
at the beijing meeting , rogge dismissed talk of a boycott of the games over tibet and other issues , including human rights .
" some politicians have played with the idea of boycotts .
as i speak today , however , there is no momentum for a generalised boycott , " he said .
" fortunately , the public has realized that boycotts do n't help and only penalize the athletes . "
germans seek to keep focus on sport meanwhile , german olympic officials have reiterated their wish that the games not be used as a protest site by politicians or athletes .
" athletes can speak freely -lsb- within the rules of the olympic charter -rsb- in interviews , in talks and other discussions .
but a sports competition can not be burdened by political demonstrations , " german international olympic committee vice president thomas bach said to dpa news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bach argues in favor of keeping sports and politics seperate bach said he respected that politicians like french president nicolas sarkozy were critical of china in connection with its crackdown in tibet , and were considering a boycott of the opening ceremony .
but , according to bach , who himself was an olympic fencing champion in the 1970s , sport should be respected as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de communications -pipe- 07.04.2008 deutsche telekom faces massive lawsuit by shareholders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom 's famed pink " t " logo is in disarray deutsche telekom is the dock from monday in a landmark lawsuit filed by 16,000 shareholders who feel cheated by the former public phone company and are suing the telecoms giant for up to 80 million euros -lrb- $ 126 million -rrb- . in a case closely watched by the corporate world , deutsche telekom faces a massive lawsuit brought by more than 800 law firms representing thousands of telekom shareholders who say the company inflated the value of its real estate holdings and misled them .
the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .

the complaints relate to events surrounding the company 's third share issue in 2000 , when deutsche telekom sold 200 million shares released by germany 's state development bank .
the plaintiffs , many of whom are small shareholders and invested their life savings in what they perceived to be a safe bet , say they were cheated into buying shares by misleading prospectus information .
one of their main complaints is that deutsche telekom overvalued property assets in the prospectus .
the issue price was 66.50 euros per share , six times what the shares are worth today .
shareholders say they suffered a collective loss of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- because of it .
the company is also alleged to have concealed its plans to buy us wireless company voicestream for about $ 35 billion .
it agreed on the acquisition a month after the subscription period ended .
in 2005 , deutsche telekom settled with us shareholders who had sued in a class action suit over the same issues for $ 120 million .
telekom to change defense strategy the company has denied any wrongdoing in the current case .
" we reiterate what we have said all along : the prospectus was fine , we informed shareholders comprehensively and properly , and we are confident that the court will also see it this way , " a spokesman for deutsche telekom told news agency reuters .
but the company is expected to change tack in its defense strategy on monday , april 7 , in court .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cloudy forecast for telekom german media reported that lawyers for telekom , who had thus far attempted to prove that the share issue in 2000 was above reproach , are to argue that shareholders then " made their moves at the height of the new economy " at a time when the controversial asset value of property did n't play any role .
law firm tilp , which represents numerous plaintiffs , condemned the alleged change in tactic by telekom as an " apparent effort to brand those who bought telekom shares as speculators . "
the firm said it had passed on a dossier to the court with statements by then telekom managers about the " people 's shares . "
" the company 's submission , so shortly before the start of the process , is a slap in the face for millions of t-shareholders who were lured by a massive , months-long advertising campaign about telekom 's supposedly gilt-edged ' people 's shares , " ' the law firm said in a statement .
case moved to large public hall the unprecedented class-action-style case , which may determine how such cases are decided against companies in future , will be watched closely in germany .
the massive number of plaintiffs and a potentially huge public audience have already led authorities to move the high-profile case hearing to a large , specially rented public-events venue in the city of frankfurt .
deutsche telekom chief financial officer karl-gerhard eick and former chief executives kai-uwe ricke and ron sommer are due to appear as witnesses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former telekom boss , ron sommer , will appear as witness in 2005 , german lawmakers created a separate law to govern such mass claims in cases concerning capital markets such as the one facing telekom .

the case is expected to drag on for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 07.04.2008 german olympics official defends no-boycott stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tibetan protesters have accompanied the beijing games from the get-go a top german olympics official has come under increasing fire for his early and absolute stance opposing a boycott of the games .
however , thomas bach is sticking to his guns . bach , the vice president of the german international olympic committee -lrb- dosb -rrb- , has defended his statements that germany will not boycott the olympic games in beijing , despite growing complaints about china 's human rights record and its military opposition to tibet independence .
but criticism of bach is becoming louder in the wake of disruptive demonstrations against the olympic torch relay , as the symbolic flame moved through london over the weekend and headed for paris on monday , april 7 .
in march , despite high-profile unrest among tibetan independence protesters , bach had stated definitively that germany would not boycott the 2008 olympics in beijing .
critics , critics everywhere " after weighing all the arguments , and aware of our responsibilities to the athletes , the dosb will send a team " to the games , bach had told the press on easter monday .
despite chinese repression of tibetan protesters in lhasa , the international olympic committee had " neither the mandate nor the possibility " to intercede , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dosb 's bach : athletes need not carry political weight and as protests around europe on behalf of tibetans flared up over the weekend , bach stuck to his guns in an interview with dpa press agency , saying : " there is mutual agreement , not only among ioc members but within all 205 national olympic committees , to send athletes to the games . "
but criticism of bach 's absolutist stance appears to be growing , among politicians and sports officials alike .
on friday , peter danckert , the chairman of the sports committee in the german parliament , criticized bach for his " precipitous and unnecessary commitment " on the boycott question , and also for his planned participation in the torch relay in china .
over the weekend , other politicians joined in the critiques : hesse premier roland koch commented to the welt am sonntag newspaper that it was " unnecessary -lsb- for bach -rsb- to say there would be no boycott , so early on . "
koch said he thinks holding the games could be ultimately better for the cause of tibet than a boycott , " but there is a critical boundary .
after the violent suppression of the democracy movement -lsb- at tiananmen square -rsb- in 1989 , we could n't have held the olympics . "
carte-blanche for beijing ?
and manfred von richthofen , who led the predecessor organization of the dosb , the dsb , told berlin newspaper tagesspiegel that he felt hurt by bach 's " insensitive course of action . " an early guarantee of sending a team to the games just means those in power in china can feel more secure and wo n't change anything , he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite protests , the flame made it through london the green party , too , accused the german government of giving the chinese carte-blanche for their behavior by ruling out a boycott .
and the head of the bundestag 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , said the dosb had sent a " precipitous and false signal " from germany .
he urged athletes to speak their minds during the games - outside of the competitions .
the ioc has threatened to kick athletes out of the games who protest within the olympic compounds .
bach : " the world is full of war " bach maintains that athletes can speak their minds during the games , but added that a sports contest should not be " weighed down " by political demonstrations .
" there are around 50 wars going on right now in the world , " he told dpa .
" if every one of those countries wanted to have a political demonstration then the games would be overloaded . " dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tackling the credit crunch requires government intervention at a global level , the head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- has said .
the need for public intervention was " becoming more evident " , dominique strauss-kahn told the financial times .
authorities have pumped liquidity into markets but , besides bailing out banks such as northern rock , have not intervened in financial systems .
the securities market and housing sector could get more support , he said .
this , along with more intervention in the banking sector , would offer a " third line of defence " , mr strauss-kahn told the newspaper .
the comments come ahead of a gathering of world financial leaders at the imf 's spring meeting in washington dc .
justin urquhart stewart of seven investment management said the move proposed by the imf would need more co-ordinated and effective work between governments .
" we 've gone from the idea of the banks just providing access to extra cash , to intervening on odd occasions , then to the final line when were actually saying we 're going to have to stand behind this and formally intervene overall in the market to support it , " he told the bbc .
" rather than just waiting for individual banks to go wrong the weaker banks will need further help , and it 's going to be more than just access to liquidity . "

the need for public intervention was " becoming more evident " , dominique strauss-kahn told the financial times .
authorities have pumped liquidity into markets but , besides bailing out banks such as northern rock , have not intervened in financial systems .
the securities market and housing sector could get more support , he said .
this , along with more intervention in the banking sector , would offer a " third line of defence " , mr strauss-kahn told the newspaper .
the comments come ahead of a gathering of world financial leaders at the imf 's spring meeting in washington dc .
justin urquhart stewart of seven investment management said the move proposed by the imf would need more co-ordinated and effective work between governments .
" we 've gone from the idea of the banks just providing access to extra cash , to intervening on odd occasions , then to the final line when were actually saying we 're going to have to stand behind this and formally intervene overall in the market to support it , " he told the bbc .
" rather than just waiting for individual banks to go wrong the weaker banks will need further help , and it 's going to be more than just access to liquidity . "

by paranjoy guha thakurta indian economy analyst inflation hurts the poor most is india , the world 's second most populous nation , facing a food crisis ?
this question is vexing policy makers and analysts alike even as creeping inflation - around 7 % now - is sending jitters through the congress party-led ruling coalition .
to be sure , india has not yet experienced riots over rising food prices that have hit other countries like zimbabwe or argentina .
but what is worrying everybody is that the current rise in inflation is driven by high food prices .
in the capital , delhi , milk costs 11 % more than last year .
edible oil prices have climbed by a whopping 40 % over the same period .
more crucially , rice prices have risen by 20 % and prices of certain lentils by 18 % .
rice and lentils comprise the staple diet for many indians .
tax on the poor inflation , economists say , is akin to a tax on the poor since food accounts for a relatively high proportion of their expenses .
all of which is bad news for ruling politicians because the poor in india vote in much larger numbers than the affluent .
roughly one out of four indians lives on less than $ 1 a day and three out of four earn $ 2 or less .
the rise in food prices , the government says , is an international phenomenon .
but this argument is unlikely to cut much ice with the people .
food prices have risen sharply in the past year at the crux of the crisis is the tardy pace at which farm output has been growing in recent years .
the indian economy has been growing rapidly at an average of 8.5 % over the last five years .
this growth has been mainly confined to manufacturing industry and the burgeoning services sector .
agriculture , on the other hand , has grown by barely 2.5 % over the last five years and the trend rate of growth is even lower if the past decade and a half is considered .
consequently , per capita output of cereals -lrb- wheat and rice -rrb- at present is more or less at the level that prevailed in the 1970s .
the problem acquires a serious dimension since farming provides livelihood to around 60 % of india 's 1.1 billion people even though farm produce comprises only 18 % of the country 's current gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
on the other hand , the services sector - that includes the fast-growing computer software and business process outsourcing industries - constitutes over 55 % of gdp with the remainder being taken up by industry .
the crisis in farms is exemplified by the state of the country 's cereal stocks .
vulnerable farmers six years ago , the stocks were at record levels .
nobel laureate economist amartya sen had said if all the bags of wheat and rice with the state-owned food corporation of india were placed end to end , they would go all the way to the moon and back .
stocks have come down over the past three years because of low production and exports .
the problem has been compounded by the fact that whenever india has imported wheat in recent months , world prices of wheat have shot up .
growth in the farm sector has been sluggish there is also considerable resentment over the fact that the price of wheat that the government imports is often twice as high as the minimum price the government pay its own farmers for domestically grown wheat .
indian farmers are particularly vulnerable since 60 % per cent of the country 's total cropped area is not irrigated .
they are also dependent on the four-month-long monsoon during which period 80 % of the year 's total rainfall takes place .
the crisis in agriculture has been manifest in the growing incidence of farmers taking their own lives .
at least 10,000 farmers have committed suicide each year over the last decade because of their inability of repay loans taken at usurious rates of interest from local moneylenders .
populist moves there has never been an acute shortage of food in india , not even during the infamous famine in bengal in 1943 in which more than 1.5 million people are estimated to have died of starvation .
the problem then - and now - is entitlement or access to food at affordable prices .
given the low purchasing power of india 's poor , even a small increase in food prices contributes to a sharp fall in real incomes .
the current crisis in indian agriculture is a consequence of many factors - low rise in farm productivity , unremunerative prices for cultivators , poor food storage facilities resulting in high levels of wastage .
rising food prices has made the government jittery fragmentation of land holdings and a fall in public investments in rural areas , especially in irrigation facilities , are also to blame .
the government has announced a $ 15bn waiver of farmer loans and extended a jobs scheme - ensuring 100 days of work in a year entailing manual labour to every family demanding such work at the official minimum wage - to all over the country .
none of these populist initiatives will really work until india 's rulers begin giving its ignored farms the importance they deserve .

at least 10,000 farmers have committed suicide each year over the last decade because of their inability of repay loans taken at usurious rates of interest from local moneylenders .
populist moves there has never been an acute shortage of food in india , not even during the infamous famine in bengal in 1943 in which more than 1.5 million people are estimated to have died of starvation .
the problem then - and now - is entitlement or access to food at affordable prices .
given the low purchasing power of india 's poor , even a small increase in food prices contributes to a sharp fall in real incomes .
the current crisis in indian agriculture is a consequence of many factors - low rise in farm productivity , unremunerative prices for cultivators , poor food storage facilities resulting in high levels of wastage .
fragmentation of land holdings and a fall in public investments in rural areas , especially in irrigation facilities , are also to blame .
the government has announced a $ 15bn waiver of farmer loans and extended a jobs scheme - ensuring 100 days of work in a year entailing manual labour to every family demanding such work at the official minimum wage - to all over the country .
none of these populist initiatives will really work until india 's rulers begin giving its ignored farms the importance they deserve .

in its report on the 2008 budget , the treasury select committee said the treasury now faced a major challenge in meeting its own targets .
" some of the very things that kept our economy growing over the last decade may start to cause us problems " , said the committee 's chairman john mcfall .
the uk faces an economic slowdown while public borrowing has soared .
evidence suggests that the treasury 's forecasts remained optimistic despite downward revisions , said the report .
in the 2008 budget , chancellor alistair darling warned that economic growth this year and next would be slower than the government expected .
it seems strange that the abolition of the 10 pence starting rate of income tax disadvantages mainly low income households treasury select committee low-paid ' hit by changes ' he reduced his growth forecast for 2008 to 1.75 % -2.25 % , well below the 2.5 % -3 % predicted in last year 's budget .
he also said public borrowing would rise to £ 43bn next year , rather than falling to £ 36bn as he had hoped .
the treasury 's optimism is based on the view that it is better positioned than other oecd nations in relation to market turmoil , said the report .
but characteristics that have helped in the past - including rapidly rising residential property prices , close links with the us and an increasing reliance on the financial services sector - could be the " conduits " through which global market problems reach the uk , it said .
the government would need to be " extremely vigilant in how it manages the public finances if it wishes to maintain its so far clean record in meeting its own fiscal rules , " said mr mcfall .
" the government 's own forecasts show that it will be extremely tight as to whether it will meet the sustainable investment rule , " he added .
under this rule , aimed at preventing a chancellor from spending and borrowing too much , public-sector debt must be no more than 40 per cent of british economic output or gdp .
' main losers ' the report also cited concerns around child poverty reduction targets .
while it welcomed the government 's aim to halve child poverty by 2010-11 , how this was going to be achieved was unclear .
it said the government needed to make " an unambiguous commitment " to the resources to attain such goals .
another area highlighted by the report included the impact of the new 10 pence tax rate .
the committee concluded that " the main losers " from the abolition of the 10 pence rate of income tax were those under 65 years old with an income under £ 18,500 in childless households .
this group seemed an " unreasonable target " in the government 's plans to raise further taxes .
" it seems strange that the abolition of the 10 pence starting rate of income tax disadvantages mainly low income households . "
the committee also showed concern over the poor take-up rate of working tax credit among eligible families without children .
on the topic of non-domiciled individuals , the committee cautioned that following a focus on the wealthy in this group , " there has been insufficient consideration " of the possible impact of tax changes on middle and lower income individuals .

farmers say the strawberry crop may be hit mrs snell , who runs the 250-acre farm near hereford with her husband , said they lost more than £ 200,000 because of the wasted fruit .
she now fears the situation could get even worse because of new immigration restrictions .
farmers say migrant workers from eu countries have higher aspirations than earning money in the uk by fruit-picking .
and they now fear changes in legislation will make it very difficult for non-eu workers to fill the gap .
the seasonal agricultural workers scheme -lrb- saws -rrb- - which has previously enabled workers from non-eu countries such as ukraine to do low-skilled work in the uk - is to be restricted to romanians and bulgarians , who are members of the eu .
' heartbreaking ' situation farmers say the new rules will exacerbate the labour shortage caused when the saws scheme cut its quota from 25,000 to 16,520 in 2004 .
the government said migrants from new eu countries such as poland and the czech republic would plug the labour gap .
seasonal work includes cleaning glasshouses but mrs snell , who is also a director of concordia , which finds seasonal workers for farms , said eu workers did not want to pick fruit .
" their aspirations are higher and with the free right to work , eu workers are going to factories , hospitality , things like the olympic project , service stations and nursing homes , " she said .
she said the situation was " heartbreaking " and crop wastages could lead to supermarkets buying more produce from abroad .
anna rosa , from warsaw , poland , was among people who benefited from saws .
as an agricultural student 11 years ago , she picked strawberries on a farm in ledbury , herefordshire .
ms rosa , 33 , said at that time there were " 10 people to each place " on the saws scheme .
" it was a great opportunity and was a life-changing experience , especially in financial terms , " she said .
" it changed you from relying on your parents , to being independent . "
now recruitment manager for hops labour solutions , a warwickshire organisation supplying seasonal workers , she said labour shortages were now a huge concern .
' biggest threat ' she said the scheme was no longer attracting thousands of full-time students from poland who used to take part .
it also previously recruited students from places including ukraine , belarus , and armenia , who were now excluded from saws .
a fall in the pound 's value and improving eastern european economies had made it an " employee market " , she added .
ben drummond , who farms in ross-on-wye , herefordshire , said he believed the changes in saws had led to " the biggest threat currently facing our industry " .
mr byrne defended the reforms he said he had already deliberately reduced his crop output so he needed 400 workers not 500 this year .
" i am not quite sure what i 'm going to do , or where the workers will come from , " he added .
the home office has blamed the changes to saws on the unique position of romanians and bulgarians who , unlike other eu workers , have restrictions placed on them working in the uk .
it said it could not restrict labour market access for them while allowing non-eu workers to carry out the same work .
but the nfu disputes this and is taking legal advice .
it has called for saws permits to be raised to 21,000 .
an nfu spokeswoman said saws had been operating for 60 years " without causing any problem " for immigration .
but immigration minister liam byrne said that low-skilled migration from outside the eu was being phased out because " businesses should hire those close to home first " .
mr byrne , also minister for the west midlands , said : " some people have told us our immigration reforms are too draconian , but i think they 're right for britain . "
however , farmers like mrs snell still disagree .
she said the government had been " extremely short-sighted " to interfere with such a " stable and well-managed " scheme .
and after having to turn down what she said were hundreds of students from non-eu countries over the winter , she said she was bracing herself for more disappointment this summer .

' heartbreaking ' situation farmers say the new rules will exacerbate the labour shortage caused when the saws scheme cut its quota from 25,000 to 16,520 in 2004 .
the government said migrants from new eu countries such as poland and the czech republic would plug the labour gap .
seasonal work includes cleaning glasshouses but mrs snell , who is also a director of concordia , which finds seasonal workers for farms , said eu workers did not want to pick fruit .
" their aspirations are higher and with the free right to work , eu workers are going to factories , hospitality , things like the olympic project , service stations and nursing homes , " she said .
she said the situation was " heartbreaking " and crop wastages could lead to supermarkets buying more produce from abroad .
anna rosa , from warsaw , poland , was among people who benefited from saws .
as an agricultural student 11 years ago , she picked strawberries on a farm in ledbury , herefordshire .
ms rosa , 33 , said at that time there were " 10 people to each place " on the saws scheme .
" it was a great opportunity and was a life-changing experience , especially in financial terms , " she said .
" it changed you from relying on your parents , to being independent . "
now recruitment manager for hops labour solutions , a warwickshire organisation supplying seasonal workers , she said labour shortages were now a huge concern .
' biggest threat ' she said the scheme was no longer attracting thousands of full-time students from poland who used to take part .
it also previously recruited students from places including ukraine , belarus , and armenia , who were now excluded from saws .
a fall in the pound 's value and improving eastern european economies had made it an " employee market " , she added .
ben drummond , who farms in ross-on-wye , herefordshire , said he believed the changes in saws had led to " the biggest threat currently facing our industry " .
mr byrne defended the reforms he said he had already deliberately reduced his crop output so he needed 400 workers not 500 this year .
" i am not quite sure what i 'm going to do , or where the workers will come from , " he added .
the home office has blamed the changes to saws on the unique position of romanians and bulgarians who , unlike other eu workers , have restrictions placed on them working in the uk .
it said it could not restrict labour market access for them while allowing non-eu workers to carry out the same work .
but the nfu disputes this and is taking legal advice .
it has called for saws permits to be raised to 21,000 .
an nfu spokeswoman said saws had been operating for 60 years " without causing any problem " for immigration .
but immigration minister liam byrne said that low-skilled migration from outside the eu was being phased out because " businesses should hire those close to home first " .
mr byrne , also minister for the west midlands , said : " some people have told us our immigration reforms are too draconian , but i think they 're right for britain . "
however , farmers like mrs snell still disagree .
she said the government had been " extremely short-sighted " to interfere with such a " stable and well-managed " scheme .
and after having to turn down what she said were hundreds of students from non-eu countries over the winter , she said she was bracing herself for more disappointment this summer .

farmers say the strawberry crop may be hit mrs snell , who runs the 250-acre farm near hereford with her husband , said they lost more than £ 200,000 because of the wasted fruit .

that album , dummy , mixed samples from old jazz records alongside dj scratches , snatches of lalo schifrin instrumentals , isaac hayes guitar riffs , skittering beats and the chilling voice of frontwoman beth gibbons .
in a music scene suddenly obsessed with plundering the rinky-dink piano riffs of the kinks and the simpler end of the beatles ' canon , portishead 's debut was an intriguing alternative .
within months , they became one of britain 's biggest cult bands , a three-headed collective built around gibbons , guitarist adrian utley and self-confessed hip-hop obsessive geoff barrow .
decade-long silence dummy became an unexpected hit and won 1995 's mercury prize for the best british or irish album of the year .
by 1997 , when their self-titled second album came out , things were even more widescreen and menacing .
the strong follow-up was itself followed by a live release - complete with orchestra - recorded in new york .
and then ?
burnt out from a year-long tour that saw them headline festivals to crowds of 50,000 , portishead took some serious time out .
speaking amidst gulps of earl grey tea in a london hotel , utley admits portishead had pushed themselves too far .
" those years were quite dark , " he admits .
" there was no sense of ' right , let 's do another record ' - there absolutely was n't .
we were absolutely exhausted . "
on top of that , both utley and barrow 's marriages had ended .
" our lives had gone into meltdown , " the guitarist adds .
" there were times when i thought , ' this is not going to happen , " ' he says .
" we had nick gatfield , our md from island -lsb- the band 's record label -rsb- , come down and listen to seven tracks .
we said we 'd meet him in a couple of months , we 'd have a load more tracks and we 'd pretty much be there .
" and almost exactly a year later we had six tracks . "
" it 's taken probably four years to do - it 's just the way it worked this time , when we 've got kids and stuff , life 's a bit more chaotic " adrian utley while utley points out the band never felt like giving up and always felt third would see the light of day , progress was painstaking .
there were sessions in australia which were encouraging but did n't result in any songs .
gibbons took time out to make another record , rustin man , and toured it .
in an industry built around a two-year cycle between albums - three if your band 's called radiohead - the delay is certainly out of the ordinary .
" it 's taken probably four years to do ; it 's just the way it worked this time .
when we 've got kids and stuff , life 's a bit more chaotic this time , " utley explains .
" it 's our difficulty in getting things to the stage where we 're happy with them . "
but ultimately he is happy third was not assembled too easily .
" the more we mould together , the less interesting the music will be , we 've got to keep that jaggedy edge . "
for the most part , third breaks away from the downtempo feel of the first two records in favour of something much darker .
tracks such as the post-punk flavoured the rip sound like the work of another band .
" all of the things came out of - as always with portishead - a hard road that we walk , without composition or structure of music , " says utley .
" it 's painful and just difficult , really . "
' a journey ' what has emerged is an album very much out of step with its predecessors .
the opener , silence , bursts out of the blocks with cowbells , pounding tribal percussion , doom-laden strings and psychedelically-distorted guitars .
" that song , like many , had a life before it is as you hear it .
it was just a really beautiful song that beth had written with some quite strange time signatures . "
geoff barrow ended up creating the pounding tribal drum rhythm .
it 's unlike anything on their first two records .
" that 's what we 're always trying to strive to do , " utley says .
" we might have something that simple as an idea , and we 're trying to find a reason for it to live and go ahead .
it 's a journey .
there are mad , improvised things we edited too . "
he adds : " i think within us we have kind of manifesto .
it 's an unwritten one ... it 's like a dogma film manifesto .
we can break the rules because we know them . "
he sums up the group 's dynamic as " bits that do n't fit " .
he says it is " those little conflicts that make things interesting " .
the band unveiled several of the new album 's songs in december to fans at the all tomorrow 's party mini-festival in the uk , and the results , utley says , were promising .
" when we played the new tracks , it seemed like they were more into them than they were into the old ones . "
portishead 's uk tour starts on 9 april .
they will preview their new material on current tv from 11 april with the album , third , released on 28 april .

they showed that " free expression and demonstration " were part of the workings of a democracy , she added .
she also said receiving the torch at downing street was not an endorsement of china 's human rights record .
the 31-mile parade was heavily policed with frequent scuffles with protesters and an attempt to snatch the flame from ex-blue peter presenter konnie huq .
prime minister gordon brown had come under some pressure not to take part from pro-tibet protesters and some mps .
the leader of the uk 's third largest party , lib dem nick clegg , said it was " wholly inappropriate " for mr brown to take part in the ceremony .
beijing will host this year 's olympics but there have been calls for a boycott of the games , over events in tibet .
boycott call mr brown has already resisted calls to boycott the opening ceremony of the games .
on sunday he looked on as olympic gold medallist denise lewis carried the torch through downing street 's gates .
it 's wholly inappropriate that gordon brown is participating in this torch bearing ceremony today nick clegg scuffles mar olympic torch relay but mr clegg told the bbc on sunday it was a " mistake " for mr brown to be involved with the torch ceremony and britain had to be clear with the chinese authorities that they needed to " play by the rules " .
" the cornerstone of those international rules is that we all respect those fundamental human rights to which we , the british , have always attached a great deal of significance , " he said .
" and that 's why it 's wholly inappropriate that gordon brown is participating in this torch bearing ceremony today . "
former labour minister kate hoey told the bbc the passage of the torch through london was a " complete farce " and said gordon brown had been " very , very mild " with china over its actions in tibet .
