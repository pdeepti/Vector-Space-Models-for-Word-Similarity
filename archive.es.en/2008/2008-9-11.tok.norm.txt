they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .

" germany will not shirk its responsibilities in the caucasus conflict , " merkel 's office said , summarizing remarks she made late wednesday at an awards ceremony held by a publishing house .
" about one-fifth of the eu observers in georgia are to come from germany , " the statement added .
merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .
russia , however , will keep 3,800 troops in the two rebel enclaves .
under the peace accord , the eu monitors will remain in the buffer zones between these troops and georgia .
peace plan in doubt ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail saakashvili -lrb- r -rrb- and nicolas sarkozy presenting the cease-fire plan russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility of eu observers gaining access to south ossetia or abkhazia , afp reported .
the move threw into doubt the new peace plan .
" additional international observers will be deployed precisely around south ossetia and abkhazia and not inside these republics , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists in moscow .
sarkozy , speaking at the head of an eu delegation early tuesday alongside georgian president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi , said : " the spirit of the text is that they -lrb- the eu observers -rrb- will have a mandate to enter -lrb- abkhazia and south ossetia -rrb- , to observe , to report . "
south ossetian leader flip-flops over province joining russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity has flip-flopped on south ossetia 's joining russian federation south ossetia 's separatist leader early thursday , sept .
11 , had said that his breakaway region intends to become part of russia , interfax news agency had reported .
" of course we will become part of russia . we 're not intending to set up some independent ossetia , " eduard kokoity had been quoted as saying during a meeting of a kremlin discussion group in the southern russian city of sochi .
however , kokoity soon after denied reports south ossetia hoped to join russia , interfax later reported .
" obviously , i was misunderstood , " he said less than an hour after he was quoted by news agencies as saying " without a doubt we will become part of russia , " news agency dpa reported .
speaking later , kokoity said : " we are not going to refuse the independence which has come to us through enormous sacrifice , and south ossetia is not going to become part of russia , " dpa reported .
interfax quoted kokoity as saying that the region - the site of last month 's war between russia and georgia - - intends to unite with north ossetia , across the border in russia .
russia has already recognized south ossetia as an independent nation , along with abkhazia .
policeman killed on wednesday , georgia reported one of its policemen was shot dead from a russian position in violation of the fragile truce , as a major crack appeared in the eu-brokered ceasefire over the remit of eu observers .
the georgians said it was the first fatal shooting since the august 12 ceasefire that brought an end to the five-day war between georgia and russia over georgia 's breakaway region of south ossetia .
georgia 's interior ministry told afp the officer died in hospital from wounds to the head and throat after being fired on near karaleti , a key russian position on the road from the georgian city of gori to south ossetia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.09.2008 oecd blasts german immigration policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seasonal workers are not a long-term solution to germany 's problems , the oecd says compared to most other western nations , germany attracts fewer immigrants and their numbers are falling .
the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .

according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .

his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .
a new world order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's visit to germany earlier this year was controversial but in hamburg this week , steinmeier chose to stress china 's progress .
speaking at the opening of the summit , he hailed the country 's growing role on the international stage .
" we are seeking a new world order , " he said .
" new political and economic centers of powers are emerging , and china is one of them . "
without dialogue with these emerging nations , including brazil , russia and india as well as china , a new world order would be hard to establish , he went on .
current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "
zhang is set to stay in germany until friday .

russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "

in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .

washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .

10 .
his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .
a new world order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's visit to germany earlier this year was controversial but in hamburg this week , steinmeier chose to stress china 's progress .
speaking at the opening of the summit , he hailed the country 's growing role on the international stage .
" we are seeking a new world order , " he said .
" new political and economic centers of powers are emerging , and china is one of them . "

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .
10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .

not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .

and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .

11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .

it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .

coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .
seven years later we are unfortunately still a long way off . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.09.2008 film about thalidomide victims breaks emotional taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody 's perfect in a new documentary called " nobody 's perfect , " twelve ' thalidomiders ' demonstrate that their disabilities are no obstacle to leading a fulfilling life and break a number of emotional taboos in the process . thalidomide was developed by german pharmaceutical company gruenenthal near aachen , and sold from 1957 to 1961 in almost 50 countries to pregnant women to combat morning sickness .
before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .

and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .

" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "

among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.09.2008 russia continues criticism of missile shield during poland talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia maintains that the us missile shield is targeting its nuclear deterrent russian foreign minister sergei lavrov met with polish counterpart radek sikorski in warsaw thursday , sept .
11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "
us presidential hopefuls wo n't target russia : sikorski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us presidential candidate barack obama says he would n't target russia sikorski said he hoped that , in time , russian worries over the system will subside .
he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .
washington 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says its missile system will guard against rogue states like iran poland and the united states signed a deal on august 14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .
poland also drew russia 's anger by leading several former eastern bloc countries in calling for a tough eu stance against russia over the latter 's conduct in a brief conflict with georgia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .

" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .

" germany will not shirk its responsibilities in the caucasus conflict , " merkel 's office said , summarizing remarks she made late wednesday at an awards ceremony held by a publishing house .

merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .

speaking later , kokoity said : " we are not going to refuse the independence which has come to us through enormous sacrifice , and south ossetia is not going to become part of russia , " dpa reported .
interfax quoted kokoity as saying that the region - the site of last month 's war between russia and georgia - - intends to unite with north ossetia , across the border in russia .
russia has already recognized south ossetia as an independent nation , along with abkhazia .
policeman killed on wednesday , georgia reported one of its policemen was shot dead from a russian position in violation of the fragile truce , as a major crack appeared in the eu-brokered ceasefire over the remit of eu observers .
the georgians said it was the first fatal shooting since the august 12 ceasefire that brought an end to the five-day war between georgia and russia over georgia 's breakaway region of south ossetia .

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .

it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .

nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .

the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "

his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .

current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .

11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "

he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .

washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .

for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "
us presidential hopefuls wo n't target russia : sikorski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us presidential candidate barack obama says he would n't target russia sikorski said he hoped that , in time , russian worries over the system will subside .
he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .
washington 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says its missile system will guard against rogue states like iran poland and the united states signed a deal on august 14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .
poland also drew russia 's anger by leading several former eastern bloc countries in calling for a tough eu stance against russia over the latter 's conduct in a brief conflict with georgia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .
10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .
seven years later we are unfortunately still a long way off . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "
us presidential hopefuls wo n't target russia : sikorski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us presidential candidate barack obama says he would n't target russia sikorski said he hoped that , in time , russian worries over the system will subside .
he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .
washington 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says its missile system will guard against rogue states like iran poland and the united states signed a deal on august 14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .
poland also drew russia 's anger by leading several former eastern bloc countries in calling for a tough eu stance against russia over the latter 's conduct in a brief conflict with georgia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.09.2008 experts : less is sometimes more in fight against terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ground zero remains a symbol of the need for targeted security measures as the world marks the seventh anniversary of 9/11 , some european experts say security improvements in the us have been undercut by fairly basic mistakes .
among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .
but the us should also be wary , they caution , of half-cocked measures that unintentionally undermine security - and make such attacks a bit more likely . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will not shirk its responsibilities in the caucasus conflict , " merkel 's office said , summarizing remarks she made late wednesday at an awards ceremony held by a publishing house .
" about one-fifth of the eu observers in georgia are to come from germany , " the statement added .
merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .
russia , however , will keep 3,800 troops in the two rebel enclaves .
under the peace accord , the eu monitors will remain in the buffer zones between these troops and georgia .
peace plan in doubt ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail saakashvili -lrb- r -rrb- and nicolas sarkozy presenting the cease-fire plan russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility of eu observers gaining access to south ossetia or abkhazia , afp reported .
the move threw into doubt the new peace plan .
" additional international observers will be deployed precisely around south ossetia and abkhazia and not inside these republics , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists in moscow .
sarkozy , speaking at the head of an eu delegation early tuesday alongside georgian president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi , said : " the spirit of the text is that they -lrb- the eu observers -rrb- will have a mandate to enter -lrb- abkhazia and south ossetia -rrb- , to observe , to report . "
south ossetian leader flip-flops over province joining russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity has flip-flopped on south ossetia 's joining russian federation south ossetia 's separatist leader early thursday , sept .
11 , had said that his breakaway region intends to become part of russia , interfax news agency had reported .
" of course we will become part of russia . we 're not intending to set up some independent ossetia , " eduard kokoity had been quoted as saying during a meeting of a kremlin discussion group in the southern russian city of sochi .
however , kokoity soon after denied reports south ossetia hoped to join russia , interfax later reported .
" obviously , i was misunderstood , " he said less than an hour after he was quoted by news agencies as saying " without a doubt we will become part of russia , " news agency dpa reported .
speaking later , kokoity said : " we are not going to refuse the independence which has come to us through enormous sacrifice , and south ossetia is not going to become part of russia , " dpa reported .
interfax quoted kokoity as saying that the region - the site of last month 's war between russia and georgia - - intends to unite with north ossetia , across the border in russia .
russia has already recognized south ossetia as an independent nation , along with abkhazia .
policeman killed on wednesday , georgia reported one of its policemen was shot dead from a russian position in violation of the fragile truce , as a major crack appeared in the eu-brokered ceasefire over the remit of eu observers .
the georgians said it was the first fatal shooting since the august 12 ceasefire that brought an end to the five-day war between georgia and russia over georgia 's breakaway region of south ossetia .
georgia 's interior ministry told afp the officer died in hospital from wounds to the head and throat after being fired on near karaleti , a key russian position on the road from the georgian city of gori to south ossetia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .

such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .

russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "

in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .
this makes germans some of the strongest migration groups in denmark , luxemburg , the netherlands , austria , poland and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .

in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .

his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .
a new world order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's visit to germany earlier this year was controversial but in hamburg this week , steinmeier chose to stress china 's progress .
speaking at the opening of the summit , he hailed the country 's growing role on the international stage .
" we are seeking a new world order , " he said .
" new political and economic centers of powers are emerging , and china is one of them . "
without dialogue with these emerging nations , including brazil , russia and india as well as china , a new world order would be hard to establish , he went on .
current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "
zhang is set to stay in germany until friday .
along with his political meetings , he is expected to visit companies including volkswagen , airbus , thyssen-krupp , basf and deutsche bahn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "
us presidential hopefuls wo n't target russia : sikorski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us presidential candidate barack obama says he would n't target russia sikorski said he hoped that , in time , russian worries over the system will subside .
he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .
washington 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says its missile system will guard against rogue states like iran poland and the united states signed a deal on august 14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .
poland also drew russia 's anger by leading several former eastern bloc countries in calling for a tough eu stance against russia over the latter 's conduct in a brief conflict with georgia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .

" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .

his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .

without dialogue with these emerging nations , including brazil , russia and india as well as china , a new world order would be hard to establish , he went on .
current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .
but the us should also be wary , they caution , of half-cocked measures that unintentionally undermine security - and make such attacks a bit more likely . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .
10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .

11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "

" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .

in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .

" germany will not shirk its responsibilities in the caucasus conflict , " merkel 's office said , summarizing remarks she made late wednesday at an awards ceremony held by a publishing house .
" about one-fifth of the eu observers in georgia are to come from germany , " the statement added .
merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .
russia , however , will keep 3,800 troops in the two rebel enclaves .
under the peace accord , the eu monitors will remain in the buffer zones between these troops and georgia .
peace plan in doubt ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail saakashvili -lrb- r -rrb- and nicolas sarkozy presenting the cease-fire plan russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility of eu observers gaining access to south ossetia or abkhazia , afp reported .
the move threw into doubt the new peace plan .
" additional international observers will be deployed precisely around south ossetia and abkhazia and not inside these republics , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists in moscow .
sarkozy , speaking at the head of an eu delegation early tuesday alongside georgian president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi , said : " the spirit of the text is that they -lrb- the eu observers -rrb- will have a mandate to enter -lrb- abkhazia and south ossetia -rrb- , to observe , to report . "
south ossetian leader flip-flops over province joining russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity has flip-flopped on south ossetia 's joining russian federation south ossetia 's separatist leader early thursday , sept .
11 , had said that his breakaway region intends to become part of russia , interfax news agency had reported .
" of course we will become part of russia . we 're not intending to set up some independent ossetia , " eduard kokoity had been quoted as saying during a meeting of a kremlin discussion group in the southern russian city of sochi .
however , kokoity soon after denied reports south ossetia hoped to join russia , interfax later reported .
" obviously , i was misunderstood , " he said less than an hour after he was quoted by news agencies as saying " without a doubt we will become part of russia , " news agency dpa reported .
speaking later , kokoity said : " we are not going to refuse the independence which has come to us through enormous sacrifice , and south ossetia is not going to become part of russia , " dpa reported .
interfax quoted kokoity as saying that the region - the site of last month 's war between russia and georgia - - intends to unite with north ossetia , across the border in russia .
russia has already recognized south ossetia as an independent nation , along with abkhazia .
policeman killed on wednesday , georgia reported one of its policemen was shot dead from a russian position in violation of the fragile truce , as a major crack appeared in the eu-brokered ceasefire over the remit of eu observers .
the georgians said it was the first fatal shooting since the august 12 ceasefire that brought an end to the five-day war between georgia and russia over georgia 's breakaway region of south ossetia .
georgia 's interior ministry told afp the officer died in hospital from wounds to the head and throat after being fired on near karaleti , a key russian position on the road from the georgian city of gori to south ossetia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .

11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "
us presidential hopefuls wo n't target russia : sikorski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us presidential candidate barack obama says he would n't target russia sikorski said he hoped that , in time , russian worries over the system will subside .
he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .
washington 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says its missile system will guard against rogue states like iran poland and the united states signed a deal on august 14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .
poland also drew russia 's anger by leading several former eastern bloc countries in calling for a tough eu stance against russia over the latter 's conduct in a brief conflict with georgia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .
10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .

11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 .
his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .
a new world order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's visit to germany earlier this year was controversial but in hamburg this week , steinmeier chose to stress china 's progress .
speaking at the opening of the summit , he hailed the country 's growing role on the international stage .
" we are seeking a new world order , " he said .
" new political and economic centers of powers are emerging , and china is one of them . "
without dialogue with these emerging nations , including brazil , russia and india as well as china , a new world order would be hard to establish , he went on .
current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "
zhang is set to stay in germany until friday .
along with his political meetings , he is expected to visit companies including volkswagen , airbus , thyssen-krupp , basf and deutsche bahn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .

the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .

10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "

victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .
10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .

merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .

the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .

" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .

the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .
seven years later we are unfortunately still a long way off . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.09.2008 film about thalidomide victims breaks emotional taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody 's perfect in a new documentary called " nobody 's perfect , " twelve ' thalidomiders ' demonstrate that their disabilities are no obstacle to leading a fulfilling life and break a number of emotional taboos in the process . thalidomide was developed by german pharmaceutical company gruenenthal near aachen , and sold from 1957 to 1961 in almost 50 countries to pregnant women to combat morning sickness .
before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany will not shirk its responsibilities in the caucasus conflict , " merkel 's office said , summarizing remarks she made late wednesday at an awards ceremony held by a publishing house .
" about one-fifth of the eu observers in georgia are to come from germany , " the statement added .
merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .
russia , however , will keep 3,800 troops in the two rebel enclaves .
under the peace accord , the eu monitors will remain in the buffer zones between these troops and georgia .
peace plan in doubt ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail saakashvili -lrb- r -rrb- and nicolas sarkozy presenting the cease-fire plan russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility of eu observers gaining access to south ossetia or abkhazia , afp reported .
the move threw into doubt the new peace plan .
" additional international observers will be deployed precisely around south ossetia and abkhazia and not inside these republics , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists in moscow .
sarkozy , speaking at the head of an eu delegation early tuesday alongside georgian president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi , said : " the spirit of the text is that they -lrb- the eu observers -rrb- will have a mandate to enter -lrb- abkhazia and south ossetia -rrb- , to observe , to report . "
south ossetian leader flip-flops over province joining russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity has flip-flopped on south ossetia 's joining russian federation south ossetia 's separatist leader early thursday , sept .
11 , had said that his breakaway region intends to become part of russia , interfax news agency had reported .
" of course we will become part of russia . we 're not intending to set up some independent ossetia , " eduard kokoity had been quoted as saying during a meeting of a kremlin discussion group in the southern russian city of sochi .
however , kokoity soon after denied reports south ossetia hoped to join russia , interfax later reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.09.2008 film about thalidomide victims breaks emotional taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody 's perfect in a new documentary called " nobody 's perfect , " twelve ' thalidomiders ' demonstrate that their disabilities are no obstacle to leading a fulfilling life and break a number of emotional taboos in the process . thalidomide was developed by german pharmaceutical company gruenenthal near aachen , and sold from 1957 to 1961 in almost 50 countries to pregnant women to combat morning sickness .
before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .
" the oxymoron is that arctic fossil fuel production is actually contributing to the arctic being destroyed indirectly by introducing the co2 that will warm the arctic , " he said .
rich in resources bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are unsure how much energy could be beneath arctic ice there are many fragile areas in the arctic and sommerkorn said he supports " no-go zones " in environmentally fragile regions and a moratorium on off-shore oil production and transport in the arctic .
" there are currently no techniques available that would allow oil spills to be cleaned up in ice effected waters , " he said , adding that arctic politics need to shift from focusing on oil and gas exploration to climate protection .
presently , natural resources and energy claims of interest are usually dealt with according to the united nations convention on the law of the sea -lrb- unclos -rrb- .
the us geological survey estimates that the arctic region could hold 13 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil reserves and 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas .
" given all the pressures that are on the arctic ecosystems and that will increase in the future with climate change we can only go for an integrated response to alleviate these pressures , " sommerkorn said he approved efforts to coordinate international arctic policy , but explained that mitigating the impact of global warming should come first .
a report published just before to the conference said the nordic council it was " quite clear that the eu needs to take a more pro-active and systematic approach to the arctic , encompassing all the relevant policy areas .

11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "
us presidential hopefuls wo n't target russia : sikorski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us presidential candidate barack obama says he would n't target russia sikorski said he hoped that , in time , russian worries over the system will subside .
he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .
washington 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says its missile system will guard against rogue states like iran poland and the united states signed a deal on august 14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .
poland also drew russia 's anger by leading several former eastern bloc countries in calling for a tough eu stance against russia over the latter 's conduct in a brief conflict with georgia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.09.2008 experts : less is sometimes more in fight against terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ground zero remains a symbol of the need for targeted security measures as the world marks the seventh anniversary of 9/11 , some european experts say security improvements in the us have been undercut by fairly basic mistakes .
among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .
but the us should also be wary , they caution , of half-cocked measures that unintentionally undermine security - and make such attacks a bit more likely . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.09.2008 experts : less is sometimes more in fight against terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ground zero remains a symbol of the need for targeted security measures as the world marks the seventh anniversary of 9/11 , some european experts say security improvements in the us have been undercut by fairly basic mistakes .
among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .
but the us should also be wary , they caution , of half-cocked measures that unintentionally undermine security - and make such attacks a bit more likely . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.09.2008 film about thalidomide victims breaks emotional taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobody 's perfect in a new documentary called " nobody 's perfect , " twelve ' thalidomiders ' demonstrate that their disabilities are no obstacle to leading a fulfilling life and break a number of emotional taboos in the process . thalidomide was developed by german pharmaceutical company gruenenthal near aachen , and sold from 1957 to 1961 in almost 50 countries to pregnant women to combat morning sickness .
before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 for " confidence building " talks in the light of tensions over issues including the planned us missile shield . during the talks , lavrov said russia did not see a threat from poland , but simply could not ignore a us anti-missile system - to be hosted in poland and the czech republic - so close to its borders .
russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "

in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .

" germany will not shirk its responsibilities in the caucasus conflict , " merkel 's office said , summarizing remarks she made late wednesday at an awards ceremony held by a publishing house .
" about one-fifth of the eu observers in georgia are to come from germany , " the statement added .
merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .
russia , however , will keep 3,800 troops in the two rebel enclaves .
under the peace accord , the eu monitors will remain in the buffer zones between these troops and georgia .
peace plan in doubt ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail saakashvili -lrb- r -rrb- and nicolas sarkozy presenting the cease-fire plan russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility of eu observers gaining access to south ossetia or abkhazia , afp reported .
the move threw into doubt the new peace plan .
" additional international observers will be deployed precisely around south ossetia and abkhazia and not inside these republics , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists in moscow .
sarkozy , speaking at the head of an eu delegation early tuesday alongside georgian president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi , said : " the spirit of the text is that they -lrb- the eu observers -rrb- will have a mandate to enter -lrb- abkhazia and south ossetia -rrb- , to observe , to report . "

" of course we will become part of russia . we 're not intending to set up some independent ossetia , " eduard kokoity had been quoted as saying during a meeting of a kremlin discussion group in the southern russian city of sochi .
however , kokoity soon after denied reports south ossetia hoped to join russia , interfax later reported .
" obviously , i was misunderstood , " he said less than an hour after he was quoted by news agencies as saying " without a doubt we will become part of russia , " news agency dpa reported .
speaking later , kokoity said : " we are not going to refuse the independence which has come to us through enormous sacrifice , and south ossetia is not going to become part of russia , " dpa reported .
interfax quoted kokoity as saying that the region - the site of last month 's war between russia and georgia - - intends to unite with north ossetia , across the border in russia .
russia has already recognized south ossetia as an independent nation , along with abkhazia .
policeman killed on wednesday , georgia reported one of its policemen was shot dead from a russian position in violation of the fragile truce , as a major crack appeared in the eu-brokered ceasefire over the remit of eu observers .
the georgians said it was the first fatal shooting since the august 12 ceasefire that brought an end to the five-day war between georgia and russia over georgia 's breakaway region of south ossetia .
georgia 's interior ministry told afp the officer died in hospital from wounds to the head and throat after being fired on near karaleti , a key russian position on the road from the georgian city of gori to south ossetia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "
referring to recent threats that deploying the system would make poland a military target , sikorski added that russian generals should " weigh their words more , so they do n't needlessly frighten europe . "
us presidential hopefuls wo n't target russia : sikorski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us presidential candidate barack obama says he would n't target russia sikorski said he hoped that , in time , russian worries over the system will subside .
he said both us presidential candidates have said the system is not targeted at russia , and poland will act in a " transparent way " to build trust between the nations .
us democratic presidential contender barack obama has said he will only proceed with installing a us missile shield base in poland if it does not target russia , poland 's foreign minister said thursday .
" in talks with me , senator obama made the realisation of our -lrb- missile shield -rrb- agreement conditional on whether he will be certain that the system is not aimed against russia , " radoslaw sikorski said at a joint press conference in warsaw with russian counterpart sergei larvov .
" in a mini-military briefing given before yesterday to senator mccain in which i participated , i can say that what the candidate was told about the purpose of the -lrb- missile shield -rrb- system has nothing to do with russia , " sikorski said of a consultation with the republican presidential candidate john mccain .
" so we hope that russian fears over this agreement , will dissipate with time , " sikorski said .
russian security still threatened : lavrov bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov charges that us missile shield targets russia " we do not see any threat from poland , but we have said there are risks to the security of the russian federation that are occurring as a result of american infrastructure coming closer to our borders , " lavrov said .
in an article published in polish news media thursday , lavrov said the us missile shield planned for poland and the czech republic targets russia , rather than any potential threat from iran .
" a simple military analysis proves that a us base in europe for global anti-missile defence has no other , and for many years will have no other , target but russian missiles , " lavrov wrote in the gazeta wyborcza newspaper .
" all objective experts understand that iran 's missiles pose no threat to europe and even less to the united states . "
lavrov in an article published earlier in a polish daily wrote that russia was ready to talk about the missile shield as long as the guarantees were n't " empty political gestures . "
" if the us and poland are really interested in guaranteeing that the european anti-missile base wo n't be aimed against russia , then we , like up until now , are ready to consider their concrete proposals , " he said .
lavrov 's was the first visit by a senior official since the recent conflict with georgia .
he was slated to meet with prime minister donald tusk later thursday .
washington 's plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us says its missile system will guard against rogue states like iran poland and the united states signed a deal on august 14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
the united states contends that the shield - endorsed by nato leaders in february - is to fend off potential missile attacks by " rogue states " such as iran , and that it is not aimed at russia .
poland also drew russia 's anger by leading several former eastern bloc countries in calling for a tough eu stance against russia over the latter 's conduct in a brief conflict with georgia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .
seven years later we are unfortunately still a long way off . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .
but the us should also be wary , they caution , of half-cocked measures that unintentionally undermine security - and make such attacks a bit more likely . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.09.2008 experts : less is sometimes more in fight against terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ground zero remains a symbol of the need for targeted security measures as the world marks the seventh anniversary of 9/11 , some european experts say security improvements in the us have been undercut by fairly basic mistakes .
among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .

10 .
his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .
a new world order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's visit to germany earlier this year was controversial but in hamburg this week , steinmeier chose to stress china 's progress .
speaking at the opening of the summit , he hailed the country 's growing role on the international stage .
" we are seeking a new world order , " he said .
" new political and economic centers of powers are emerging , and china is one of them . "
without dialogue with these emerging nations , including brazil , russia and india as well as china , a new world order would be hard to establish , he went on .
current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "
zhang is set to stay in germany until friday .
along with his political meetings , he is expected to visit companies including volkswagen , airbus , thyssen-krupp , basf and deutsche bahn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .
this makes germans some of the strongest migration groups in denmark , luxemburg , the netherlands , austria , poland and switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .

russia believed the anti-missile shield to be an " integral part " of a planned us system throughout the globe and in space , lavrov said .
" the us is currently working on a global lightning strike project , " against which numerous countries and several eu nations have spoken out , he said .
for his part , sikorski said the meeting helped him " better understand " the russian stance .
while poland will continue to speak out on russian issues to the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and the north atlantic treaty organization , it wanted to speak " in a balanced way , based on good knowledge of the russian federation 's views and intentions . "

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .
10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 .
his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .
a new world order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's visit to germany earlier this year was controversial but in hamburg this week , steinmeier chose to stress china 's progress .
speaking at the opening of the summit , he hailed the country 's growing role on the international stage .
" we are seeking a new world order , " he said .
" new political and economic centers of powers are emerging , and china is one of them . "
without dialogue with these emerging nations , including brazil , russia and india as well as china , a new world order would be hard to establish , he went on .
current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "
zhang is set to stay in germany until friday .
along with his political meetings , he is expected to visit companies including volkswagen , airbus , thyssen-krupp , basf and deutsche bahn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking later , kokoity said : " we are not going to refuse the independence which has come to us through enormous sacrifice , and south ossetia is not going to become part of russia , " dpa reported .
interfax quoted kokoity as saying that the region - the site of last month 's war between russia and georgia - - intends to unite with north ossetia , across the border in russia .

policeman killed on wednesday , georgia reported one of its policemen was shot dead from a russian position in violation of the fragile truce , as a major crack appeared in the eu-brokered ceasefire over the remit of eu observers .

georgia 's interior ministry told afp the officer died in hospital from wounds to the head and throat after being fired on near karaleti , a key russian position on the road from the georgian city of gori to south ossetia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have a contract and we are striving for an appropriate fulfilment of this contract , eads chief louis gallois said .
" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .
a german human rights group , the society for threatened peoples , criticized zhang 's visit , charging that as a senior official he was associated with humans-rights breaches in shanghai .
earlier this year , the german media was critical of china 's actions in tibet and steinmeier phoned beijing to voice concerns and urge talks with the dalai lama , the tibetans ' spiritual leader .
a new world order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama 's visit to germany earlier this year was controversial but in hamburg this week , steinmeier chose to stress china 's progress .
speaking at the opening of the summit , he hailed the country 's growing role on the international stage .
" we are seeking a new world order , " he said .
" new political and economic centers of powers are emerging , and china is one of them . "
without dialogue with these emerging nations , including brazil , russia and india as well as china , a new world order would be hard to establish , he went on .
current problems such as the crisis in world trade talks and the increasing raw materials shortage need to be solved by international cooperation , he said .
steinmeier also praised germany 's newly revived political ties to china after disagreements strained the relationship earlier this year .
a meeting between chancellor angela merkel and the dalai lama in berlin angered the chinese leading to a significant freeze in ties .
" dialogue on human rights has been re-established and meetings between our governments are once again taking place , " he said .
he stressed the importance of continued dialogue , not least with respect to the caucasus conflict .
for his part , zhang dejiang welcomed what he called " a new chapter in relations between china and the eu . "
" china is a partner and not a rival , " he said .
" at this point , the partnership between china and the eu has reached a mature stage … .current global crises can only be surmounted if we join forces . "
zhang is set to stay in germany until friday .
along with his political meetings , he is expected to visit companies including volkswagen , airbus , thyssen-krupp , basf and deutsche bahn . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .

born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .

it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .

his visit to germany is the first high-level visit since china 's controversial crackdown in tibet this year .
both also toured the airbus factory in the city where giant airliners are wired up and painted and attended the start of a two-day business meeting dubbed the hamburg summit , which is held every two years .
this year 's event is focusing on environmental issues .
over the next two weeks , hamburg will be holding cultural events marking the 22nd anniversary of its twin-city agreement with the chinese city of shanghai .

the oecd has warned berlin it needs to overhaul its immigration policies to meet the need for workers . germany needs to fix its immigration policy to match its future work-force needs , the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development said in a report on sept .
10 , 2008 .
in 2006 , just 216,000 foreigners settled permanently in germany - that 's 11 percent lower than the previous year - the oecd reported .
the drop stands in stark contrast to the number of permanent immigrants to the entire 30-country oecd region , which rose by 5 percent in the same period .
from low to lower in 2006 , foreign immigration to germany fell yet further from a starting position that was relatively low in the first place , the oecd reported .
only japan , portugal , finland and france had lower rates of permanent foreign immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks are the second-largest immigrant group if the trend continues , the number of employable people in germany will shrink by an estimated 2.5 percent by 2020 , the oecd warned .
in most other industrialized countries , the work-force is expected to grow .
in light of this , the oecd urged germany to update its immigration policy .
this means that not just highly educated workers , but also low-qualified immigrants should be targeted , oecd general secretary angel gurria said .
oecd : avoid short-term solutions demographic change could lead to a lack of workers in many sectors that ca n't be covered with seasonal workers , the report said .
referring pointedly to germany , gurria noted that an immigration policy based on the concept of short-term stays for immigrants is a step in the wrong direction - neither efficient nor practical .
in 2006 , germany hosted 380,000 seasonal and other temporary workers from abroad , nearly double the average number in the oecd .
also , germany lags far behind when it comes to recognizing foreign diplomas and qualifications , according to migration expert thomas liebig .
" there is still a lot of work to do , " liebig said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many immigrant poles work in the building trades the workers most frequently affected come from eastern europe .
it is not only a case of failing to translate higher-education diplomas , but also technical diplomas , he said .
poles are largest immigrant group liebig recommended dealing with this problem by instituting a system of practical examinations that could stand in for diplomas .
according to the study , poles were the largest group of long-term immigrants to germany , at 27 percent .
they were followed by turks -lrb- eight percent -rrb- romanians -lrb- four percent -rrb- , hungarians and italians .
moreover , increasing numbers of germans have emigrated to other oecd countries , particularly countries neighboring germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 11.09.2008 opinion : west needs more than military force in war on terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seven years after the september 11 attacks islamic terrorism is in check , but not defeated .
for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .
seven years later we are unfortunately still a long way off . daniel scheschkewitz is a reporter for dw-radio and deutsche welle 's former washington correspondent -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts : less is sometimes more in fight against terrorism as the world marks the seventh anniversary of 9/11 , some european experts say security improvements in the us have been undercut by fairly basic mistakes .
among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies .
-lrb- 11.09.2008 -rrb- filmmaker urges international tribunal to probe 9/11 italian film-maker giulietto chiesa , who was in berlin for a screening of his documentary which questions the official us version of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , has called for an international tribunal to probe events .

for a lasting victory the west needs more than military success says deutsche welle ’ s daniel scheschkewitz . the shock of september 11 now lies seven years back .
in those seven years the horrible images of the collapsing world trade center have not faded from our memory .
in the usa the victims are not forgotten , even though the country may have changed since the events .
a maximum security mentality has come at the cost of individual freedoms .
out of a free america came the “ security state - made in the usa . ”
like in so many other things , in this case the united states was again an example for other countries asking the question : where do meaningful and necessary measures give way to excesses ?
such excesses could include spying on citizens , more developed methods of close surveillance , security scrutiny of air traffic .
in dealing with prisoners the usa was by no means a role model of respecting human rights - neither in abu ghraib nor in guantanamo .
success against terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz nevertheless , under pressure from the usa , the international community of states undertook formidable efforts to effectively fight organized terrorism , beginning with the war against the taliban in afghanistan .
since then secret service experts take it for granted that an attack on the scale of sep .
11 would at present no longer be possible since the international al-qaeda network has come under constant pressure through successful crackdown initiatives .
the terrorists have had to draw back to their areas of retreat such as the pakistani-afghan border area , where they can only operate very limitedly .
other states , such as libya , have since openly distanced themselves from terrorism and the terrorist networks and financial bases were also at least dried out in countries like yemen , syria and saudi arabia .
war on terror is far from over but there have also been retaliations : in afghanistan the taliban has been gathering strength for some time and has expanded into the formerly relatively peaceful north .
in algeria al-qaeda offshoots are making themselves heard with violent attacks now during ramadan .
supposed allegiances in the fight against terror , such as those with russia or china , have proven frail , especially when ethnic tensions in these regions are met with military brutality under the pretense of fighting terrorism .
furthermore , security experts give cause for concern when they say that terrorists have never been as close to acquiring nuclear weapons as they are today .
either because they are within reach of the remains of the former soviet union arsenal , or because they are being offered atomic know-how or uranium from so-called rogue states like north korea .
but the greatest problem of all is that , with the poverty and lack of prospects in broad levels of the population in many islamic states , the number of potential terror recruits is becoming vast .
every additional unemployed person in afghanistan , who has to feed a family through enforced labor in the opium fields , plays into the hands of the taliban and wears down the isaf force .
only if the west succeeds in improving the basic social requirements in countries such as pakistan or afghanistan can the fight against terror be crowned with lasting success .

" germany will not shirk its responsibilities in the caucasus conflict , " merkel 's office said , summarizing remarks she made late wednesday at an awards ceremony held by a publishing house .
" about one-fifth of the eu observers in georgia are to come from germany , " the statement added .
merkel said the exact division of labor between the european union and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , with their parallel observer missions in georgia still had to be determined .
in talks with french president nicolas sarkozy in moscow on monday , russian president dmitry medvedev committed to withdraw within a month all russian troops from georgia apart from those in the breakaway regions of south ossetia and abkhazia , and to allow the deployment of the 200 eu observers .
russia , however , will keep 3,800 troops in the two rebel enclaves .
under the peace accord , the eu monitors will remain in the buffer zones between these troops and georgia .
peace plan in doubt ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail saakashvili -lrb- r -rrb- and nicolas sarkozy presenting the cease-fire plan russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility of eu observers gaining access to south ossetia or abkhazia , afp reported .
the move threw into doubt the new peace plan .
" additional international observers will be deployed precisely around south ossetia and abkhazia and not inside these republics , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists in moscow .
sarkozy , speaking at the head of an eu delegation early tuesday alongside georgian president mikheil saakashvili in tbilisi , said : " the spirit of the text is that they -lrb- the eu observers -rrb- will have a mandate to enter -lrb- abkhazia and south ossetia -rrb- , to observe , to report . "
south ossetian leader flip-flops over province joining russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity has flip-flopped on south ossetia 's joining russian federation south ossetia 's separatist leader early thursday , sept .
11 , had said that his breakaway region intends to become part of russia , interfax news agency had reported .
" of course we will become part of russia . we 're not intending to set up some independent ossetia , " eduard kokoity had been quoted as saying during a meeting of a kremlin discussion group in the southern russian city of sochi .
however , kokoity soon after denied reports south ossetia hoped to join russia , interfax later reported .
" obviously , i was misunderstood , " he said less than an hour after he was quoted by news agencies as saying " without a doubt we will become part of russia , " news agency dpa reported .
speaking later , kokoity said : " we are not going to refuse the independence which has come to us through enormous sacrifice , and south ossetia is not going to become part of russia , " dpa reported .
interfax quoted kokoity as saying that the region - the site of last month 's war between russia and georgia - - intends to unite with north ossetia , across the border in russia .
russia has already recognized south ossetia as an independent nation , along with abkhazia .
policeman killed on wednesday , georgia reported one of its policemen was shot dead from a russian position in violation of the fragile truce , as a major crack appeared in the eu-brokered ceasefire over the remit of eu observers .
the georgians said it was the first fatal shooting since the august 12 ceasefire that brought an end to the five-day war between georgia and russia over georgia 's breakaway region of south ossetia .
georgia 's interior ministry told afp the officer died in hospital from wounds to the head and throat after being fired on near karaleti , a key russian position on the road from the georgian city of gori to south ossetia . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .
there was no allowance for inflation and by the mid-1990s , the company 's contribution had run out .
sebastian wirtz has said that the company has voluntarily offered to increase its contribution and supports the government in its promise to double the payouts . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .
" we are all aware that what is happening in the region is a matter which concerns humanity as a whole . "
international cooperation needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several nations have political , economic and environmental concerns in the arctic russia , usa , canada , norway and denmark , through greenland , are the five coastal arctic states with territorial and historical ties to the arctic ocean .
the arctic council also includes finland , iceland and sweden .
the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .
" melting ice offers new opportunities for exploring and exploiting natural resources in the arctic , " he said , adding that it " also opens opportunities for increased shipping in the northwest and northeast passages . "
as the ice melts , more of the sea will be accessible for off-shore drilling and gas exploration in the arctic seabed , but drilling for natural resources is detrimental to the natural environment , said martin sommerkorn , a senior climate change advisor for the wwf 's international arctic program .

a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "

" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .

not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .

they called for the harmonizing of international arctic policies . the conference aimed to increase awareness of how european union policy affect conditions in the arctic and around the rest of the world , according to halldor asgrimsson , secretary-general of the nordic council of ministers .
scientists have said the arctic climate is warming at twice the rate as the rest of the planet .
laurent stefanini , one of the european union 's representatives to the meeting of nordic countries and nations that border the arctic ocean , called climate change is one of the top priorities of the french eu presidency . "
" what we clearly need is a shared vision of the issues at stake , of the policies to face them in a region which is particularly sensitive to the impact of man 's influence on his environment , " said stefanini , france 's ambassador for the environment .

the nations were hoping to coordinate international arctic policy , which includes foreign , shipping , environmental and maritime aspects .
the eu needs to develop international policy options for supporting adaptation in the marine arctic environment as well as addressing major climate issues facing the region , according to ralph czarnekci , a senior fellow with the institute for international and european environmental policy .

gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .

" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .

before its release , inadequate tests were performed to assess the drug 's safety , with catastrophic results for the children of women who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancies .
marketed as " as harmless as a sugar cube , " the thalidomide drug caused around 10,000 babies around the world to be born with disabilities , 4000 of them in germany .
shame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niko von glasow filmmaker niko von glasow was one of them .
born in cologne in 1960 , he spent years struggling to come to terms with his condition - feeling too ashamed of his short arms even to wear a bathing suit .
but then the former production assistant to legendary german director rainer werner fassbinder decided to go on the offensive .
he came up with the idea of publishing a volume of nude portraits of thalidomide-impaired people , and making a film about the process .
" nobody 's perfect " hits german cinema screens on sept .
11 .
it charts his search for eleven protagonists and his efforts to persuade them to pose naked for photographs .
as a thalidomide victim himself , von glasow felt confident asking questions many other directors would have steered clear of , treating his characters with a refreshing candor and never patronizing them .
" i tried not to be voyeuristic , " he said in an interview with stern magazine .
" it could have been a freak show , so it was important to ensure the protagonists kept their dignity . "
intriguing characters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4000 thalidomide babies were born in germany as the title suggests , " nobody 's perfect " is a film that sets out to celebrate difference .
" if people are going to stare , then i should at least give them something to stare at , " the director has said .
it did n't take him too long to find his volunteers .
coming from diverse backgrounds such as politics , media , sport , astrophysics and acting , what links them is an acceptance of their condition and a refusal to let it stand in their way .
nonetheless , the film does not shy away from depicting the difficulties faced by thalidomide victims , from bullying in the schoolyard to prejudice even from adults in their professional lives. von glasow 's trump card is that he can approach the subject with the sort of humor that might have been seen as inappropriate from any other director .
" -lrb- the audience -rrb- are finally given a chance to laugh at situations that they want to laugh at , but have never been allowed to , " he told stern .
the beauty of imperfection the film also shows how their participation in the project proved to be a learning experience for the protagonists , not least due to von glasow 's probing questions about everything from sex to depression. von glasow has said that he hopes the portraits reveal the beauty of imperfection , and helped organize a public exhibition of the photographs in cologne last month .
" the film brought me out of myself , " he told stern .
" no therapy propels you straight into nirvana , but i feel one step closer . "
compensation claims bildunterschrift : getting stared at is part of life the documentary follows his attempts to confront the wirtz family , the owners of the gruenenthal company , with one of his photographs .
they never return his calls .
victims have long been campaigning for greater compensation from the german manufacturer .
in 1972 , gruenenthal paid 110million deutschmarks into a fund , held by the german contergan trust , which was matched by the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 11.09.2008 experts : less is sometimes more in fight against terrorism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ground zero remains a symbol of the need for targeted security measures as the world marks the seventh anniversary of 9/11 , some european experts say security improvements in the us have been undercut by fairly basic mistakes .
among the remedies is more trust in america 's laws and allies . seven years after the attacks on new york and washington of september 11 , 2001 , america is more divided than ever before about the effectiveness of the bush administration 's response to islamic terrorism .
a few americans have even dared to question whether fear of al qaeda has not been grotesquely exaggerated - pointing out the extreme statistical unlikelihood of dying from an act of terrorism outside of iraq or afghanistan .
so do terrorism experts from europe , which is often accused of anti-americanism , share the view that the bush administration has been creating , perhaps consciously exploiting needless angst ?
big bangs and trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heightened airport security is a reality - but is it always rational ?
not at all , says professor paul wilkinson , the recently retired director of the center for the study of terrorism and political violence at the university of st. andrews in scotland .
" i think most people now have a fairly balanced view because they realize that major terrorist attacks in western countries do n't happen all that often , and the frequency of deaths in traffic accidents is far greater , " wilkinson told dw-world.de.
" but assaults of that kind are hardly a minor matter , and i would also say america is relatively safer now than it was at the time of 9/11 due to things like better airline security , " wilkinson added .
ralf tophoven , co-director of the iftus institute for terrorism research and security policies in essen , germany , agrees that there are reasons to fear 9/11-style attacks - even if there have n't been any on us soil in seven years .
" al qaeda clearly wants a ' big bang ' in the us , something with comparable dimensions , " tophoven told dw-world.de.
" they 're not interested in killing three people in the new york subway , however terrible that might also be on a human level . "
but tophoven added that the current us government 's policies have not always been rational .
" i think the bush administration was traumatized by terrorism , " tophoven said .
" and a lot of measures , such as guantanamo , were over-exaggerated because of that trauma . "
harmful diversions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many think the us would have been better served sticking to its own legal system wilkinson also sees the circumvention of the america legal system as one of two major blunders .
" a country that was always known for its pride in its justice system , which does n't follow those principles when dealing with al qaeda suspects , weakens its credibility in the eyes of many in the muslim world , " wilkinson said .
and the iraq war , he insists , was a diversion of resources that should have gone toward afghanistan - and that ultimately strengthened al qaeda 's hand .
" it gave them a tremendous propaganda boost because they could say ' look , we are the true defenders of islam , " ' wilkinson said .
" they used it for recruiting and raising more funds , and the conflict in iraq gave them a huge variety of targets . "
tophoven also stresses the need for global thinking in the campaign against terrorism , including greater cooperation with and trust in europe .
" because of europe 's large muslim populations , even if 99 percent are peaceful , we have much more potential for homegrown terrorists , " tophoven pointed out .
" but german authorities sometimes ca n't prosecute terror suspects because us intelligence withholds necessary evidence for reasons of national security . "
size is n't everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america can not battle terrorism without europe - and vice versa the two experts also warn against territorial competition and too much information-gathering .
" all the nato countries have had problems coordinating the work of their intelligence agencies , including the work of those agencies with the police , " wilkinson said .
" the ' spooks ' and the ' cops ' have traditionally been at arm 's length . "
and tophoven cites the negative example of the east german secret police that became paralyzed in the final days of the communist gdr because they had collected too much information about possible threats .
" they choked on the volume of data , " he said .
" the more data you collect , the more sensitive you have to be in interpreting it . "
he says america should beware of falling into that trap .
" the danger is that the department of homeland security becomes a similarly bloated state apparatus , " tophoven warned .
" instead they should look to the mossad in israel as an example of ' small but effective . " '
seven years on from 9/11 , america should still be wary of large-scale al qaeda attacks , they say .
but the us should also be wary , they caution , of half-cocked measures that unintentionally undermine security - and make such attacks a bit more likely . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we believe that the kc-45 is the best tanker for the us military and we stand behind our partner northrop-grumman , " he said .
gallois calls for continuation of contract saying that eads had not been given any detailed information from the us air force or northrop-grumman , gallois said the contract for the refuelling planes was still valid and should be fulfilled .
the us defense department announced it would cancel the competition , between boeing and a eads-northrop partnership - on wednesday , sept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads ' gallois : ' we have a contract ' eads said it would not have any ramifications on the company 's operating result because the contract was not included in the planning .
the pentagon on wednesday notified congress of the plans to scrap the competition after us defense secretary robert gates determined it was too politically charged and could n't be completed before president george w. bush 's administration ends in january .
gates : mistakes were made gates issued a statement acknowledging the pentagon 's mistakes in managing the lengthy competition that was thrown into disarray in june , when a congressional oversight agency upheld a boeing protest and ruled the air force erred in awarding the contract to northrop-eads .
the next administration will be better suited to handle the contract objectively , gates said .
" over the past seven years the process has become enormously complex and emotional - in no small part because of mistakes and missteps along the way by the department of defense , " gates said .
the congressional oversight agency the government accountability office in june concluded the pentagon should start a new competition after determining the boeing proposal was not fairly reviewed when the contract was awarded to northrop and eads in february .
in july , gates announced he had accepted the gao 's findings and would rehold the competition to build the 179 kc-x tankers .
the contract was the first of three that , when combined , could reach a value of $ 100 billion over 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates says time has run out for bidders under bush " this will assure delivery of the right tanker to the air force and serve the best interests of the american taxpayer , " boeing said .
pentagon wants ' cooling off period ' the contract was the focus of intense political scrutiny from members of congress who opposed handing the contract to a european firm at a time when the us economy was struggling .
congressional battle lines were drawn between members whose districts would have benefited from a boeing award and those aligned with northrop-eads .
eadsplanned on building a factory in alabama to assemble the aircraft from components manufactured in europe .
" it is my judgment that in the time remaining to us , we can no longer complete a competition that would be viewed as fair and objective in this highly charged environment , " gates said .
" the resulting ' cooling off ' period will allow the next administration to review objectively the military requirements and craft a new acquisition strategy for the kc-x , " gates said . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the winds of change reach even the remotest parts of the country ... the village of klein vielen lies in the north of what used to be east germany .
the fall of the berlin wall and the opening of the inner-german border made a resounding thud here .
a way of life and much of the sense of security that came with it vanished along with the dictatorial state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klein vielen cameraman pitt venherm documented the transition from one era to another in this corner of mecklenburg-vorpommern .
almost 20 years later , he has returned with the reporter dieter roser to meet and speak with the same people again .
but in many ways , they are not the same , at all .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk evert , sigmar hartz and lothar brandt reminisce the agricultural production cooperative , the apc , once dominated village life in klein vielen .
it provided jobs that the people here thought were secure for life .
now , the apc no longer exists .
in its place is a private farmers ' cooperative that works almost the same vast area of cropland with state-of-the-art machinery and a fraction of the workforce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar hartz back on top of his combine before re-unification in 1990 , sigmar hartz had worked for the apc as a " tractorist " or " harvest captain " , as combine drivers were known in socialist jargon .
the fall of the wall opened the way for him to fulfill a dream and become a truck driver - a dream that did n't last .
today , he 's back on top of his combine , bringing in klein vielen 's 2008 harvest .
" everything - our whole life has changed since the fall of the wall " , he confirms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut lembke as an apc department head in 1990 barely 30 years old at the time of germany 's re-unification , hartmut lembke was a department head for the apc .
he has been through good times and bad in the years since then .
now he works on a hotel ship , guiding danish tourists around his home region in mecklenburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut lembke shows tourists around his home region in mecklenburg hartmut lembke stresses that he still sees himself as an " east german " .
even so , he would n't want the wall back - " now you can travel anywhere you like .
but in east german days , that was not possible " .
and then there 's olaf schultz , who rose from a farmhand on the apc to become a successful hauling contractor - and on the other side of the coin , ulrike böker , who promptly lost her job as " tractorist " upon re-unification and has yet to find another in any line of work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their consume store was once the center of village life : inge and georg mittelstädt klein vielen 's own " whole life has changed since the fall of the wall " .
before , the consume store was where everyone came to shop and catch up on the gossip .
but the consume closed long ago , and its operators , inge and georg mittelstädt , are long since retired .
they have a wealth of memories that they are quite willing to share .
the people of klein vielen gather at the annual village festival and revive a feeling of community between them that many seem to have lost in their daily lives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge and georg mittelstädt today this two-part documentary intercuts video footage from 1990 and new material .
it captures the former east german countryside in tasteful , contemplative images that provide insight into and speak volumes about east-west sensibilities - and even more about the people , their hopes , disappointments , happiness and sufferings .

it will be great if young people had the chance to make healthy dishes from basic ingredients at home , not simply in the classroom – as i did when i was growing up " ed balls , schools secretary schools secretary ed balls said everyone should be able to prepare basic , nutritious dishes from scratch instead of " taking pride " in not being able to cook properly .
" too many people just accept they can not cook or simply do not have time for it , " he said .
" we 've lost touch with making basic dishes from scratch , even though there has never been a wider range of food in our shops .
' real meals ' the recipes are also on the teachernet website " schools are only part of the solution - at the end of the day parents bring up children , not teachers .
" it will be great if young people had the chance to make healthy dishes from basic ingredients at home , not simply in the classroom – as i did when i was growing up . "
the government announced in january that from 2011 it would be compulsory for 11- to 14-year-olds to have food technology lessons , including hands-on practical cooking classes .
cookery is already compulsory in primary schools .
money being announced will be used to equip the 515 secondary schools which do not have cooking facilities .

plaid ministers will tell the party 's autumn conference in aberystwyth that the assembly government coalition with labour is working well .
key party figures will say plaid is both creating a new agenda for wales and winning people 's trust .
gordon brown will be challenged to call a general election , with plaid confident of getting more mps elected .
opening the conference , rural affairs minister elin jones will say the party is the " dynamic and progressive force " in welsh politics .
ms jones will assure delegates that plaid 's principles have not been compromised by being in government .
on friday , party leader and deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones will reject claims that a referendum on further assembly powers will not be held on or before the next assembly election in 2011 .
mr jones is expected to say that if there is support for full law-making powers " then it should happen " and suggest that a " new confidence in wales " could help the process .
over the first 14 months of political marriage to labour in cardiff bay , there have been some difficult moments along the way for the junior partner .
morale although it lost control of gwynedd council in this year 's local elections , plaid is confident its record number of councillors , 206 , demonstrates that being in coalition in cardiff bay is not damaging the party 's identity .
labour mp don touhig 's intervention to claim that plaid was " running rings around labour " in the assembly government was also a bit of a morale boost from a surprise source .
a clear low point was the resignation of plaid culture minister rhodri glyn thomas over the summer .
he quit following claims he walked into a pub with a lit cigar , just weeks after announcing the wrong winner of the wales book of the year on thursday his replacement , alun ffred jones will outline his vision of the job , and attempt to allay concerns about progress of measures to strengthen the welsh language .
he is expected to stress that his priority is to ensure that people are free to speak the language in their everyday life .
new technology despite the inevitable excitement about assembly matters , plaid parliamentary leader , elfyn llywd , will warn the party not to take its eye off the westminster ball .
he will say the team there is ready for a general election and confident it can increase its number of mps .

reports of the problem first emerged on wednesday , when 14 babies in gansu province were said to have become ill .
according to xinhua news agency , similar cases have now appeared in northern , eastern and central china .
one baby has reportedly died , but officials have not yet drawn a clear link with the milk powder in this case .
the babies in gansu had all been fed milk powder bearing the label of the sanlu group , but a spokesperson for sanlu insisted that any substandard milk would have produced by counterfeiters .
nationwide problem " it is extremely rare for babies to get kidney stones , let alone so many getting them all at the same time , " said zhang wei , chief urologist at the gansu hospital where the 14 babies are being treated .
he told the china daily newspaper that it was possible more babies in the area could have been taken ill , but high medical costs might have deterred parents from coming for treatment .
xinhua reported on thursday that other cases had emerged in the provinces of jiangsu , shandong , ningxia , shaanxi , anhui and hunan .
a fake milk powder scandal in 2004 killed at least 13 babies in the eastern province of anhui .

passionato is providing the world 's biggest collection of high-quality classical downloads , first in the uk and later worldwide .
the company says more than 18,000 recordings are available .
many fans of classical music have previously shunned mp3 downloads because of disappointing quality .
passionato offers its downloads - single tracks , works or albums - at high-quality 320kbps mp3 or lossless flac -lrb- free lossless audio codec -rrb- .
major labels all are free from digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- which means they can be transferred to any computer or portable music players including the ipod and be burnt to a cd .
the website provides access to catalogues from major classical labels as well as key independent labels and there are plans to sign up more labels and add new releases on a weekly basis .
passionato 's founder is james glicker , a veteran of the music industry and a former president of the baltimore symphony orchestra .
he told the bbc that although it did its early research in the us , it chose to launch in the uk for two reasons .
" first , the uk and europe have an incredibly vibrant classical music scene in terms of concert attendance , record labels and journalism - though of course the us is the biggest single country in terms of actual classical music sales , " he said .
" second , the uk has several innovative entities that sponsor creative projects , including the creative capital fund , which invested in passionato .
so another reason for setting up passionato in the uk is to take advantage of the financial support that was being offered to us . "
he described classical music aficionados - of which he is one - as " a fastidious lot " who had been slow to switch to digital because of the relatively poor quality of compressed files .
" online music stores have typically offered mp3s at 128kbps , ie very compressed files , which is fine for pop music but it 's not exactly high-fidelity , " he said .
" there are a handful of online stores currently offering small catalogues of classical music at 320kbps .
this is high quality audio and our research tells us people ca n't readily distinguish between 320kbps mp3s and cd quality wavs .
we are offering 320kpbs and also lossless flac . "
passionato will face competition from established online classical music stores such as eclassical as well as from large download stores such as itunes which have some classical works in their catalogues .
retailers closing mr glicker said he hoped passionato would boost the classical music industry .
" this is a major motivation for us , " he said .
" it 's ironic that while classical music concert attendance is on the rise , labels are reducing their recordings and physical retailers are shutting down like there is no tomorrow .
" so the future of classical music distribution is online .
the only thing that has stopped this inevitable shift from happening to date has been audio quality , plus the drm issue . "
the bpi , the uk 's recorded music industry association , issued a statement welcoming the launch .
" digital distribution already offers great choice as to how music fans can access and enjoy music online , and its potential is even greater .
we expect the new passionato service will greatly enhance the digital music offering for classical music aficionados and we warmly welcome innovation of this type in music retail . "
visitors to the passionato online store can listen to 60-second samples before deciding whether to buy a track .
a free music player and organiser is also available for download .
as part of the launch , anyone registering at passionato.com can claim 10 free pre-selected tracks including a 30-minute work .

founder james glicker hopes to boost the classical music industry " first , the uk and europe have an incredibly vibrant classical music scene in terms of concert attendance , record labels and journalism - though of course the us is the biggest single country in terms of actual classical music sales , " he said .
" second , the uk has several innovative entities that sponsor creative projects , including the creative capital fund , which invested in passionato .
so another reason for setting up passionato in the uk is to take advantage of the financial support that was being offered to us . "
he described classical music aficionados - of which he is one - as " a fastidious lot " who had been slow to switch to digital because of the relatively poor quality of compressed files .
" online music stores have typically offered mp3s at 128kbps , ie very compressed files , which is fine for pop music but it 's not exactly high-fidelity , " he said .
" there are a handful of online stores currently offering small catalogues of classical music at 320kbps .
this is high quality audio and our research tells us people ca n't readily distinguish between 320kbps mp3s and cd quality wavs .
we are offering 320kpbs and also lossless flac . "
passionato will face competition from established online classical music stores such as eclassical as well as from large download stores such as itunes which have some classical works in their catalogues .
retailers closing mr glicker said he hoped passionato would boost the classical music industry .
" this is a major motivation for us , " he said .
" it 's ironic that while classical music concert attendance is on the rise , labels are reducing their recordings and physical retailers are shutting down like there is no tomorrow .
" so the future of classical music distribution is online .
the only thing that has stopped this inevitable shift from happening to date has been audio quality , plus the drm issue . "
the bpi , the uk 's recorded music industry association , issued a statement welcoming the launch .
" digital distribution already offers great choice as to how music fans can access and enjoy music online , and its potential is even greater .
we expect the new passionato service will greatly enhance the digital music offering for classical music aficionados and we warmly welcome innovation of this type in music retail . "
visitors to the passionato online store can listen to 60-second samples before deciding whether to buy a track .
a free music player and organiser is also available for download .
as part of the launch , anyone registering at passionato.com can claim 10 free pre-selected tracks including a 30-minute work .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- classical download store launches british broadcasting corporation home accessibility links mobile version skip to content skip to local navigation skip to bbc.co.uk navigation skip to bbc.co.uk search help accessibility help bbc news updated every minute of every day one-minute world news news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog bbc world service page last updated at 07:46 gmt , thursday , 11 september 2008 08:46 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version classical download store launches drm-free tracks mean music can be transferred to other audio devices classical music lovers in the uk will now be able to download their favourite works from the web , thanks to a new resource launched today .
passionato is providing the world 's biggest collection of high-quality classical downloads , first in the uk and later worldwide .
the company says more than 18,000 recordings are available .
many fans of classical music have previously shunned mp3 downloads because of disappointing quality .
passionato offers its downloads - single tracks , works or albums - at high-quality 320kbps mp3 or lossless flac -lrb- free lossless audio codec -rrb- .
major labels all are free from digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- which means they can be transferred to any computer or portable music players including the ipod and be burnt to a cd .
the website provides access to catalogues from major classical labels as well as key independent labels and there are plans to sign up more labels and add new releases on a weekly basis .
passionato 's founder is james glicker , a veteran of the music industry and a former president of the baltimore symphony orchestra .
he told the bbc that although it did its early research in the us , it chose to launch in the uk for two reasons .
founder james glicker hopes to boost the classical music industry " first , the uk and europe have an incredibly vibrant classical music scene in terms of concert attendance , record labels and journalism - though of course the us is the biggest single country in terms of actual classical music sales , " he said .
" second , the uk has several innovative entities that sponsor creative projects , including the creative capital fund , which invested in passionato .
so another reason for setting up passionato in the uk is to take advantage of the financial support that was being offered to us . "
he described classical music aficionados - of which he is one - as " a fastidious lot " who had been slow to switch to digital because of the relatively poor quality of compressed files .
" online music stores have typically offered mp3s at 128kbps , ie very compressed files , which is fine for pop music but it 's not exactly high-fidelity , " he said .
" there are a handful of online stores currently offering small catalogues of classical music at 320kbps .
this is high quality audio and our research tells us people ca n't readily distinguish between 320kbps mp3s and cd quality wavs .
we are offering 320kpbs and also lossless flac . "
passionato will face competition from established online classical music stores such as eclassical as well as from large download stores such as itunes which have some classical works in their catalogues .
retailers closing mr glicker said he hoped passionato would boost the classical music industry .
" this is a major motivation for us , " he said .
" it 's ironic that while classical music concert attendance is on the rise , labels are reducing their recordings and physical retailers are shutting down like there is no tomorrow .
" so the future of classical music distribution is online .
the only thing that has stopped this inevitable shift from happening to date has been audio quality , plus the drm issue . "
the bpi , the uk 's recorded music industry association , issued a statement welcoming the launch .
" digital distribution already offers great choice as to how music fans can access and enjoy music online , and its potential is even greater .
we expect the new passionato service will greatly enhance the digital music offering for classical music aficionados and we warmly welcome innovation of this type in music retail . "
visitors to the passionato online store can listen to 60-second samples before deciding whether to buy a track .
a free music player and organiser is also available for download .
as part of the launch , anyone registering at passionato.com can claim 10 free pre-selected tracks including a 30-minute work .

advertisement discovery of the world 's rarest tree frog is caught on camera an extremely rare female frog has been spotted for the first time in 20 years .
the tiny tree frog , isthmohyla rivularis , was seen in costa rica 's monteverde cloud forest preserve .
this species was thought to have become extinct two decades ago , but last year a university of manchester researcher caught a glimpse of a male .
however , the discovery of the female and more males suggests this species is breeding and has been able to survive where many other frogs have not .
andrew gray , a herpetologist from manchester museum at the university of manchester , said : " this has been the highlight of the whole of my career .
the only time you ever come across a female is by chance andrew gray " now that we know that both sexes exist in the wild , we should intensify efforts to understand their ecology and further their conservation . "
the bbc has been following the team from the university of manchester and chester zoo that is working on amphibian conservation programmes the bbc video of the frog is the first-known footage of this species .
the 2.5cm-long female , which was released after the discovery , was brown with metallic green speckles and was packed full of eggs .
a difficult task finding female frogs is extremely difficult ; males make a distinctive call but females are silent for most of the time .
and tracking down this particular species in a great expanse of rainforest was even more difficult - the team had few clues about where the frogs might be , and the search could only take place at night .
the team trekked deep into the forest to a spot close to where the male isthmohyla rivularis was spotted last year .
the researchers first discovered another male from its soft insect-like call .
the conservationists then trained their torches on the undergrowth , and eventually luis obando , head of park maintenance at monteverde 's tropical science center , found the tiny female , which was sitting on a leaf .
mr gray told the bbc : " it is hard to describe just how unlikely it was to have discovered a female of this particular species .
" the only time you ever come across a female is by chance - and it is only once in a blue moon that they come down to lay their eggs .
you really have to be in the right place at the right time .
" you could come out here every night for a year and not see a thing .
" i really think that this time we have had luck on our side . "

advertisement rare male frog filmed the discovery of both sexes of this species has given the researchers hope that this population may be surviving against the odds .
mr gray explained : " last year , when we saw the male , we had no idea whether this was one of the last few remaining male specimens of this species .
" but now we have found the female , there is hope that the species may recover .
" it still seems that these critically endangered creatures are on the very brink of extinction - and although we have been intensively searching the streams all through the night , it appears that the density of the population is precarious . "
the researchers swabbed the frogs before they were released to see if they are carrying the chytrid fungus - a disease thought to have killed of many other species in this area .
they also used a spectrometer to look at the properties of the frogs ' skin to try to find out why this species has survived where others have not .
" it is imperative for the future conservation of costa rican amphibians that collaborative efforts harness the skills of biologists , researchers , educators and committed individuals , if we are to save these rare species , " mr gray added .

advertisement discovery of the world 's rarest tree frog is caught on camera an extremely rare female frog has been spotted for the first time in 20 years .
the tiny tree frog , isthmohyla rivularis , was seen in costa rica 's monteverde cloud forest preserve .
this species was thought to have become extinct two decades ago , but last year a university of manchester researcher caught a glimpse of a male .
however , the discovery of the female and more males suggests this species is breeding and has been able to survive where many other frogs have not .
andrew gray , a herpetologist from manchester museum at the university of manchester , said : " this has been the highlight of the whole of my career .
the only time you ever come across a female is by chance andrew gray " now that we know that both sexes exist in the wild , we should intensify efforts to understand their ecology and further their conservation . "
the bbc has been following the team from the university of manchester and chester zoo that is working on amphibian conservation programmes the bbc video of the frog is the first-known footage of this species .
the 2.5cm-long female , which was released after the discovery , was brown with metallic green speckles and was packed full of eggs .
a difficult task finding female frogs is extremely difficult ; males make a distinctive call but females are silent for most of the time .
and tracking down this particular species in a great expanse of rainforest was even more difficult - the team had few clues about where the frogs might be , and the search could only take place at night .
the team trekked deep into the forest to a spot close to where the male isthmohyla rivularis was spotted last year .
the researchers first discovered another male from its soft insect-like call .
the conservationists then trained their torches on the undergrowth , and eventually luis obando , head of park maintenance at monteverde 's tropical science center , found the tiny female , which was sitting on a leaf .
mr gray told the bbc : " it is hard to describe just how unlikely it was to have discovered a female of this particular species .
" the only time you ever come across a female is by chance - and it is only once in a blue moon that they come down to lay their eggs .
you really have to be in the right place at the right time .
" you could come out here every night for a year and not see a thing .
" i really think that this time we have had luck on our side . "

advertisement rare male frog filmed the discovery of both sexes of this species has given the researchers hope that this population may be surviving against the odds .
mr gray explained : " last year , when we saw the male , we had no idea whether this was one of the last few remaining male specimens of this species .
" but now we have found the female , there is hope that the species may recover .
" it still seems that these critically endangered creatures are on the very brink of extinction - and although we have been intensively searching the streams all through the night , it appears that the density of the population is precarious . "
the researchers swabbed the frogs before they were released to see if they are carrying the chytrid fungus - a disease thought to have killed of many other species in this area .
they also used a spectrometer to look at the properties of the frogs ' skin to try to find out why this species has survived where others have not .
" it is imperative for the future conservation of costa rican amphibians that collaborative efforts harness the skills of biologists , researchers , educators and committed individuals , if we are to save these rare species , " mr gray added .

they sold their houses in south wales to a company called home assured limited but were left homeless .
the families wanted to continue living in the properties as tenants but the houses were repossessed .
trading standards officers in reading , where home assured is based , said they were investigating .
home assured was not available for comment .
mike talbot and his wife decided to sell their five-bedroomed house and rent it back after seeing an advert for home assured limited in a newspaper .
the couple , who wanted to downsize , sold their home and signed a tenancy agreement to rent it back for a year while they looked for a new house .
but after six months , mr talbot received a letter telling him the property had been repossessed . "
we 've gone from owning a four double-bedroomed cottage to being rehoused in a two-bed council flat " a former customer of home assured " it 's devastating .
we had lived in the house since the year 2000 when we initially bought it , " he told bbc radio wales .
" we had looked after it and it was a lovely house , a five-bedroomed semi-detached house .
" we lost a lot of sleep and worry over it . "
mr talbot was paid some money for the house but said he was still owed £ 18,000 and disputed the £ 27,000 worth of fees the company deducted .
sale-and-rent-back schemes work by allowing home owners to sell their property to a company which pays-off the mortgage .
the former owner then continues living in the property as a tenant .
these schemes are designed to help those in financial trouble to stay in their homes , but home owners will often receive less than the market value for their property .
shelter cymru and citizens ' advice bureau said some people entering into these agreements had received between 20 % and 60 % below the actual value .
there are also fees and a percentage of the sale will often be kept by the company until the tenant leaves or decides to buy the house back .
tenants in such schemes have few rights as companies can sell the property during the tenancy agreement , even without telling the tenant .

she said she was owed more than £ 23,000 by home assured and also disputed the £ 27,000 fee .

these schemes are designed to help those in financial trouble to stay in their homes , but home owners will often receive less than the market value for their property .
shelter cymru and citizens ' advice bureau said some people entering into these agreements had received between 20 % and 60 % below the actual value .
there are also fees and a percentage of the sale will often be kept by the company until the tenant leaves or decides to buy the house back .
tenants in such schemes have few rights as companies can sell the property during the tenancy agreement , even without telling the tenant .

more tourists than ever before are visiting the great white continent .
the international association of antarctica tour operators shows that 37,552 tourists visited antarctica between 2006 and 2007 , with the majority arriving by sea .
however , the water around the continent is a dangerous place , as the passengers on board the m / s explorer found out last year when the liner hit an iceberg and sank .
with more people visiting and the concomitant increase in the number of ships , it is becoming increasingly important to find ways of navigating safely and avoiding future collisions .
the antarctic polar view project is using satellites to map the sea ice , to help ships find the best - and safest - route .
anna lacey went to the british antarctic survey in cambridge to find out about a new project that 's using satellite technology to improve navigation in the southern ocean for the bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
pretty dangerous " there are very large lumps of heavy ice in the water , that might look pretty in white with penguins dancing on top of them , but trust me you do n't want to hit them very fast with a ship , " said andrew fleming from the british antarctic survey who is leading the research .
" if you do , you are going to damage your ship and therefore navigating through it is a problem , not only in terms of the safety of the ship but in terms of the speed of the ship and the efficiency of the ship .
" so , you do n't want to spend an excessive amount of time going through an area of very thick ice when you could be taking a quicker and therefore cheaper route , " he added .
the quickest way to travel through the antarctic is via clear water channels .
however , finding these routes is a difficult task .
" the area we 're dealing with is absolutely enormous ; the only way of monitoring that area of ocean effectively is using satellites .
" we use a satellite called envisat , which is a radar satellite that picks up differences in ocean surface roughness and that allows us to see the difference in open water and the sea ice , " said mr fleming .
the radar allows the team to see straight through the clouds down to the surface of the sea .
with detailed images , it 's even possible to see the cracks in sea ice , which can lead to dangerous ice falls .
robb clifton , who works for the australian antarctic division as a voyage leader , is someone who knows how useful these satellite images are in practice .
" wherever possible , we would use helicopters quite a lot and put them up in the air to map the ice and look for where we might find what we call ' leads ' - you know which are large areas of clear water , that the ship might be able to move through , " he said .
" but it was certainly a much more difficult , time-consuming operation , " he added .
making the most of it although the antarctic polar view project is hugely useful , there are some ways in which it could be improved .
" we ca n't yet determine the thickness of the sea ice but one of the science programmes that we were doing last summer was looking at doing some of that work using satellites as well , and that 's going to be quite an exciting development , " said mr clifton .
the maps of the sea are coloured in various shades of grey , with the dark areas being the smooth open water and the light areas identifying the textured areas of sea ice .
however , taking the image is only the first step as it then has to be sent to the ship .
" internet connections in the antarctic and on ships are notoriously poor and that has meant that we have ended up cropping the image , compressing it a lot and losing a lot of the detail in the image as a result , " said mr fleming . "
internet connections in the antarctic and on ships are notoriously poor " andrew fleming " so , we have to find a way of getting imagery that is very large -lsb- and sending it -rsb- down that very narrow bandwidth to the users on the ship , " he added .
one way they 're doing this is by compressing the images into a format known as jpeg2000 .
" jpeg2000 allows us to compress the image a lot more and secondly it allows us to preserve the geographic position of the image , so it knows where the image is and allows us to position it on a map .
" on the other hand , we are using a system that now allows us to deliver that image in bite size chunks .
" what we deliver first of all is just a low-resolution image of the entire area and then the user can choose what he wants detail of , zoom into that area and then our system only delivers the higher resolution information of that particular area , " said mr fleming .
although the system is fairly new , it 's already making an impact for those who sail the seas .
" we now know fairly well the kind of sea ice conditions we are likely to encounter , so it 's a fantastic and very easy-to-use and easy-to-interpret system that we just run off a laptop on the bridge of the ship , " added mr clifton .

anna lacey went to the british antarctic survey in cambridge to find out about a new project that 's using satellite technology to improve navigation in the southern ocean for the bbc world service 's digital planet programme .
pretty dangerous " there are very large lumps of heavy ice in the water , that might look pretty in white with penguins dancing on top of them , but trust me you do n't want to hit them very fast with a ship , " said andrew fleming from the british antarctic survey who is leading the research .
" if you do , you are going to damage your ship and therefore navigating through it is a problem , not only in terms of the safety of the ship but in terms of the speed of the ship and the efficiency of the ship .
" so , you do n't want to spend an excessive amount of time going through an area of very thick ice when you could be taking a quicker and therefore cheaper route , " he added .
antarctica may look beautiful but it can be a dangerous place the quickest way to travel through the antarctic is via clear water channels .
however , finding these routes is a difficult task .
" the area we 're dealing with is absolutely enormous ; the only way of monitoring that area of ocean effectively is using satellites .
" we use a satellite called envisat , which is a radar satellite that picks up differences in ocean surface roughness and that allows us to see the difference in open water and the sea ice , " said mr fleming .
the radar allows the team to see straight through the clouds down to the surface of the sea .
with detailed images , it 's even possible to see the cracks in sea ice , which can lead to dangerous ice falls .
robb clifton , who works for the australian antarctic division as a voyage leader , is someone who knows how useful these satellite images are in practice .
" wherever possible , we would use helicopters quite a lot and put them up in the air to map the ice and look for where we might find what we call ' leads ' - you know which are large areas of clear water , that the ship might be able to move through , " he said .
" but it was certainly a much more difficult , time-consuming operation , " he added .
making the most of it although the antarctic polar view project is hugely useful , there are some ways in which it could be improved .
" we ca n't yet determine the thickness of the sea ice but one of the science programmes that we were doing last summer was looking at doing some of that work using satellites as well , and that 's going to be quite an exciting development , " said mr clifton .
the maps of the sea are coloured in various shades of grey , with the dark areas being the smooth open water and the light areas identifying the textured areas of sea ice .
however , taking the image is only the first step as it then has to be sent to the ship .
" internet connections in the antarctic and on ships are notoriously poor and that has meant that we have ended up cropping the image , compressing it a lot and losing a lot of the detail in the image as a result , " said mr fleming .
internet connections in the antarctic and on ships are notoriously poor andrew fleming " so , we have to find a way of getting imagery that is very large -lsb- and sending it -rsb- down that very narrow bandwidth to the users on the ship , " he added .
one way they 're doing this is by compressing the images into a format known as jpeg2000 .
" jpeg2000 allows us to compress the image a lot more and secondly it allows us to preserve the geographic position of the image , so it knows where the image is and allows us to position it on a map .
" on the other hand , we are using a system that now allows us to deliver that image in bite size chunks .
" what we deliver first of all is just a low-resolution image of the entire area and then the user can choose what he wants detail of , zoom into that area and then our system only delivers the higher resolution information of that particular area , " said mr fleming .
although the system is fairly new , it 's already making an impact for those who sail the seas .
" we now know fairly well the kind of sea ice conditions we are likely to encounter , so it 's a fantastic and very easy-to-use and easy-to-interpret system that we just run off a laptop on the bridge of the ship , " added mr clifton .
