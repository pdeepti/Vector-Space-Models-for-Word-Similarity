germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.02.2008 germany 's political parties have to rethink options , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is the fifth wheel in germany 's traditionally symmetrical political scene the success of the left party in recent state elections has established parties considering unconventional partners .
political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.02.2008 turkey 's pursuit of kurdish rebels carries european implications großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops have pushed towards pkk camps near the iranian border turkey 's incursion into northern iraq in pursuit of kurdish rebels may have far-reaching consequences .
as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .

as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge .

as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge . " turkey on the verge of autonomous future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , not the army , is thought to have pushed for action merritt also believes that turkey 's bullish attitude and opposition towards a number of nato initiatives are other signs that ankara has grown tired of being batted between the united states and europe .
the kurdistan operation therefore provides a glimpse of a possible future where turkey calls its own shots . " the eu and us have shot themselves in the foot , " merritt said .

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.02.2008 turkey 's pursuit of kurdish rebels carries european implications großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops have pushed towards pkk camps near the iranian border turkey 's incursion into northern iraq in pursuit of kurdish rebels may have far-reaching consequences .
as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge . " turkey on the verge of autonomous future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , not the army , is thought to have pushed for action merritt also believes that turkey 's bullish attitude and opposition towards a number of nato initiatives are other signs that ankara has grown tired of being batted between the united states and europe .
the kurdistan operation therefore provides a glimpse of a possible future where turkey calls its own shots . " the eu and us have shot themselves in the foot , " merritt said .
" here we have a country , a hugely important strategic nation right in the middle of the world 's biggest trouble spot , and they 've lost influence by stringing the turks along .

deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .
" we hope and expect that this cooperation will reassert itself in the future . " stefan dege -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.02.2008 germany 's political parties have to rethink options , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is the fifth wheel in germany 's traditionally symmetrical political scene the success of the left party in recent state elections has established parties considering unconventional partners .
political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge . " turkey on the verge of autonomous future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , not the army , is thought to have pushed for action merritt also believes that turkey 's bullish attitude and opposition towards a number of nato initiatives are other signs that ankara has grown tired of being batted between the united states and europe .
the kurdistan operation therefore provides a glimpse of a possible future where turkey calls its own shots . " the eu and us have shot themselves in the foot , " merritt said .
" here we have a country , a hugely important strategic nation right in the middle of the world 's biggest trouble spot , and they 've lost influence by stringing the turks along .
this is a foretaste of a future in which turkey feels empowered enough to be an autonomous player in international affairs . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge . " turkey on the verge of autonomous future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , not the army , is thought to have pushed for action merritt also believes that turkey 's bullish attitude and opposition towards a number of nato initiatives are other signs that ankara has grown tired of being batted between the united states and europe .
the kurdistan operation therefore provides a glimpse of a possible future where turkey calls its own shots . " the eu and us have shot themselves in the foot , " merritt said .
" here we have a country , a hugely important strategic nation right in the middle of the world 's biggest trouble spot , and they 've lost influence by stringing the turks along .
this is a foretaste of a future in which turkey feels empowered enough to be an autonomous player in international affairs . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accord came just in time for a pair of bridges . two aging railway bridges across the oder-neisse line , the valley dividing germany and poland , are to be replaced under an agreement signed on tuesday , feb .
26 . the agreement shares the costs of maintaining all 13 railway bridges across the oder river and its tributary , the neisse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 26.02.2008 russian election goes unobserved großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kremlin believed the osce had set an " ultimatum " in the run-up to the russian presidential poll on march 2 , the organization for cooperation and security in europe announced earlier this month that it would not send observers .
deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.02.2008 germany 's political parties have to rethink options , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is the fifth wheel in germany 's traditionally symmetrical political scene the success of the left party in recent state elections has established parties considering unconventional partners .
political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .

deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .

26 . the agreement shares the costs of maintaining all 13 railway bridges across the oder river and its tributary , the neisse .

until tuesday , each nation was responsible for the upkeep of half of every bridge . " with this treaty the construction and maintenance needs of the rail bridges between both countries will be regulated for the first time , " tiefensee said of the agreement that took four years to negotiate . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accord came just in time for a pair of bridges . two aging railway bridges across the oder-neisse line , the valley dividing germany and poland , are to be replaced under an agreement signed on tuesday , feb .
26 . the agreement shares the costs of maintaining all 13 railway bridges across the oder river and its tributary , the neisse .
currently two bridges are so old that trains can only cross them slowly . transport ministers wolfgang tiefensee of germany and cezary grabarczyk of poland signed the agreement in the border city of frankfurt an der oder and then ceremonially began work on one of the bridges in the city . one bridge , one country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabarczyk , r . , and tiefensee kicked off work on one of the bridges to be completed by december , the new bridge over the oder will be entirely paid for by germany for a total of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 37.3 million -rrb- and is needed to speed up trains using the main line from moscow to paris via warsaw and berlin . poland will replace a bridge to horka , germany across the neisse river .
that link on the wroclaw-leipzig line is to be restored by 2011 .
grabarczyk could not say how much the project will cost poland . rather than splitting maintenance costs for the 13 international bridges , berlin and warsaw agreed each bridge would be the responsibility of one country .
until tuesday , each nation was responsible for the upkeep of half of every bridge . " with this treaty the construction and maintenance needs of the rail bridges between both countries will be regulated for the first time , " tiefensee said of the agreement that took four years to negotiate . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.02.2008 turkey 's pursuit of kurdish rebels carries european implications großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops have pushed towards pkk camps near the iranian border turkey 's incursion into northern iraq in pursuit of kurdish rebels may have far-reaching consequences .
as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 26.02.2008 russian election goes unobserved großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kremlin believed the osce had set an " ultimatum " in the run-up to the russian presidential poll on march 2 , the organization for cooperation and security in europe announced earlier this month that it would not send observers .
deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .

" the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .
" we hope and expect that this cooperation will reassert itself in the future . " stefan dege -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grabarczyk could not say how much the project will cost poland . rather than splitting maintenance costs for the 13 international bridges , berlin and warsaw agreed each bridge would be the responsibility of one country .
until tuesday , each nation was responsible for the upkeep of half of every bridge . " with this treaty the construction and maintenance needs of the rail bridges between both countries will be regulated for the first time , " tiefensee said of the agreement that took four years to negotiate . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge . " turkey on the verge of autonomous future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , not the army , is thought to have pushed for action merritt also believes that turkey 's bullish attitude and opposition towards a number of nato initiatives are other signs that ankara has grown tired of being batted between the united states and europe .
the kurdistan operation therefore provides a glimpse of a possible future where turkey calls its own shots . " the eu and us have shot themselves in the foot , " merritt said .
" here we have a country , a hugely important strategic nation right in the middle of the world 's biggest trouble spot , and they 've lost influence by stringing the turks along .

while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge . " turkey on the verge of autonomous future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , not the army , is thought to have pushed for action merritt also believes that turkey 's bullish attitude and opposition towards a number of nato initiatives are other signs that ankara has grown tired of being batted between the united states and europe .
the kurdistan operation therefore provides a glimpse of a possible future where turkey calls its own shots . " the eu and us have shot themselves in the foot , " merritt said .
" here we have a country , a hugely important strategic nation right in the middle of the world 's biggest trouble spot , and they 've lost influence by stringing the turks along .
this is a foretaste of a future in which turkey feels empowered enough to be an autonomous player in international affairs . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .

" we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein .

" it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities .

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .

deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .

deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.02.2008 germany 's political parties have to rethink options , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is the fifth wheel in germany 's traditionally symmetrical political scene the success of the left party in recent state elections has established parties considering unconventional partners .
political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .
" we hope and expect that this cooperation will reassert itself in the future . " stefan dege -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .
14 , when prominent german businessman klaus zumwinkel was shown on national television being led from his house by prosecutors .
zumwinkel resigned as head of deutsche post the next day . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently two bridges are so old that trains can only cross them slowly . transport ministers wolfgang tiefensee of germany and cezary grabarczyk of poland signed the agreement in the border city of frankfurt an der oder and then ceremonially began work on one of the bridges in the city . one bridge , one country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabarczyk , r . , and tiefensee kicked off work on one of the bridges to be completed by december , the new bridge over the oder will be entirely paid for by germany for a total of 25 million euros -lrb- $ 37.3 million -rrb- and is needed to speed up trains using the main line from moscow to paris via warsaw and berlin . poland will replace a bridge to horka , germany across the neisse river .
that link on the wroclaw-leipzig line is to be restored by 2011 .
grabarczyk could not say how much the project will cost poland . rather than splitting maintenance costs for the 13 international bridges , berlin and warsaw agreed each bridge would be the responsibility of one country .
until tuesday , each nation was responsible for the upkeep of half of every bridge . " with this treaty the construction and maintenance needs of the rail bridges between both countries will be regulated for the first time , " tiefensee said of the agreement that took four years to negotiate . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 26.02.2008 russian election goes unobserved großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kremlin believed the osce had set an " ultimatum " in the run-up to the russian presidential poll on march 2 , the organization for cooperation and security in europe announced earlier this month that it would not send observers .
deutsche welle takes a closer look . the organization for cooperation and security in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- said on feb .
7 that it would not send a delegation due to restrictions russia planned to impose on its operation .
the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .
" we hope and expect that this cooperation will reassert itself in the future . " stefan dege -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the office for democratic institutions and human rights -lrb- odihr -rrb- had wanted to send observers a full month in advance , which russia opposed . russia , for its part , was annoyed by the osce 's decision , with foreign minister sergey lavrov saying the organization had " refused to come to a sensible compromise " on the conditions surrounding the observer delegation . he also said that odihr had imposed an ultimatum which any " self-respecting country -lsb- would -rsb- not accept . " " disappointing results " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister sergey lavrov jens-hagen eschenbaecher , odihr 's spokesman , said the results of negotiations between russia and his organization were disappointing . " the most central issue for us was being able to guarantee that elections in russia could be observed credibly , " he said . the restrictions which russian authorities wanted to impose concerning the length of the observation period , as well as the number in the delegation , would not have made that possible . " eschenbaecher said the osce felt forced to keep its delegation at home . a poll , after all , does not just consist of what happens on election day , but in the run-up to it .
russia originally wanted to allow the odihr team into the country only three days before the election .
responding to protests , the government then relented and said the team would be permitted entry two weeks prior to the election on march 2 . odihr task is comprehensive an odihr election observation commission normally consists of a core team of trained media analysts , as well as experts in the areas of election legislation and constitutional law , who are stationed in the capital of the electing country . the team is supplemented by long and short-term observers in regions throughout the country , who are supposed to be present six to eight weeks before a poll .
their job is to speak with politicians , candidates , the media and civilian representatives in the various districts about the political atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president putin is on his way out of office , but likely not out of power the kremlin , however , said western countries were trying to make a political impact in russia via election observation missions , such as in the revolutions in the ukraine and georgia - a view odihr spokesman eschenbacher refuted . " russia , like any other osce member country , obliged itself to apply particular standards , and that includes standards for democratic elections , " he said .
" our job is to see whether these standards are being upheld . " still , even though election observers will not be present at sunday 's election , just as they were not for parliamentary polls in december , eschenbaecher said he is optimistic for the future . " we have been able to send observation teams in the past , and there have been no problems with russian authorities , " he said .
" we hope and expect that this cooperation will reassert itself in the future . " stefan dege -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.02.2008 turkey 's pursuit of kurdish rebels carries european implications großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops have pushed towards pkk camps near the iranian border turkey 's incursion into northern iraq in pursuit of kurdish rebels may have far-reaching consequences .
as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .
" this is n't a mission driven by the military ; this is -lsb- prime minister recep tayyip -rsb- erdogan showing who 's in charge . " turkey on the verge of autonomous future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan , not the army , is thought to have pushed for action merritt also believes that turkey 's bullish attitude and opposition towards a number of nato initiatives are other signs that ankara has grown tired of being batted between the united states and europe .
the kurdistan operation therefore provides a glimpse of a possible future where turkey calls its own shots . " the eu and us have shot themselves in the foot , " merritt said .
" here we have a country , a hugely important strategic nation right in the middle of the world 's biggest trouble spot , and they 've lost influence by stringing the turks along .
this is a foretaste of a future in which turkey feels empowered enough to be an autonomous player in international affairs . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.02.2008 germany 's political parties have to rethink options , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is the fifth wheel in germany 's traditionally symmetrical political scene the success of the left party in recent state elections has established parties considering unconventional partners .
political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .

political expert gero neugebauer said he expects germany to have a five-party system by next year . dw-world.de : the political landscape in germany has been drastically shaken up in the recent state elections in hamburg , hesse and lower saxony .
the left party is clearly becoming a rising force .
what do you attribute its success to ? gero neugebauer : there are several reasons for the left party 's success .
one is the general social mood in germany .
people are unsettled .
they think things are n't being approached fairly .
too few have a part in the economic upswing .
and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .

and many think - also in connection with the -lsb- ongoing tax evasion scandal -rsb- - that the gap between rich and poor is continually getting wider and society is becoming more and more divided . the second reason is the protest mind-set that still exists toward the labor and socio-political reforms of the -lsb- previous social democratic-green party -rsb- government coalition .
due to the reforms , people are finding themselves in a financial situation they consider incompatible with a good standard of living - a good standard of living does n't mean luxury but meeting people 's needs . the left party is not only critical of society but also promises more money for social welfare , which brings in more votes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will have to establish itself in next year 's elections , said neugebauer are german voters generally shifting to the left ? the general shift has always been there .
the left party says that globalization leads to a different version of capitalism , that the result is exploitation and a greater social burden .
the germans are n't prepared for that , and they 're always interested in calling for protection .
because they want to have certainty about their future , they say that the simple solutions we had during the 1970s and ' 80s must be a possibility again . why are n't any of the established parties willing to partner with the left party , despite their success in recent elections ?
what are they afraid of ? the established parties are n't adequately prepared for the situation .
they are finding that their coalition options have changed .
until now , they had always assumed that one of the large parties would win enough votes so that they only had to get one , smaller party on board in order to form a majority government .
this is no longer the case . in my opinion , the left party has to survive the next big elections , in 2009 , in order to establish itself - mainly federal but also state elections . then we can expect to have a five-party system .
the parties will have to take a look at the options again .
the social democrats , for example , see that it 's not possible to win back the voters they 've lost since 2000 .
some have gone to the left party ; others just stay at home .
but it 's rational for them to say : okay , if we ca n't get these voters back , we 'll try to cooperate with the party they 've gone to . in hesse , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- under andrea ypsilanti are finally considering creating a minority coalition with toleration from the left party .
will the left party agree to that ? there 's a difference between voting for an spd state premier and supporting her in the work of the government .
there was an example in saxony-anhalt where a similar situation worked for eight years due to regular agreements between the parliamentary groups . the situation in hesse is different .
there , the left party is n't so closed politically , and it 's likely that they will immediately approve some laws and proposals in the state parliament .
i expect that the left party 's political profiling will lead to crises and conflicts that restrict their ability to act . we ca n't assume that support from the left party will be stable ; i think the spd is smart enough not to have to rely on stable support . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg premier von beust is a flexible politician , said neugebauer in hamburg , the conservative cdu is now considering teaming up with the greens after losing their overall majority .
can a cdu-green coalition be successful there ? yes , why not ?
the greens have to try not to suffocate in the cdu 's embrace .
at the state level , the premier is the strong figure .
ole von beust is a very flexible politician .
he 's had a coalition with a right-wing populist party before and now he 's looking to the left . the greens have to insist on getting the political areas that are substantive for them , where they can push through their own ideas .
those will have to be things that fit with their core competence - like environment .
but they need a second area and it will be something more to do with social welfare . they have to have clear boundaries with the cdu , otherwise they 'll go under . what 's the relationship between state-level politics and national politics ? there is an institutional relationship between the two .
the state elections determine the make-up of the parliamentary bodies , which form the government .
the government then sends representatives to the bundesrat , our second chamber . the second influence they have is on the make-up of the federal assembly , which elects the president .
if a party loses mandates in a state election , its faction in the federal assembly is weakened . in general , about three-quarters of voters in state elections are concerned with state issues .
that means there are different reasons to vote one way or another in state and federal elections . however , there are some developments in state politics that anticipate developments at the federal level - like coalition building .
in this context , one could say that if a left-wing parliamentary group supports a state government run by the spd , it could also be a sign for national politics . gero neugebauer is an expert on political parties and systems at the otto suhr institute for political science at the freie universität in berlin . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans have already begun to confess . rich germans have stashed away more than 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- in trusts used to evade taxes , investigators said tuesday , feb .
26 , while presenting an interim report into a probe linked to a liechtenstein bank . prosecutors in the western city of bochum , who are leading the probe , said employees at three domestic german banks were also under investigation . " taxes have been evaded to an immense extent , " spokesman hans-ulrich krueck told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators ' work is increasing by the day , krueck said he said 72 people had come forward to make revised tax assessments and that the domestic revenue service had taken in an additional 27.8 million euros in unpaid taxes .
german law allows tax evaders to " report themselves " and make revised assessments in return for milder penalties . the amount of previously undeclared taxes was rising by the day , krueck said . search warrants had been issued in 120 cases , and the net had thus far drawn in around 150 suspects , of whom 91 had made admissions of guilt , he added . second bank implicated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us tax authorities are looking at 100 americans in relation to the tax scandal apart from the lgt bank in liechtenstein , another foreign bank was involved , the spokesman said .
he refused to provide further information for fear of jeopardizing the investigation . the german finance ministry said it would make the information , which it bought for 4.2 million euros from a bnd foreign intelligence service informant , available to other countries free of charge . " we are going to respond to requests in this regard , " said thorsten albig , spokesman for the finance ministry . global investigations the german investigation has sparked similar inquires in several european countries , the united states and australia . us officials said tuesday they were investigating over 100 american citizens for tax fraud via liechtenstein . " combating off-shore tax avoidance and evasion are high priorities for the irs , " the internal revenue service 's acting commissioner linda stiff said in a statement on tuesday , according to afp news service . " it should be clear from recent events that there is no safe hiding place for the proceeds of tax avoidance and evasion , " stiff said . the australian tax authorities also said tuesday they had opened probes into 20 taxpayers .
french budget minister eric woerth said on tuesday that his country had received a list of " several hundred " people suspected of evading taxes . how to handle hot information concerned over the " moral problem " of buying confidential tax information , danish tax officials have also said they would check for danes on the tax evasion list only if the data landed in their laps . " i do n't like this advanced form of handling stolen goods , and i do n't think this ethic is the best way to ensure that taxes are paid correctly , " danish taxation minister kristian jensen told danish business daily boersen .
" if germany sent us , of its own volition , a list of names of danes with accounts in tax havens , we would be stupid not to check . " the spokesman said prosecutors were working on the assumption that their use of the information was in accordance with german law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if they should be using stolen data as ground for tax investigations authorities in liechtenstein have expressed outrage at the use of stolen information bought from a man who has a conviction in the alpine principality .
a report appearing in thursday 's edition of the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung , however , said the man fingered by liechtenstein is not the german intelligence agency 's informant . lgt said it believed about 1,400 customers , including about 600 germans , were included in the data bought by german authorities . " apparently , the stolen data material has also been illegally disclosed , directly or indirectly , to other authorities , " the bank said in a statement .
" lgt regards such methods as being extremely offensive . " merkel to meet prince of monaco prince albert ii of monaco meanwhile arrived in berlin on tuesday for a two-day visit to consult with chancellor angela merkel and other government officials over the tax scandal .
in addition to liechtenstein and andorra , monaco is among the three nations blacklisted as a tax haven by the organization for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- . banking officials in switzerland and luxembourg , two other countries thought to help foreigners hide money from tax authorities with the help of banking secrecy rules , have both denied any involvement in the international string of investigations . the tax evasion scandal broke on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.02.2008 turkey 's pursuit of kurdish rebels carries european implications großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish troops have pushed towards pkk camps near the iranian border turkey 's incursion into northern iraq in pursuit of kurdish rebels may have far-reaching consequences .
as well as destabilizing iraq 's one peaceful region , the offensive could impact the middle east and europe . it is a conflict which has waxed and waned for over 24 years , but experts say the latest round of hostilities between turkey and armed rebels of the kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- carries more significance than many of those which have erupted before . while the new campaign is not the first time turkish forces have taken the fight into the pkk 's adopted haven of northern iraq , it is the first major incursion since the 2003 us-led invasion toppled former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the last major turkish incursion into northern iraq was in 1997 , when about 50,000 troops were sent to the region to crush the pkk , which ankara accuses of killing nearly 40,000 people since the group began its armed struggle for self-rule in 1984 .
however , while the latest campaign is significantly smaller than the last , the wider implications this time around are greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pursuit of pkk rebels by turkey has angered kurds in a land ravaged by violence , the autonomous region of iraqi kurdistan has been viewed as the most stable in iraq , a recognized political , ethnic and economic area and a glimmer of hope in a devastated and divided country .
it is from here that an estimated 3,000 pkk rebels have launched attacks across the border in turkey . there are major concerns that the turkish incursion will destabilize iraq 's only peaceful region and act as an unwanted injection of fuel into an already intensely flammable area of the world . iraq fears that a prolonged turkish incursion into the northern region could trigger clashes between turkish troops and iraqi kurdish security forces .
while iraqi kurds have little sympathy for the aims of the pkk , there is widespread anger over the incursion and the iraqi kurd leadership has already warned that any targeting of civilians would result in " massive resistance " by its forces . a destabilized iraqi kurdistan is a concern not just for the ethnic kurds living there , the government in baghdad and the united states forces in iraq but also for iran and europe . shaky relations with iran at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has strengthened its forces at the iraqi border iran , which reinforced its border security on sunday , feb .
24 , after fighting between turkish forces and the pkk spread to the nearby qandil mountains , has had its own problems with kurdish rebels .
the party of free life of kurdistan -lrb- pjak -rrb- , an offshoot of the pkk , has mounted raids into iran from its bases in northeastern iraq . while iran has maintained that its increased security is designed to stop kurdish rebels hiding in iran and also to prevent a refugee influx , the build-up of iranian troops on iraq 's borders is certainly contributing to the tense atmosphere , with the us watching developments on the eastern borders very closely . " this incursion is extremely ill-timed in the context of the west 's relations with iran , " said giles merritt , director of the brussels-based think-tank security & defense agenda .
" the eu and united states have just started to hold positive discussions about iran and are slowly admitting their actions have been more than a little ham-fisted .
any involvement in kurdistan runs the risk of destabilizing the region and damaging the fragile relationship with tehran . " the turkish incursion is also being watched with concern in europe , especially after the pkk urged kurdish groups to unleash urban violence across the continent , saying that if turkey turns iraqi kurdistan into " a fire zone " then kurds must do the same in cities across the eu . eu faces repercussions of stalling on membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's attitude to turkey may have driven ankara to act despite the fact that the european union , along with the united states , considers the pkk to be a terrorist group , a campaign of kurdish terrorism across europe in response to the incursion is very unlikely .
however , the eu faces a very different problem arising from turkey 's strong-arm tactics . " up until recently the eu was actively engaged in membership discussions with ankara , and turkey showed restraint , " merritt said .
" what we are seeing with this incursion is evidence of a loss of leverage . " the eu has snubbed turkey with its stalling on accession , and what we see now is ankara showing its displeasure and flexing its muscles , " he added .

after almost nine years in power , russian president vladimir putin will be stepping down .
journalists , academics and statesmen - and our readers - are pondering his legacy . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i do believe that vladimir putin is a savior to russia .
i think he should be the next president of the us .
i really enjoyed seeing him take charge and turn russia around in all ways .
maybe the us can learn from him because everything here is so backward and media controlled .
just my point of view , but i think very highly of russia and vladimir putin . - mark kicklighter , usa when the two countries are compared , russia and the us , over the last eight years of " single person " rule , the state of the respective economies , their status in the international communities and finally the state of democracy in each , i think that putin comes out the clear winner . - virginia mcgowan , us i think putin has convinced many in the world that there is hope for the future of international relations and that the brute power of the us could potentially be contained .
putin has managed to make the world appear more just and fair .
that is his greatest contribution to the world .
by the way , it is a shame that the eu has been impotent as a counterweight to the us .
to his country , putin has been everything .
he was handed a mess and he created a near marvel out of it - no wonder he is so popular .
regarding the upcoming elections , i do n't think most informed people in the world care much .
with economic development and stability will come greater democracy .
if outsiders try to force things , it will become a disaster - like during yeltsin 's time .
so let russia change from within .
it is too great a nation to be pressured from outside . - chatura ranaweera , canada vladimir putin 's time in office brought some prosperity to the economy of his country , although his kgb mentality did not help him to bring democracy to russia . - andres fernandez , mexico mr. putin is the president of russia and should be afforded the respect that he deserves .
he has navigated russia superbly through very turbulent and dangerous times .
he has the energy , will and charisma to do well for russia and its neighbors .
the west would do well to support him as opposed to hurling obstacles or otherwise interfering in the course of what russia can be , rather than push it back to what it was . - nikolaus d. lentner , us to me , vladimir putin is kgb .
he restored " law & order " in russia as yury andropov , the butcher of budapest who was vladimir putin 's mentor and role model , would have wanted it .
with the oil and gas money , the old , aggressive russia is coming back .
watch out ! - paul heinila , canada it is very clear that many people are upset because russia is reorganizing itself and returning step by step , to be a world power again .
all the media is driven by greedy and low " western " interests . - alfredo vera nunez , columbia compiled by dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the guests were served a feast of rice , lentils , vegetables , fish and sweets .
monkeys are revered idols in hindu mythology .
but the couples that took in and " married " off the two monkeys in orissa say they love them as pets .

" it was a unique experience for me .
it was the first time i conducted a marriage between two animals .
but i followed all the rituals that i do in human marriages , " said daitari dash , the priest .
women prepared the female monkey , named jhumuri , as they would a human bride , draping her in a red sari and smearing her with sandalwood paste .
the monkeys were showered with gifts from the villagers the monkeys were showered with gifts by those present .
they included a gold necklace for the bride , donated by a local businessman .
" i feel as if my own daughter is getting married .
i can not bear the thought that she would not be with us anymore , " mamina , the woman who has been looking after the female monkey said .
mamina has been looking after jhumuri since her husband found her at a local temple .
the male monkey , manu , was found in a mango orchard in a neighbouring village by a couple who raised it as their pet .
the two monkeys , who were kept in chains before the marriage , have now been released by their owners .
they have been spotted hanging out at the temple where the " marriage " took place .

experts fear that by failing to recognise their increasing girth some people may be missing a key warning sign of developing type 2 diabetes .
the university of leicester study found men under-estimated their waist size by an average of 3.1 inches -lrb- 7.9cm -rrb- , women by an average of 2.2 inches -lrb- 5.5cm -rrb- .
up to 750,000 people in the uk have type 2 diabetes but do not know it .
at risk of diabetes diabetes uk advises that the following waist measurements put people at risk : women : 31.5 inches -lrb- 80 cm -rrb- white men and black men : 37 inches -lrb- 94cm -rrb- south asian men : 35 inches -lrb- 90cm -rrb- type 2 diabetes can led to devastating complications such as blindness , heart disease , stroke , amputation and kidney disease .
eight out of ten people diagnosed with the condition are overweight at the time of diagnosis .
the researchers asked 502 people to estimate their waist size .
race difference people from white european backgrounds were worse than people from south asian backgrounds when estimating measurements - an average 2.9inches -lrb- 7.4cm -rrb- out , compared to 1.6 inches -lrb- 4.1cm -rrb- for south asians .
measuring your waist measurement needs to be taken at the mid-point between the top of the hip bone and the lowest rib .
ensure the tape is snug , but does not compress the skin and is parallel to the floor .
the measurement should be taken when the person being measured has breathed out .
lead researcher professor kamlesh khunti said people with type 2 diabetes could remain undiagnosed for up to 12 years .
he said the government had recently announced its intention to set up a screening programme to spot early signs of heart problems , kidney disease and diabetes , but self-assessment still had a key role to play .
he said : " this research shows that people need to be educated about the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and about accurately assessing their waist circumference . "
douglas smallwood , of the charity diabetes uk , said : " to believe that you are more than three inches slimmer than you are is to ignore a clear warning of a risk of diabetes .
" it can take years for symptoms of diabetes to emerge so simple indicators like waist size are important signals . "

race difference people from white european backgrounds were worse than people from south asian backgrounds when estimating measurements - an average 2.9inches -lrb- 7.4cm -rrb- out , compared to 1.6 inches -lrb- 4.1cm -rrb- for south asians .
measuring your waist measurement needs to be taken at the mid-point between the top of the hip bone and the lowest rib .

lead researcher professor kamlesh khunti said people with type 2 diabetes could remain undiagnosed for up to 12 years .
he said the government had recently announced its intention to set up a screening programme to spot early signs of heart problems , kidney disease and diabetes , but self-assessment still had a key role to play .
he said : " this research shows that people need to be educated about the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and about accurately assessing their waist circumference . "
douglas smallwood , of the charity diabetes uk , said : " to believe that you are more than three inches slimmer than you are is to ignore a clear warning of a risk of diabetes .
" it can take years for symptoms of diabetes to emerge so simple indicators like waist size are important signals . "

refugees from darfur speak of the horrors of the conflict peace talks have failed to get off the ground , the united nations-african union peacekeeping mission will not be fully deployed for months to come , and two-thirds of the region 's population is dependent on the world 's largest aid operation .
" the situation is not better than it was five years ago , " says auriol miller , head of oxfam in sudan .
" we would still say the situation is getting worse .
humanitarian workers are being targeted and attacked in a way that has got increasingly worse over the last few years . "
when i last visited the remote , arid region in november , destitute refugees lined up at the abu shouk camp , desperate to tell their stories so the world could find out what had happened to them .
map of displaced people from darfur they spoke of toddlers being burnt alive in villages as men on horseback razed their houses to the ground ; of women being raped as they fled their homes looking for safety in the early stages of the conflict .
at night , people said they still found it hard to sleep - terrified of being killed while in their beds .
we can not solve the problem in darfur without chad sudan foreign minister deng alor there has been an upsurge of violence in the last few weeks in west darfur as government forces carried out aerial bombings in an attempt to clear the area of rebel fighters .
despite efforts by the international community , darfur 's war has not been easy to resolve .
the conflict is now far more complex than it was when rebels attacked a garrison town in north darfur state on 26 february 2003 - a date many experts pinpoint as the start of the conflict .
at that time there were only two rebel groups , but the number has multiplied as the factions have fallen out .
sudan 's foreign minister deng alor says the number of rebel groups has made it much harder to solve the conflict .
chad key efforts are underway to unify the different groups so peace talks can restart , but some of the key rebel leaders are still refusing to sign up to the negotiations .
many analysts say that the conflict across the border in chad is also intertwined with the fate of darfur .
last month chad 's government accused sudan of masterminding an attempt to overthrow the country 's president idriss deby using rebels it said were based in darfur .
in return , sudan accuses chad of arming the darfur rebel justice and equality movement -lrb- jem -rrb- , whose leadership is from the same zaghawa group as president deby .
in his blog on darfur , sudan analyst alex de waal writes : " the three armed groups involved in the latest attack -lsb- in the chadian capital n 'djamena -rsb- were all extensively armed by sudanese security , which has the clear intent of cutting off the support that deby is giving to darfur rebels , especially -lsb- jem -rsb- , which has recently been on the offensive in darfur . "
the sudanese have always denied any connection to the chadian rebels .
mr alor said sudan was trying to improve relations with the chadian government .
" the developments in chad have also impacted very negatively on darfur and that makes us as a government want to look for a quick solution for darfur , " said mr alor .
" we are trying to talk to the government of chad because we can not solve the problem in darfur without chad , without improving relations with the government of chad . "
weak force these latest clashes on the remote chad-sudan border have made life difficult for the new un-au peacekeeping mission , which took over from the au on 31 december .
we do n't see an immediate end to this unless unamid is properly resourced auriol miller oxfam in sudan the force , which is supposed to be 26,000-strong , only has around 9,000 peacekeepers and soldiers on the ground .
they are desperately short of personnel as well as essential equipment like helicopters which would make access to remote parts of the region far easier .
despite the difficulties they are facing , unamid has made a positive start in the region .
the peacekeepers have now resumed night patrols and are working hard to ensure that darfuris have confidence in the mission .
oxfam 's ms miller said that it was essential that the international community gave the force , unamid , the support it needed .
" we do n't see an immediate end to this unless unamid is properly resourced and the international community supports ongoing peace negotiations so that they are comprehensive and representative of the community in darfur which is very diverse , " she said .
