highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .
" he clearly was a terrific moral leader , " svejnar said .
" but obviously we are not identical twins . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 05.02.2008 german expellee memorial project continues to rankle poles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions became refugees at the end of world war ii visiting poland on tuesday , germany 's culture minister bernd neumann extolled the merits of an expellee memorial planned for berlin .
the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .

president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .

berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the midst of the tribal violence , europeans face a new reality in their adopted homeland . allan duncan is an independent economic consultant from the uk who works for a number of international organizations in kenya and neighboring sudan .
he and his family have been living in kenya for the past eleven years and have witnessed both the country 's long journey towards stability and its recent dramatic descent into violence and anarchy .
he talked to dw-world.de about life inside the current kenyan chaos . dw-world.de : before the current crisis , most europeans saw kenya as a relatively stable , progressive african nation with a booming tourism industry , and a higher standard of living than other countries on the continent .
was this a fair assessment ? allan duncan : kenya went through a period of transition from the old regime of daniel arap moi , the ex-president who handed over power in previous elections peacefully , to the kabaki government , which has seen significant economic growth and prosperity within the country over the past five years .
while there was still poverty and tensions , things on the whole were going well in the country - new businesses were opening , employment had increased and the middle classes of the country where buying their mercedes ’ and bmws .
all of that changed after the elections of dec .
27 last year . in your opinion , was it purely the presidential election results which sparked the violence ? the riots and deaths that quickly became the daily routine in the west of the country around kusumu , the main stronghold of the opposition presidential candidate , were portrayed as an ethnic fight between the luo -lrb- the opposition -rrb- and the kikuyu -lrb- the government -rrb- .
this , however , overly simplified what was actually going on at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unrest began with voters enraged at the political process kenya has had a history of tribal favoritism in terms of distribution of resources and positions of power since independence .
with the previous elections of 2002 , the country had voted en masse for a change to this distribution and ethos of the prevailing powers in the country .
change did happen , although within quite a short period of time , the establishment quickly reverted to the cronyism and corruption of the previous regimes that they had promised to eradicate . this was combined with a growing stranglehold on the means of production and political decision-making within kenya .
a resurgence of marginalization and poverty once again took root within the non-politically connected tribes fostering resentment and disaffection . what was the immediate atmosphere before and after the election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mwai kibaki is accused of stealing the vote with the lessons that people had learned from the 2002 elections , a growing ground swell of anti-government feeling began in the build-up to the 2007 elections .
when the results of the election started coming in two days after the voting , the perception , whether right or wrong , was that the election had been stolen by the sitting government and the legitimate democratic voice of the country had not only been muffled but totally ignored . without a proper investigation into what happened during the elections and the vote tallying , which did have some serious and well-documented irregularities , it is impossible to know if the election was lost or stolen . so , was the violence that followed the announcement of the election results rooted more in the distrust between ethnic groups rather than opposition supporters against government followers ? the violence that ensued in kisumu and various other western kenyan towns was more a reflection of the anger of people seeing that they were going to be ignored and pushed aside again for another five years more than any ethnic animosity towards kikuyus themselves . what is the situation now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election violence is now fighting between tribes over the period of the past month , the situation has changed and we have been witnessing a growing balkanization taking place , supported either implicitly or explicitly by the various political leaders of both sides .
a growing resentment and violence towards the tribes rather than the political process has taken root with accelerating brutality and frequency of attacks taking place . are we in europe seeing the full picture of what is going on in kenya ? no matter what images you are seeing on the outside about the levels of violence and killings that are going on in kenya at the moment , the reality is actually worse , far worse than it is portrayed .
you don ’ t see the beheadings … you don ’ t hear the stories of people being buried alive .
it ’ s much , much worse . what is life like for you and the other expatriates who are living in nairobi ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in nairobi continues as daily riots rage in its slums despite the brutality of the killings and chaos that is engulfing the country at the moment there is a very strange , almost dreamlike , calm within nairobi with most people still going on about their normal lives .
although the violence and killings outside of nairobi and within the slum areas of the city have been almost continuous since the end of 2007 , only sporadic - although extremely violent - confrontations have spilled out onto the main areas of nairobi over that time . this has lead to the surreal events where friends have been having coffee in the junction , one of nairobi ’ s main shopping malls , and watching running battles outside of the gate between rioters and police with tear gas , clubs and machetes being used .
saying that , driving the children to school and trying to distract their attention away from the bodies lying at the side of the road from the previous days violence was not previously an everyday event . do you and your family , as white europeans , feel under any threat at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign tourists and expatriates are leaving kenya there hasn ’ t , as far as i know , been any violence or intimidation directed towards europeans at the moment , but the situation remains precarious .
talking to a number of friends , they tell me that they have already bought tickets back home , have their bags packed and are ready to leave . but there must be an increased level of danger ? the main danger for us is being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .
although we may not be specifically targeted at the moment , if you drive into a riot there may not be a whole lot of differentiation that either the rioters or the police may give .
one of the major issues for us in nairobi is the fact there are relatively few roads in and out of the city .
if anything happens on these roads then you can become effectively trapped in one area unable to move until the situation changes . my sons are still attending school , although rather sporadically at times , and were trapped at one end of the city during a riot while my wife and i where at the other end of the city , unable to get to them .
although they were fine and the situation resolved itself , the continuing uncertainty and immediacy of the violence here terrifies me .
i fear for the safety of my children on the school trips every morning as they have to cross over what have effectively been the main flash points for the riots over the past month , every morning and evening . how do you see your future in kenya , and the future of kenya itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of a return to normal life dwindles fast we have lived here for over eleven years and have bought land hoping to build a house that would be our home for the rest of our lives .
over the past month , all of that has changed with us wondering if this is even going to be our home next week . a large number of our friends here , mostly from various parts of europe or north america , have built lives and families here in kenya , positively choosing to stay here because of the beauty of the country and the people .
the kenya that we had grown to love , respect and admire is gone .
hopefully the country and its people will pull back from the brink and we can once again see a future and life here in kenya .
but those hopes dim with every new killing and retreat into tribalism . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the results of the election started coming in two days after the voting , the perception , whether right or wrong , was that the election had been stolen by the sitting government and the legitimate democratic voice of the country had not only been muffled but totally ignored . without a proper investigation into what happened during the elections and the vote tallying , which did have some serious and well-documented irregularities , it is impossible to know if the election was lost or stolen . so , was the violence that followed the announcement of the election results rooted more in the distrust between ethnic groups rather than opposition supporters against government followers ? the violence that ensued in kisumu and various other western kenyan towns was more a reflection of the anger of people seeing that they were going to be ignored and pushed aside again for another five years more than any ethnic animosity towards kikuyus themselves . what is the situation now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election violence is now fighting between tribes over the period of the past month , the situation has changed and we have been witnessing a growing balkanization taking place , supported either implicitly or explicitly by the various political leaders of both sides .
a growing resentment and violence towards the tribes rather than the political process has taken root with accelerating brutality and frequency of attacks taking place . are we in europe seeing the full picture of what is going on in kenya ? no matter what images you are seeing on the outside about the levels of violence and killings that are going on in kenya at the moment , the reality is actually worse , far worse than it is portrayed .
you don ’ t see the beheadings … you don ’ t hear the stories of people being buried alive .
it ’ s much , much worse . what is life like for you and the other expatriates who are living in nairobi ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in nairobi continues as daily riots rage in its slums despite the brutality of the killings and chaos that is engulfing the country at the moment there is a very strange , almost dreamlike , calm within nairobi with most people still going on about their normal lives .
although the violence and killings outside of nairobi and within the slum areas of the city have been almost continuous since the end of 2007 , only sporadic - although extremely violent - confrontations have spilled out onto the main areas of nairobi over that time . this has lead to the surreal events where friends have been having coffee in the junction , one of nairobi ’ s main shopping malls , and watching running battles outside of the gate between rioters and police with tear gas , clubs and machetes being used .
saying that , driving the children to school and trying to distract their attention away from the bodies lying at the side of the road from the previous days violence was not previously an everyday event . do you and your family , as white europeans , feel under any threat at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign tourists and expatriates are leaving kenya there hasn ’ t , as far as i know , been any violence or intimidation directed towards europeans at the moment , but the situation remains precarious .
talking to a number of friends , they tell me that they have already bought tickets back home , have their bags packed and are ready to leave . but there must be an increased level of danger ? the main danger for us is being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .
although we may not be specifically targeted at the moment , if you drive into a riot there may not be a whole lot of differentiation that either the rioters or the police may give .
one of the major issues for us in nairobi is the fact there are relatively few roads in and out of the city .
if anything happens on these roads then you can become effectively trapped in one area unable to move until the situation changes . my sons are still attending school , although rather sporadically at times , and were trapped at one end of the city during a riot while my wife and i where at the other end of the city , unable to get to them .
although they were fine and the situation resolved itself , the continuing uncertainty and immediacy of the violence here terrifies me .
i fear for the safety of my children on the school trips every morning as they have to cross over what have effectively been the main flash points for the riots over the past month , every morning and evening . how do you see your future in kenya , and the future of kenya itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of a return to normal life dwindles fast we have lived here for over eleven years and have bought land hoping to build a house that would be our home for the rest of our lives .
over the past month , all of that has changed with us wondering if this is even going to be our home next week . a large number of our friends here , mostly from various parts of europe or north america , have built lives and families here in kenya , positively choosing to stay here because of the beauty of the country and the people .
the kenya that we had grown to love , respect and admire is gone .
hopefully the country and its people will pull back from the brink and we can once again see a future and life here in kenya .
but those hopes dim with every new killing and retreat into tribalism . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .

the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .

he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .

the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .

he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government .

he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.02.2008 czech presidential election highlights resilient grudges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential candidate jan svejnar faces criticism and the old guard in his bid for election despite all the eu trappings which give the czech republic the impression of a fully-integrated member state , the old divisions from the country 's early post-communist days still remain engrained in its political fabric . the czech republic may have been an eu member for four years and is currently still enjoying the flush of joining the bloc 's passport-free schengen zone at the end of 2007 , but old rivalries , like that fostered by bitter arch-foes and former presidents vaclav havel and vaclav klaus , hark back to a darker time .
highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .
" he clearly was a terrific moral leader , " svejnar said .
" but obviously we are not identical twins . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.02.2008 italy faces snap elections as government discussions fail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier prodi and his predecessor berlusconi could be back on the campaign trail soon italy has been searching for a way to create an interim government capable of overseeing the necessary reforms in electoral law since roman prodi resigned in january .
the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.02.2008 czech presidential election highlights resilient grudges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential candidate jan svejnar faces criticism and the old guard in his bid for election despite all the eu trappings which give the czech republic the impression of a fully-integrated member state , the old divisions from the country 's early post-communist days still remain engrained in its political fabric . the czech republic may have been an eu member for four years and is currently still enjoying the flush of joining the bloc 's passport-free schengen zone at the end of 2007 , but old rivalries , like that fostered by bitter arch-foes and former presidents vaclav havel and vaclav klaus , hark back to a darker time .
highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .

the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .

the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .

and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.02.2008 czech presidential election highlights resilient grudges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential candidate jan svejnar faces criticism and the old guard in his bid for election despite all the eu trappings which give the czech republic the impression of a fully-integrated member state , the old divisions from the country 's early post-communist days still remain engrained in its political fabric . the czech republic may have been an eu member for four years and is currently still enjoying the flush of joining the bloc 's passport-free schengen zone at the end of 2007 , but old rivalries , like that fostered by bitter arch-foes and former presidents vaclav havel and vaclav klaus , hark back to a darker time .
highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .
" he clearly was a terrific moral leader , " svejnar said .

aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .

as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .

it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .

highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 05.02.2008 italy faces snap elections as government discussions fail großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier prodi and his predecessor berlusconi could be back on the campaign trail soon italy has been searching for a way to create an interim government capable of overseeing the necessary reforms in electoral law since roman prodi resigned in january .
the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday .

kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future .

5 .
he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.02.2008 czech presidential election highlights resilient grudges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential candidate jan svejnar faces criticism and the old guard in his bid for election despite all the eu trappings which give the czech republic the impression of a fully-integrated member state , the old divisions from the country 's early post-communist days still remain engrained in its political fabric . the czech republic may have been an eu member for four years and is currently still enjoying the flush of joining the bloc 's passport-free schengen zone at the end of 2007 , but old rivalries , like that fostered by bitter arch-foes and former presidents vaclav havel and vaclav klaus , hark back to a darker time .
highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .

highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .

despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 05.02.2008 criticism for german town 's honoring of nazi rocket scientist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 was the nazis ' great hope in the last months of the war despite claims by the town 's mayor that klaus riedel was a pioneer of german rocket science , others have criticized the town for naming its school after a man some claim was a nazi weapons designer . schools tend to be named after people whose legacy , it can be claimed , is one which encourages its pupils to aspire to its patron 's ideals .
the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .
naming a school after someone who had a leading function on this rocket project raises serious moral issues . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .

concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .
naming a school after someone who had a leading function on this rocket project raises serious moral issues . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 05.02.2008 criticism for german town 's honoring of nazi rocket scientist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 was the nazis ' great hope in the last months of the war despite claims by the town 's mayor that klaus riedel was a pioneer of german rocket science , others have criticized the town for naming its school after a man some claim was a nazi weapons designer . schools tend to be named after people whose legacy , it can be claimed , is one which encourages its pupils to aspire to its patron 's ideals .
the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .

the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .

5 .
he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .

president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .
" he clearly was a terrific moral leader , " svejnar said .
" but obviously we are not identical twins . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .

svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .
" he clearly was a terrific moral leader , " svejnar said .

the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .

the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 05.02.2008 german expellee memorial project continues to rankle poles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions became refugees at the end of world war ii visiting poland on tuesday , germany 's culture minister bernd neumann extolled the merits of an expellee memorial planned for berlin .
the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .

highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .

" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .

as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 05.02.2008 german expellee memorial project continues to rankle poles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions became refugees at the end of world war ii visiting poland on tuesday , germany 's culture minister bernd neumann extolled the merits of an expellee memorial planned for berlin .
the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.02.2008 inside kenya 's chaos : a european 's perspective großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while ethnic violence continues , europeans fear any escalation which could involve them the world has been shocked by the rapid downward spiral kenya has taken since the presidential elections in december .
in the midst of the tribal violence , europeans face a new reality in their adopted homeland . allan duncan is an independent economic consultant from the uk who works for a number of international organizations in kenya and neighboring sudan .
he and his family have been living in kenya for the past eleven years and have witnessed both the country 's long journey towards stability and its recent dramatic descent into violence and anarchy .
he talked to dw-world.de about life inside the current kenyan chaos . dw-world.de : before the current crisis , most europeans saw kenya as a relatively stable , progressive african nation with a booming tourism industry , and a higher standard of living than other countries on the continent .
was this a fair assessment ? allan duncan : kenya went through a period of transition from the old regime of daniel arap moi , the ex-president who handed over power in previous elections peacefully , to the kabaki government , which has seen significant economic growth and prosperity within the country over the past five years .
while there was still poverty and tensions , things on the whole were going well in the country - new businesses were opening , employment had increased and the middle classes of the country where buying their mercedes ’ and bmws .
all of that changed after the elections of dec .
27 last year . in your opinion , was it purely the presidential election results which sparked the violence ? the riots and deaths that quickly became the daily routine in the west of the country around kusumu , the main stronghold of the opposition presidential candidate , were portrayed as an ethnic fight between the luo -lrb- the opposition -rrb- and the kikuyu -lrb- the government -rrb- .
this , however , overly simplified what was actually going on at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unrest began with voters enraged at the political process kenya has had a history of tribal favoritism in terms of distribution of resources and positions of power since independence .
with the previous elections of 2002 , the country had voted en masse for a change to this distribution and ethos of the prevailing powers in the country .
change did happen , although within quite a short period of time , the establishment quickly reverted to the cronyism and corruption of the previous regimes that they had promised to eradicate . this was combined with a growing stranglehold on the means of production and political decision-making within kenya .
a resurgence of marginalization and poverty once again took root within the non-politically connected tribes fostering resentment and disaffection . what was the immediate atmosphere before and after the election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mwai kibaki is accused of stealing the vote with the lessons that people had learned from the 2002 elections , a growing ground swell of anti-government feeling began in the build-up to the 2007 elections .
when the results of the election started coming in two days after the voting , the perception , whether right or wrong , was that the election had been stolen by the sitting government and the legitimate democratic voice of the country had not only been muffled but totally ignored . without a proper investigation into what happened during the elections and the vote tallying , which did have some serious and well-documented irregularities , it is impossible to know if the election was lost or stolen . so , was the violence that followed the announcement of the election results rooted more in the distrust between ethnic groups rather than opposition supporters against government followers ? the violence that ensued in kisumu and various other western kenyan towns was more a reflection of the anger of people seeing that they were going to be ignored and pushed aside again for another five years more than any ethnic animosity towards kikuyus themselves . what is the situation now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election violence is now fighting between tribes over the period of the past month , the situation has changed and we have been witnessing a growing balkanization taking place , supported either implicitly or explicitly by the various political leaders of both sides .
a growing resentment and violence towards the tribes rather than the political process has taken root with accelerating brutality and frequency of attacks taking place . are we in europe seeing the full picture of what is going on in kenya ? no matter what images you are seeing on the outside about the levels of violence and killings that are going on in kenya at the moment , the reality is actually worse , far worse than it is portrayed .
you don ’ t see the beheadings … you don ’ t hear the stories of people being buried alive .
it ’ s much , much worse . what is life like for you and the other expatriates who are living in nairobi ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in nairobi continues as daily riots rage in its slums despite the brutality of the killings and chaos that is engulfing the country at the moment there is a very strange , almost dreamlike , calm within nairobi with most people still going on about their normal lives .
although the violence and killings outside of nairobi and within the slum areas of the city have been almost continuous since the end of 2007 , only sporadic - although extremely violent - confrontations have spilled out onto the main areas of nairobi over that time . this has lead to the surreal events where friends have been having coffee in the junction , one of nairobi ’ s main shopping malls , and watching running battles outside of the gate between rioters and police with tear gas , clubs and machetes being used .
saying that , driving the children to school and trying to distract their attention away from the bodies lying at the side of the road from the previous days violence was not previously an everyday event . do you and your family , as white europeans , feel under any threat at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign tourists and expatriates are leaving kenya there hasn ’ t , as far as i know , been any violence or intimidation directed towards europeans at the moment , but the situation remains precarious .
talking to a number of friends , they tell me that they have already bought tickets back home , have their bags packed and are ready to leave . but there must be an increased level of danger ? the main danger for us is being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .
although we may not be specifically targeted at the moment , if you drive into a riot there may not be a whole lot of differentiation that either the rioters or the police may give .
one of the major issues for us in nairobi is the fact there are relatively few roads in and out of the city .
if anything happens on these roads then you can become effectively trapped in one area unable to move until the situation changes . my sons are still attending school , although rather sporadically at times , and were trapped at one end of the city during a riot while my wife and i where at the other end of the city , unable to get to them .
although they were fine and the situation resolved itself , the continuing uncertainty and immediacy of the violence here terrifies me .
i fear for the safety of my children on the school trips every morning as they have to cross over what have effectively been the main flash points for the riots over the past month , every morning and evening . how do you see your future in kenya , and the future of kenya itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of a return to normal life dwindles fast we have lived here for over eleven years and have bought land hoping to build a house that would be our home for the rest of our lives .
over the past month , all of that has changed with us wondering if this is even going to be our home next week . a large number of our friends here , mostly from various parts of europe or north america , have built lives and families here in kenya , positively choosing to stay here because of the beauty of the country and the people .
the kenya that we had grown to love , respect and admire is gone .
hopefully the country and its people will pull back from the brink and we can once again see a future and life here in kenya .
but those hopes dim with every new killing and retreat into tribalism . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 05.02.2008 criticism for german town 's honoring of nazi rocket scientist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 was the nazis ' great hope in the last months of the war despite claims by the town 's mayor that klaus riedel was a pioneer of german rocket science , others have criticized the town for naming its school after a man some claim was a nazi weapons designer . schools tend to be named after people whose legacy , it can be claimed , is one which encourages its pupils to aspire to its patron 's ideals .
the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .

5 .
he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 05.02.2008 criticism for german town 's honoring of nazi rocket scientist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 was the nazis ' great hope in the last months of the war despite claims by the town 's mayor that klaus riedel was a pioneer of german rocket science , others have criticized the town for naming its school after a man some claim was a nazi weapons designer . schools tend to be named after people whose legacy , it can be claimed , is one which encourages its pupils to aspire to its patron 's ideals .
the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .

she was born in australia but lived in england for five years when she was young . " i guess i do n't sound terribly aussie on the air " , she says .
" but there 's a good reason for that .
when i arrived in england in the 1960 's from australia , the kids at school used to tease me all the time because of my aussie accent .
it used to drive me nuts so the accent had to go !
unfortunately , when i got went back to australia in 1975 , i sounded so posh that i got teased again for being a pom !
i just could n't win . "
after doing her bachelor of arts in history and then a postgraduate degree in library science in her homestate of queensland , she finally decided journalism was for her and went back for a degree in journalism .
" i knew i was on the right track when i won a journalism award for the queensland division of the institution of engineers in australia .
you see , i did n't know a thing about engineering , but i knew i could write ! "
helen loves the challenge each week of putting together a one hour sound rich show about europe .
" it 's great fun dealing with the reporting team as well as having the opportunity to interview people who are actually making decisions about europe 's future . "
she 's always been an avid traveller and can never quite decide where to go next on holidays .
since arriving in gemany , eastern europe has held a particular attraction for her . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.02.2008 czech presidential election highlights resilient grudges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential candidate jan svejnar faces criticism and the old guard in his bid for election despite all the eu trappings which give the czech republic the impression of a fully-integrated member state , the old divisions from the country 's early post-communist days still remain engrained in its political fabric . the czech republic may have been an eu member for four years and is currently still enjoying the flush of joining the bloc 's passport-free schengen zone at the end of 2007 , but old rivalries , like that fostered by bitter arch-foes and former presidents vaclav havel and vaclav klaus , hark back to a darker time .
highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .

after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .

communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .

highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .
left in minority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marini returned his mandate to president napolitano -lrb- left -rrb- the stance of the center-right under berlusconi 's influence effectively put paid to marini 's chances of cobbling together a majority in parliament , especially in the upper house senate where , following prodi 's demise , the center-left is in minority .
president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the midst of the tribal violence , europeans face a new reality in their adopted homeland . allan duncan is an independent economic consultant from the uk who works for a number of international organizations in kenya and neighboring sudan .
he and his family have been living in kenya for the past eleven years and have witnessed both the country 's long journey towards stability and its recent dramatic descent into violence and anarchy .
he talked to dw-world.de about life inside the current kenyan chaos . dw-world.de : before the current crisis , most europeans saw kenya as a relatively stable , progressive african nation with a booming tourism industry , and a higher standard of living than other countries on the continent .
was this a fair assessment ? allan duncan : kenya went through a period of transition from the old regime of daniel arap moi , the ex-president who handed over power in previous elections peacefully , to the kabaki government , which has seen significant economic growth and prosperity within the country over the past five years .
while there was still poverty and tensions , things on the whole were going well in the country - new businesses were opening , employment had increased and the middle classes of the country where buying their mercedes ’ and bmws .
all of that changed after the elections of dec .
27 last year . in your opinion , was it purely the presidential election results which sparked the violence ? the riots and deaths that quickly became the daily routine in the west of the country around kusumu , the main stronghold of the opposition presidential candidate , were portrayed as an ethnic fight between the luo -lrb- the opposition -rrb- and the kikuyu -lrb- the government -rrb- .
this , however , overly simplified what was actually going on at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unrest began with voters enraged at the political process kenya has had a history of tribal favoritism in terms of distribution of resources and positions of power since independence .
with the previous elections of 2002 , the country had voted en masse for a change to this distribution and ethos of the prevailing powers in the country .
change did happen , although within quite a short period of time , the establishment quickly reverted to the cronyism and corruption of the previous regimes that they had promised to eradicate . this was combined with a growing stranglehold on the means of production and political decision-making within kenya .
a resurgence of marginalization and poverty once again took root within the non-politically connected tribes fostering resentment and disaffection . what was the immediate atmosphere before and after the election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mwai kibaki is accused of stealing the vote with the lessons that people had learned from the 2002 elections , a growing ground swell of anti-government feeling began in the build-up to the 2007 elections .
when the results of the election started coming in two days after the voting , the perception , whether right or wrong , was that the election had been stolen by the sitting government and the legitimate democratic voice of the country had not only been muffled but totally ignored . without a proper investigation into what happened during the elections and the vote tallying , which did have some serious and well-documented irregularities , it is impossible to know if the election was lost or stolen . so , was the violence that followed the announcement of the election results rooted more in the distrust between ethnic groups rather than opposition supporters against government followers ? the violence that ensued in kisumu and various other western kenyan towns was more a reflection of the anger of people seeing that they were going to be ignored and pushed aside again for another five years more than any ethnic animosity towards kikuyus themselves . what is the situation now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election violence is now fighting between tribes over the period of the past month , the situation has changed and we have been witnessing a growing balkanization taking place , supported either implicitly or explicitly by the various political leaders of both sides .
a growing resentment and violence towards the tribes rather than the political process has taken root with accelerating brutality and frequency of attacks taking place . are we in europe seeing the full picture of what is going on in kenya ? no matter what images you are seeing on the outside about the levels of violence and killings that are going on in kenya at the moment , the reality is actually worse , far worse than it is portrayed .
you don ’ t see the beheadings … you don ’ t hear the stories of people being buried alive .
it ’ s much , much worse . what is life like for you and the other expatriates who are living in nairobi ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in nairobi continues as daily riots rage in its slums despite the brutality of the killings and chaos that is engulfing the country at the moment there is a very strange , almost dreamlike , calm within nairobi with most people still going on about their normal lives .
although the violence and killings outside of nairobi and within the slum areas of the city have been almost continuous since the end of 2007 , only sporadic - although extremely violent - confrontations have spilled out onto the main areas of nairobi over that time . this has lead to the surreal events where friends have been having coffee in the junction , one of nairobi ’ s main shopping malls , and watching running battles outside of the gate between rioters and police with tear gas , clubs and machetes being used .
saying that , driving the children to school and trying to distract their attention away from the bodies lying at the side of the road from the previous days violence was not previously an everyday event . do you and your family , as white europeans , feel under any threat at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign tourists and expatriates are leaving kenya there hasn ’ t , as far as i know , been any violence or intimidation directed towards europeans at the moment , but the situation remains precarious .
talking to a number of friends , they tell me that they have already bought tickets back home , have their bags packed and are ready to leave . but there must be an increased level of danger ? the main danger for us is being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .
although we may not be specifically targeted at the moment , if you drive into a riot there may not be a whole lot of differentiation that either the rioters or the police may give .
one of the major issues for us in nairobi is the fact there are relatively few roads in and out of the city .
if anything happens on these roads then you can become effectively trapped in one area unable to move until the situation changes . my sons are still attending school , although rather sporadically at times , and were trapped at one end of the city during a riot while my wife and i where at the other end of the city , unable to get to them .
although they were fine and the situation resolved itself , the continuing uncertainty and immediacy of the violence here terrifies me .
i fear for the safety of my children on the school trips every morning as they have to cross over what have effectively been the main flash points for the riots over the past month , every morning and evening . how do you see your future in kenya , and the future of kenya itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of a return to normal life dwindles fast we have lived here for over eleven years and have bought land hoping to build a house that would be our home for the rest of our lives .
over the past month , all of that has changed with us wondering if this is even going to be our home next week . a large number of our friends here , mostly from various parts of europe or north america , have built lives and families here in kenya , positively choosing to stay here because of the beauty of the country and the people .
the kenya that we had grown to love , respect and admire is gone .
hopefully the country and its people will pull back from the brink and we can once again see a future and life here in kenya .

in the midst of the tribal violence , europeans face a new reality in their adopted homeland . allan duncan is an independent economic consultant from the uk who works for a number of international organizations in kenya and neighboring sudan .
he and his family have been living in kenya for the past eleven years and have witnessed both the country 's long journey towards stability and its recent dramatic descent into violence and anarchy .
he talked to dw-world.de about life inside the current kenyan chaos . dw-world.de : before the current crisis , most europeans saw kenya as a relatively stable , progressive african nation with a booming tourism industry , and a higher standard of living than other countries on the continent .
was this a fair assessment ? allan duncan : kenya went through a period of transition from the old regime of daniel arap moi , the ex-president who handed over power in previous elections peacefully , to the kabaki government , which has seen significant economic growth and prosperity within the country over the past five years .
while there was still poverty and tensions , things on the whole were going well in the country - new businesses were opening , employment had increased and the middle classes of the country where buying their mercedes ’ and bmws .
all of that changed after the elections of dec .
27 last year . in your opinion , was it purely the presidential election results which sparked the violence ? the riots and deaths that quickly became the daily routine in the west of the country around kusumu , the main stronghold of the opposition presidential candidate , were portrayed as an ethnic fight between the luo -lrb- the opposition -rrb- and the kikuyu -lrb- the government -rrb- .
this , however , overly simplified what was actually going on at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unrest began with voters enraged at the political process kenya has had a history of tribal favoritism in terms of distribution of resources and positions of power since independence .
with the previous elections of 2002 , the country had voted en masse for a change to this distribution and ethos of the prevailing powers in the country .
change did happen , although within quite a short period of time , the establishment quickly reverted to the cronyism and corruption of the previous regimes that they had promised to eradicate . this was combined with a growing stranglehold on the means of production and political decision-making within kenya .
a resurgence of marginalization and poverty once again took root within the non-politically connected tribes fostering resentment and disaffection . what was the immediate atmosphere before and after the election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mwai kibaki is accused of stealing the vote with the lessons that people had learned from the 2002 elections , a growing ground swell of anti-government feeling began in the build-up to the 2007 elections .

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .

efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .

changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.02.2008 czech presidential election highlights resilient grudges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential candidate jan svejnar faces criticism and the old guard in his bid for election despite all the eu trappings which give the czech republic the impression of a fully-integrated member state , the old divisions from the country 's early post-communist days still remain engrained in its political fabric . the czech republic may have been an eu member for four years and is currently still enjoying the flush of joining the bloc 's passport-free schengen zone at the end of 2007 , but old rivalries , like that fostered by bitter arch-foes and former presidents vaclav havel and vaclav klaus , hark back to a darker time .
highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .

" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "

but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday .

kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 05.02.2008 german expellee memorial project continues to rankle poles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions became refugees at the end of world war ii visiting poland on tuesday , germany 's culture minister bernd neumann extolled the merits of an expellee memorial planned for berlin .
the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .

he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government .

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .
nevertheless , a german delegation is going to travel to poland to take a closer look at the proposed polish project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has suggested combining efforts dieter bingen from the german-polish institute said he was skeptical that the polish point of view would be represented in the german project .
it probably makes more sense for the polish to not be involved in the project directly , as it allows them to offer outside criticism .
tusk seems likely to continue his criticism .
tusk told the online edition of the mass-selling newspaper bild that poland would never accept anything that called into question how the war was seen in its historical context .
" it is important that the plans for a center against the expulsions in berlin are abandoned , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .

president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.02.2008 inside kenya 's chaos : a european 's perspective großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while ethnic violence continues , europeans fear any escalation which could involve them the world has been shocked by the rapid downward spiral kenya has taken since the presidential elections in december .
in the midst of the tribal violence , europeans face a new reality in their adopted homeland . allan duncan is an independent economic consultant from the uk who works for a number of international organizations in kenya and neighboring sudan .
he and his family have been living in kenya for the past eleven years and have witnessed both the country 's long journey towards stability and its recent dramatic descent into violence and anarchy .
he talked to dw-world.de about life inside the current kenyan chaos . dw-world.de : before the current crisis , most europeans saw kenya as a relatively stable , progressive african nation with a booming tourism industry , and a higher standard of living than other countries on the continent .
was this a fair assessment ? allan duncan : kenya went through a period of transition from the old regime of daniel arap moi , the ex-president who handed over power in previous elections peacefully , to the kabaki government , which has seen significant economic growth and prosperity within the country over the past five years .
while there was still poverty and tensions , things on the whole were going well in the country - new businesses were opening , employment had increased and the middle classes of the country where buying their mercedes ’ and bmws .
all of that changed after the elections of dec .
27 last year . in your opinion , was it purely the presidential election results which sparked the violence ? the riots and deaths that quickly became the daily routine in the west of the country around kusumu , the main stronghold of the opposition presidential candidate , were portrayed as an ethnic fight between the luo -lrb- the opposition -rrb- and the kikuyu -lrb- the government -rrb- .
this , however , overly simplified what was actually going on at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unrest began with voters enraged at the political process kenya has had a history of tribal favoritism in terms of distribution of resources and positions of power since independence .
with the previous elections of 2002 , the country had voted en masse for a change to this distribution and ethos of the prevailing powers in the country .
change did happen , although within quite a short period of time , the establishment quickly reverted to the cronyism and corruption of the previous regimes that they had promised to eradicate . this was combined with a growing stranglehold on the means of production and political decision-making within kenya .
a resurgence of marginalization and poverty once again took root within the non-politically connected tribes fostering resentment and disaffection . what was the immediate atmosphere before and after the election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mwai kibaki is accused of stealing the vote with the lessons that people had learned from the 2002 elections , a growing ground swell of anti-government feeling began in the build-up to the 2007 elections .
when the results of the election started coming in two days after the voting , the perception , whether right or wrong , was that the election had been stolen by the sitting government and the legitimate democratic voice of the country had not only been muffled but totally ignored . without a proper investigation into what happened during the elections and the vote tallying , which did have some serious and well-documented irregularities , it is impossible to know if the election was lost or stolen . so , was the violence that followed the announcement of the election results rooted more in the distrust between ethnic groups rather than opposition supporters against government followers ? the violence that ensued in kisumu and various other western kenyan towns was more a reflection of the anger of people seeing that they were going to be ignored and pushed aside again for another five years more than any ethnic animosity towards kikuyus themselves . what is the situation now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election violence is now fighting between tribes over the period of the past month , the situation has changed and we have been witnessing a growing balkanization taking place , supported either implicitly or explicitly by the various political leaders of both sides .
a growing resentment and violence towards the tribes rather than the political process has taken root with accelerating brutality and frequency of attacks taking place . are we in europe seeing the full picture of what is going on in kenya ? no matter what images you are seeing on the outside about the levels of violence and killings that are going on in kenya at the moment , the reality is actually worse , far worse than it is portrayed .
you don ’ t see the beheadings … you don ’ t hear the stories of people being buried alive .
it ’ s much , much worse . what is life like for you and the other expatriates who are living in nairobi ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in nairobi continues as daily riots rage in its slums despite the brutality of the killings and chaos that is engulfing the country at the moment there is a very strange , almost dreamlike , calm within nairobi with most people still going on about their normal lives .
although the violence and killings outside of nairobi and within the slum areas of the city have been almost continuous since the end of 2007 , only sporadic - although extremely violent - confrontations have spilled out onto the main areas of nairobi over that time . this has lead to the surreal events where friends have been having coffee in the junction , one of nairobi ’ s main shopping malls , and watching running battles outside of the gate between rioters and police with tear gas , clubs and machetes being used .
saying that , driving the children to school and trying to distract their attention away from the bodies lying at the side of the road from the previous days violence was not previously an everyday event . do you and your family , as white europeans , feel under any threat at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign tourists and expatriates are leaving kenya there hasn ’ t , as far as i know , been any violence or intimidation directed towards europeans at the moment , but the situation remains precarious .
talking to a number of friends , they tell me that they have already bought tickets back home , have their bags packed and are ready to leave . but there must be an increased level of danger ? the main danger for us is being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .
although we may not be specifically targeted at the moment , if you drive into a riot there may not be a whole lot of differentiation that either the rioters or the police may give .
one of the major issues for us in nairobi is the fact there are relatively few roads in and out of the city .
if anything happens on these roads then you can become effectively trapped in one area unable to move until the situation changes . my sons are still attending school , although rather sporadically at times , and were trapped at one end of the city during a riot while my wife and i where at the other end of the city , unable to get to them .
although they were fine and the situation resolved itself , the continuing uncertainty and immediacy of the violence here terrifies me .
i fear for the safety of my children on the school trips every morning as they have to cross over what have effectively been the main flash points for the riots over the past month , every morning and evening . how do you see your future in kenya , and the future of kenya itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of a return to normal life dwindles fast we have lived here for over eleven years and have bought land hoping to build a house that would be our home for the rest of our lives .
over the past month , all of that has changed with us wondering if this is even going to be our home next week . a large number of our friends here , mostly from various parts of europe or north america , have built lives and families here in kenya , positively choosing to stay here because of the beauty of the country and the people .
the kenya that we had grown to love , respect and admire is gone .
hopefully the country and its people will pull back from the brink and we can once again see a future and life here in kenya .
but those hopes dim with every new killing and retreat into tribalism . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.02.2008 inside kenya 's chaos : a european 's perspective großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while ethnic violence continues , europeans fear any escalation which could involve them the world has been shocked by the rapid downward spiral kenya has taken since the presidential elections in december .
in the midst of the tribal violence , europeans face a new reality in their adopted homeland . allan duncan is an independent economic consultant from the uk who works for a number of international organizations in kenya and neighboring sudan .
he and his family have been living in kenya for the past eleven years and have witnessed both the country 's long journey towards stability and its recent dramatic descent into violence and anarchy .
he talked to dw-world.de about life inside the current kenyan chaos . dw-world.de : before the current crisis , most europeans saw kenya as a relatively stable , progressive african nation with a booming tourism industry , and a higher standard of living than other countries on the continent .
was this a fair assessment ? allan duncan : kenya went through a period of transition from the old regime of daniel arap moi , the ex-president who handed over power in previous elections peacefully , to the kabaki government , which has seen significant economic growth and prosperity within the country over the past five years .
while there was still poverty and tensions , things on the whole were going well in the country - new businesses were opening , employment had increased and the middle classes of the country where buying their mercedes ’ and bmws .
all of that changed after the elections of dec .
27 last year . in your opinion , was it purely the presidential election results which sparked the violence ? the riots and deaths that quickly became the daily routine in the west of the country around kusumu , the main stronghold of the opposition presidential candidate , were portrayed as an ethnic fight between the luo -lrb- the opposition -rrb- and the kikuyu -lrb- the government -rrb- .
this , however , overly simplified what was actually going on at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unrest began with voters enraged at the political process kenya has had a history of tribal favoritism in terms of distribution of resources and positions of power since independence .
with the previous elections of 2002 , the country had voted en masse for a change to this distribution and ethos of the prevailing powers in the country .
change did happen , although within quite a short period of time , the establishment quickly reverted to the cronyism and corruption of the previous regimes that they had promised to eradicate . this was combined with a growing stranglehold on the means of production and political decision-making within kenya .
a resurgence of marginalization and poverty once again took root within the non-politically connected tribes fostering resentment and disaffection . what was the immediate atmosphere before and after the election ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president mwai kibaki is accused of stealing the vote with the lessons that people had learned from the 2002 elections , a growing ground swell of anti-government feeling began in the build-up to the 2007 elections .
when the results of the election started coming in two days after the voting , the perception , whether right or wrong , was that the election had been stolen by the sitting government and the legitimate democratic voice of the country had not only been muffled but totally ignored . without a proper investigation into what happened during the elections and the vote tallying , which did have some serious and well-documented irregularities , it is impossible to know if the election was lost or stolen . so , was the violence that followed the announcement of the election results rooted more in the distrust between ethnic groups rather than opposition supporters against government followers ? the violence that ensued in kisumu and various other western kenyan towns was more a reflection of the anger of people seeing that they were going to be ignored and pushed aside again for another five years more than any ethnic animosity towards kikuyus themselves . what is the situation now ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election violence is now fighting between tribes over the period of the past month , the situation has changed and we have been witnessing a growing balkanization taking place , supported either implicitly or explicitly by the various political leaders of both sides .
a growing resentment and violence towards the tribes rather than the political process has taken root with accelerating brutality and frequency of attacks taking place . are we in europe seeing the full picture of what is going on in kenya ? no matter what images you are seeing on the outside about the levels of violence and killings that are going on in kenya at the moment , the reality is actually worse , far worse than it is portrayed .
you don ’ t see the beheadings … you don ’ t hear the stories of people being buried alive .
it ’ s much , much worse . what is life like for you and the other expatriates who are living in nairobi ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life in nairobi continues as daily riots rage in its slums despite the brutality of the killings and chaos that is engulfing the country at the moment there is a very strange , almost dreamlike , calm within nairobi with most people still going on about their normal lives .
although the violence and killings outside of nairobi and within the slum areas of the city have been almost continuous since the end of 2007 , only sporadic - although extremely violent - confrontations have spilled out onto the main areas of nairobi over that time . this has lead to the surreal events where friends have been having coffee in the junction , one of nairobi ’ s main shopping malls , and watching running battles outside of the gate between rioters and police with tear gas , clubs and machetes being used .
saying that , driving the children to school and trying to distract their attention away from the bodies lying at the side of the road from the previous days violence was not previously an everyday event . do you and your family , as white europeans , feel under any threat at the moment ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign tourists and expatriates are leaving kenya there hasn ’ t , as far as i know , been any violence or intimidation directed towards europeans at the moment , but the situation remains precarious .
talking to a number of friends , they tell me that they have already bought tickets back home , have their bags packed and are ready to leave . but there must be an increased level of danger ? the main danger for us is being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time .
although we may not be specifically targeted at the moment , if you drive into a riot there may not be a whole lot of differentiation that either the rioters or the police may give .
one of the major issues for us in nairobi is the fact there are relatively few roads in and out of the city .
if anything happens on these roads then you can become effectively trapped in one area unable to move until the situation changes . my sons are still attending school , although rather sporadically at times , and were trapped at one end of the city during a riot while my wife and i where at the other end of the city , unable to get to them .
although they were fine and the situation resolved itself , the continuing uncertainty and immediacy of the violence here terrifies me .
i fear for the safety of my children on the school trips every morning as they have to cross over what have effectively been the main flash points for the riots over the past month , every morning and evening . how do you see your future in kenya , and the future of kenya itself ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of a return to normal life dwindles fast we have lived here for over eleven years and have bought land hoping to build a house that would be our home for the rest of our lives .
over the past month , all of that has changed with us wondering if this is even going to be our home next week . a large number of our friends here , mostly from various parts of europe or north america , have built lives and families here in kenya , positively choosing to stay here because of the beauty of the country and the people .
the kenya that we had grown to love , respect and admire is gone .
hopefully the country and its people will pull back from the brink and we can once again see a future and life here in kenya .
but those hopes dim with every new killing and retreat into tribalism . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .
naming a school after someone who had a leading function on this rocket project raises serious moral issues . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions . " strife plagues cabinet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic is pushing for serbia to intensify ties with the eu pro-europe president boris tadic , who was re-elected on sunday and whose party is part of kostunica 's ruling coalition , promised during his campaign to pursue eu membership regardless of kosovo 's future status . kosovo has been administered by the united nations since a nato campaign ended a war there in 1999 .
kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .
" if they sign , anything can happen with the government . " should the government fall , kostunica could either seek new elections or attempt to set up a new government by entering into a pact with nationalist serbian radical party , which is led by defeated presidential candidate tomislav nikolic . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .

the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .

he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .

walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .
naming a school after someone who had a leading function on this rocket project raises serious moral issues . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .
naming a school after someone who had a leading function on this rocket project raises serious moral issues . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .

walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .

berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .

but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .

aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .

despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .
no agreement , but dialogue poland 's new prime minister donald tusk has signaled he 's ready to talk about the project , although he did not say he supports it .
during tusk 's first state visit to germany , he suggested that germans participate in a joint european project for a world war ii museum .
he called for establishing a museum that takes the fate of the expellees into account " in a conclusive and comprehensive context " of the war as a whole .
merkel called the idea " interesting , " but did n't see it as a replacement for the german expellees project .

the proposed memorial has caused ongoing tension between germany and poland . more than 12 million ethnic germans were forced to leave their homes in central and eastern europe in the years following world war ii .
the hundreds of thousands of refugees who died as they fled east prussia , silesia , pomerania and sudetenland were some of the last victims of the war that began when adolf hitler invaded poland on sept .
1 , 1939 .
efforts to commemorate the expellee experience have proved to be an ongoing thorn in the relationships between germany and its neighbors , particularly poland .
in 2000 , the association of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , lead by erika steinbach , announced plans for a center against expulsions .
the center was opposed by germany 's ruling coalition , which at the time was made up of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbach remains a polarizing figure then-chancellor gerhard schröder 's coalition proposed instead a european-wide memorial to be planned together with germany 's neighbors .
the european network of memory and solidarity was created to plan the center , which was opposed by both the bdv and the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
changes in perspective yet when the government changed in 2005 , ushering angela merkel 's cdu-led coalition into a power-sharing agreement with the spd , the parties looked for a compromise .
they agreed that it was important for berlin to have a " visible symbol " against expulsion .
but instead of only focusing on german expellees , the exhibit would emphasize europe-wide issues of forced exile .
" our neighbors are invited to take part in the design , " the web site of germany 's culture ministry promised .
the german parliament designated 750,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.1 million -rrb- from the german parliament for the exhibit .
aggressors made victims ?
in poland and the czech republic the project has been controversial since it was introduced .
the germans want to turn aggressors into victims , warsaw has said .
the criticism was particularly strong during the kaczynski brothers ' time in office .
while jaroslaw kaczynski has since stepped down as premier , his twin , lech , still serves as polish president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disagreement persist on how to portray expellees the poles also objected to erika steinbach 's involvement in any project having to do with commemorating expellees .
as the head of the association of expellees , steinbach is seen in poland as a symbol for german revisionism about the war .
despite steinbach 's efforts to modernize the group , there has been anger over support for ongoing claims some expellees have make on land lost after the war .
steinbach 's critics , who include the spd , have been adamant that she not play a role in germany 's expellee project .

the latest , and possibly last , has also failed . italy 's attempts to reform the political system and electoral laws which have led to successive failures and instability once again floundered as italian senate speaker franco marini returned his mandate to form a government to president giorgio napolitano .
marini ended three days of consultations with political leaders to see if they would back him in forming a government after romano prodi 's resignation as centre-left premier on jan .
24 left italy in another political vacuum .
the failure to find a consensus could pave the way for snap elections .
president napolitano had given marini the task of assessing support for a new regime , the main objective being the reform of italy 's political culture to allow for more stable future governments .
napolitano , who has the power to dissolve parliament and set new elections , but who also believes in the need to reform the electoral law , had hoped that the 74-year-old marini , a center-left catholic and former labor union leader , would muster enough support to form a government .
berlusconi blocks deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi called for new elections marini had been given support by most of the country 's leading center-left political leaders along with business and labor representatives but was opposed by center-right politicians , led by former premier and center-right opposition leader silvio berlusconi and his forza italia party , which insisted that new elections be held under the current electoral law .
" i returned the mandate to the president , disappointed by the impossibility to achieve the objective which is necessary for the country - changing the electoral law , " marini told reporters following an evening meeting with the president .
" i could not find a significant majority . "
berlusconi meanwhile said that new elections would be " the best thing . "
" what is needed is a government elected by the people that can be immediately operational , " berlusconi said following his meeting with marini earlier monday .
berlusconi , eyeing a possible return to power , said he hoped " napolitano calls an election immediately . "
" we hope - and we think that 's what will happen - that ... the head of state will call elections immediately , because the country quickly needs an efficient government to solve its grave problems , " berlusconi said .
" according to the polls we of the center-right have a lead of between 10 and 16 percent , " said berlusconi , stressing that such a majority would allow him , as candidate premier for the opposition , to form a strong government .
berlusconi also said he believed the current electoral law can give " excellent results . "
another center-right leader , gianfranco fini of the national alliance , who had met marini earlier , echoed the billionaire former premier 's words and called for new elections .

president napolitano is now expected to give the center-right what they want and call new elections , most likely to take place by mid-april .
walter veltroni , prodi 's heir as center-left leader who would face berlusconi in an election , had hoped for a longer delay in calling elections to allow a chance for reform .
" i think this risks being a missed opportunity for italian politics , rushing towards elections with a flawed law , " he said .
italy 's current electoral system - introduced just before the april 2006 elections by the center-right government of berlusconi , who was then premier - favors small parties which are then often in a position to dictate terms within government .
prodi 's government - italy 's 61st since world war ii - an unwieldy coalition of nine parties ranging from moderate catholics to diehard communists , saw its already slim majority in the senate vanish completely through the defection of two small parties . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 05.02.2008 czech presidential election highlights resilient grudges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential candidate jan svejnar faces criticism and the old guard in his bid for election despite all the eu trappings which give the czech republic the impression of a fully-integrated member state , the old divisions from the country 's early post-communist days still remain engrained in its political fabric . the czech republic may have been an eu member for four years and is currently still enjoying the flush of joining the bloc 's passport-free schengen zone at the end of 2007 , but old rivalries , like that fostered by bitter arch-foes and former presidents vaclav havel and vaclav klaus , hark back to a darker time .
highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .
challenger accused of being an outsider bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic joined the eu in 2004 not surprisingly , klaus ' supporters in the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which he once co-founded and chaired , were among those who attacked svejnar for being an outsider , whose us wife does not even speak czech .
" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .
still he prefers not to be seen as a havel man .

" i ca n't imagine that the czech republic would be led by someone , who arrives here as if on a safari , " ods interior minister ivan langer told the tyden weekly .
" for me vaclav klaus is the czech republic and jan svejnar -lsb- is -rsb- hunter , who arrives here to fire away and have fun . "
many on the right and left have attacked svejnar for being an emigrant ; a status frowned upon in the post-communist czech republic .
after communism fell in 1989 , svejnar has split time , if unevenly , between teaching economics at us universities and running an academic institute in prague .
havel has defended svejnar , who has been so surprised by the attacks that he has promised to give up his us citizenship if he was elected .
cosmopolitan svejnar surprised at criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution of 1989 brought the communist government down " i thought we are almost 20 years after the -lrb- 1989 velvet -rrb- revolution ... so i expected that actually there would be something attractive about a person who has roots here , lived here , then gathered education and experience abroad , " the underdog candidate said .
as a teenager in 1970 , svejnar emigrated from the then czechoslovakia .
he and his younger sister boarded a train to geneva to join their parents , as their father was representing prague at the international labor organization there .
the young man then settled in the united states , where he is now an economics professor at the university of michigan .
since his campaign kicked off in the fall , svejnar has been the first to openly say what havel has so far only hinted at .
in desperate need of the communist vote , this communist-era exile spoke out against the hypocrisy , with which politicians have treated the outcasts of the czech democratic politics - the communists .
" virtually everybody is doing deals with them and sometimes behind closed doors , because there is this unease -lrb- about -rrb- what this party is , " svejnar said .
communists may hold key but suspicion remains the czech communists have not shed their name and still have some dogmatic stalinists in their ranks , but shutting them out has caused the country to have too many weak governments .
svejnar , however , said that he would not break the taboo and bring the communists back to the government .
" i think that we are not in that situation yet , " he said .
" they are not interested in joining the government and i think they have not carried out the transformation yet . "
unlike euroskeptic klaus and like pro-european havel , svejnar supports a strong civil society , measures to curb global warming and the speedy adoption of the euro .

highlighting the divides in the country is the upcoming presidential election which pits incumbent president klaus against the czech-us economist jan svejnar .
klaus is of the old guard - a conservative representative of the pragmatic yet somewhat provincial czech patriots .
svejnar is a cosmopolitan idealist , who appeals to the somewhat elitist havel-style liberals .
it is a familiar contest of conflicting views and style which has endured behind the scenes of the czech republic 's march of progress .
" we all know from the start that mr. svejnar is vaclav havel 's candidate , " klaus recently said of his rival , a former havel adviser , in a thinly-veiled insult .

he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .
" we think it 's a good offer , and at the same time we understand very well that ... they have to undergo internal discussions .

kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future . " but infrastructure minister velimir ilic , a kostunica ally , said signing the accord could spell the end of the cabinet . " thursday is d-day , " he said .

he said it was a part of the western plan to sever serbia of kosovo . a political accord with the eu , scheduled to be signed on thursday , would bring belgrade closer to the eu by relaxing visa requirements and increasing trade relations , but prime minister vojislav kostunica said signing the agreement would amount to giving away kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of kostunica 's government say it may collapse if belgrade signs a deal with the eu " the political agreement that the eu has proposed while it deploys a mission to dismember our country is a deception , " kostunica said in a statement , paving the way to a government crisis .
" by signing , serbia would indirectly recognize the independence of kosovo . "
brussels sees the accord as a signal affirming serbia 's european perspective .
but eu countries have also continued preparing a civilian law-enforcement mission for deployment in kosovo once it declares independence , presumably within days , despite strong opposition from belgrade to both plans . in brussels , the spokeswoman of eu foreign policy chief javier solana said nothing stood in the way of signing the accord on thursday . " we 'd like very much to sign , " cristina gallach said .

kosovar politicians are united by a desire to declare independence , which they have said they will do by the end of february . belgrade , however , has promised to use all peaceful means at its disposal to prevent the province , which has a 90-percent ethnic albanian population , from breaking away . hoping the parliament could keep tadic from signing the agreement with the eu , kostunica has called the assembly to discuss the eu deal and the bloc 's plan to deploy a law-enforcement mission . but oliver dulic , the parliament 's speaker and a tadic ally , has so far refused to call for an extraordinary parliamentary session , despite laws mandating that it occur .
instead he said he would consult with party leaders and convene the assembly on monday - after the deal is signed on thursday . many observers expected that the eu agreement would shatter the coalition of tadic and kostunica , as the conservative prime minister shares the view of the nationalist opposition that serbia should turn away from the eu in protest at its support of kosovo . government 's future hangs in balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nikolic could play a role in a new kostunica government should the current one collapse deputy prime minister bozidar djelic of tadic 's democratic party said sunday 's election result clearly showed that the people of serbia wanted to work towards eu membership . economy minister mladjan dinkic also said " there could not , and would not , be any compromise on serbia 's european future .

the number of st. mary 's , st. joseph 's and other canonized figures lending their names to schools suggest that many local authorities hope , mostly in vain , to turn out generations of little saints into the world .
others choose intellectuals or statesmen for similar reasons .
the people of bernstadt auf dem eigen , a small town in eastern germany near the czech and polish border , have chosen a somewhat more controversial namesake for their secondary school .
they want to rename it after the nazi scientist who helped build the v-2 rockets launched against allied targets during world war ii .
town officials have decided to give klaus riedel 's name to its school to mark the centenary of his birth despite the central role he played in the nazis ' development of the v-2 rocket program and the fact that slave laborers were used to build his creations which fell mostly on antwerp and london , killing thousands in the process .
unsurprisingly , bernstadt auf dem eigen 's decision has placed the town in the crosshairs of outraged citizens and politicians .
concern over npd patronage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd often rallies at sites with nazi significance " if the -lsb- far-right extremist party -rsb- npd find out that there 's a monument to one of the people behind the v-2 rocket , then i 'd be extremely worried they 're going to hold rallies all the time there , " astrid günther-schmidt , a green party member of saxony 's state parliament in eastern germany , said , adding that the naming of the school after the rocket pioneer was completely inappropriate .
the npd , which has been compared to the nazi party , enjoys significant support in bernstadt 's state of saxony and won more than 9 percent of votes in the last regional election .
" -lsb- the local authorities -rsb- should make clear forced laborers made the v-2 under the most inhuman conditions , that there were mass executions there every week ... and publicly attest to knowing this - then explain why they chose the name , " günther-schmidt said .
historical estimates put the number of slave laborers who died during their work on the v-2 project at 20,000 with an additional estimate of 7,000 military and private persons killed by the rockets themselves during the last months of the war .
riedel a pioneer of german science , says mayor the town 's mayor , gunter lange , rejected claims that riedel was a nazi and said he stood by the decision to rename the school after a man who he said deserved recognition for his contributions to rocket science .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the v-2 caused devastation across europe , mostly in london " the name klaus riedel has been a fixture in the town for many years , " lange told reuters .
" there 's been a monument to him here since the 1990s .
there 's a crater on the moon named after him .
and nobody has ever been bothered by it until now . "
he conceded , however , that the choice of riedel , who died in an automobile accident in 1944 , was " problematic " and he would discuss it at the next meeting of the town council .
riedel helped to develop the mobile launch pads for the v-2 , the first ballistic missile and first man-made object to achieve sub-orbital spaceflight .
he worked closely with wernher von braun , the father of german rocket technology , becoming his deputy and chief designer .
historians skeptical of riedel 's claim of ignorance it is his close working relationship with von braun which convinces many historians that , far from being an innocent scientist , riedel was well aware of what the nazis were planning .
" these people bear a heavy burden of guilt , " johannes weyer , an expert on sociological technology studies at dortmund 's technical university , told reuters .
" you ca n't develop rockets for the nazis and simultaneously be against them .

germany 's latest animal sweetheart is being primed for stardom and is being given a spacious enclosure from which to launch her career .
her new pad , however , has a gory history . some people believe that locations which have witnessed traumatic events absorb the negative energy expelled at the scene and manifest it for years to come as eerie phenomena .
they say the bad vibes given off by murders and psychological abuse can re-appear as ghostly apparitions ; the shadows of malevolent spiritual events , the horror of the past being played back in the present , as it were .
those who believe that scenes of pain and suffering retain some of that violently expelled energy may question the current plans of the nuremberg zoo to house germany 's latest animal star in the " cave of death . "
new polar bear celebrity flocke , the cub born in december and saved from a fate worse than death by her keepers , will soon move into the prime bit of real estate being vacated by the notorious child killer , vilma the baby eater .
the animal equivalent of the bates motel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flocke 's mum vera was suspected of plotting infanticide the murderess vilma shocked germany in january when she snacked on her two recently-born offspring in " a moment of stress . "
flocke 's own mother , vera , a confidante of vilma , was suspected of plotting her own infanticide which led to the intervention by zoo keepers to save flocke .
now as the nuremberg zoo plans to promote flocke as the new knut , berlin 's global mega-bear , some believe that starting the young cub on the road to stardom from such a gruesome location is a potential disaster of britney spears proportions .
exposing the bear to the world 's media while housing her in a crime scene inhabited by the ghosts of her murdered childhood friends could be hugely damaging to flocke 's developing psyche .
it could potentially lead to severe psychological problems in the future .
years down the line , who 's to say the world wo n't be watching a heavily tattooed flocke being photographed having her fur shaved off or stepping out of secure transport vehicles without her underwear ?
fleeting fame or long-term psychosis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another wayward celebrity exhibits fame 's downside however , it appears that the zoo authorities are more concerned with the here and now .
flocke will go on show at the " cave of death " in the spring and the clamor is expected to match that which surrounded knut for the months before he got old , fat and left to deal with the trauma of sniffing german environment minister sigmar gabriel 's crotch alone and without therapy .
time will tell if young flocke can survive the media circus which is bound to engulf her and , more importantly , whether the ghosts of the past will leave her in peace . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she was born in australia but lived in england for five years when she was young . " i guess i do n't sound terribly aussie on the air " , she says .
" but there 's a good reason for that .
when i arrived in england in the 1960 's from australia , the kids at school used to tease me all the time because of my aussie accent .
it used to drive me nuts so the accent had to go !
unfortunately , when i got went back to australia in 1975 , i sounded so posh that i got teased again for being a pom !
i just could n't win . "
after doing her bachelor of arts in history and then a postgraduate degree in library science in her homestate of queensland , she finally decided journalism was for her and went back for a degree in journalism .
" i knew i was on the right track when i won a journalism award for the queensland division of the institution of engineers in australia .
you see , i did n't know a thing about engineering , but i knew i could write ! "

mr de venecia - a former ally of president arroyo - was removed from his position in a house of representatives vote late on monday .
he had been in the role for 12 years , and was the longest-serving house speaker in philippine history .
after being ousted , he told parliament he was going to join the opposition .
mr de venecia 's removal is seen by analysts as strengthening mrs arroyo 's control over the house of representatives .
friend turned foe mr de venecia was once one of mrs arroyo 's most trusted allies .
he led mps in crushing three opposition attempts to impeach her , over claims of vote-rigging , corruption and human rights abuses .
their close relationship frayed when the former speaker 's son , jose " joey " de venecia iii , told an inquiry that mrs arroyo 's husband had been involved in bribery in connection with a government contract .
in a speech before monday night 's vote , mr de venecia stood by his son , and accused the government of corruption .
" what is happening in our country ?
everything is for sale ?

the 20cm -lrb- 8in -rrb- juvenile loggerhead turtle was discovered on putsborough beach , near woolacombe , and taken to the blue reef aquarium in newquay .
it is the second such turtle to be found in the south west in a week .
the aquarium said it was rare to find two such turtles and it was doing what it could so they could be released back into the wild .
it 's rare for two turtles to strand within such a short space of time matt slater the first turtle was found by a woman out walking on blackrock beach , near bude , last week .
both are now recovering at the aquarium in special quarantine tanks after receiving a veterinary examination .
blue reef curator matt slater said : " it 's rare for two turtles to strand within such a short space of time .
" it 's even more unusual for both of them to survive their ordeal and we 're now doing everything we can to ensure they make a full recovery and can be released back into the wild . "
loggerheads -lrb- caretta caretta -rrb- are categorised as endangered on the internationally-recognised red list of threatened species .
colder waters mr slater said : " most loggerheads are born along the coast of mexico and florida , although there are separate populations in the mediterranean and the middle east .
" during their first three years of life , many loggerheads migrate to the warmer waters of the atlantic , circulating in a current of water known as the north atlantic gyre , which is rich in their favourite food , including jellyfish and squid .
" we believe both turtles were probably born on a beach in america or mexico and , somehow , possibly following a severe storm , ended up getting pushed out of the gyre and further and further north .
" most turtles are cold-blooded and , as they headed towards the uk coast , the colder waters would have initially stopped them feeding and eventually led them to become virtually unconscious . "

the 20cm -lrb- 8in -rrb- juvenile loggerhead turtle was discovered on putsborough beach , near woolacombe , and taken to the blue reef aquarium in newquay .
it is the second such turtle to be found in the south west in a week .

both are now recovering at the aquarium in special quarantine tanks after receiving a veterinary examination .
blue reef curator matt slater said : " it 's rare for two turtles to strand within such a short space of time .

" during their first three years of life , many loggerheads migrate to the warmer waters of the atlantic , circulating in a current of water known as the north atlantic gyre , which is rich in their favourite food , including jellyfish and squid .
" we believe both turtles were probably born on a beach in america or mexico and , somehow , possibly following a severe storm , ended up getting pushed out of the gyre and further and further north .
" most turtles are cold-blooded and , as they headed towards the uk coast , the colder waters would have initially stopped them feeding and eventually led them to become virtually unconscious . "

wellcome trust head dr mark walport has announced the body is to boost spending by 60 % - to £ 4bn over the five years .
he said the aim was to understand the genetics and development of common killer diseases , such as heart disease , stroke and cancers .
and he added : " this is an incredibly exciting time for science . "
he said an important aim will be to translate the information gleaned from the human genome project into a real understanding of some of the world 's biggest killers .
one of our priorities is to increase our understanding of common human diseases at the genetic level dr mark walport , of the wellcome trust brain disorders and mental illness will also be a priority .
he said these are complex diseases involving several genes and environmental factors .
but the wellcome trust believe that with a heavy investment in research scientists can make real progress .
" one of our priorities is to increase our understanding of common human diseases at the genetic level .
" developments in technology have meant we can now do this kind of science on a scale that we 've not been able to before . "
the wellcome trust has already invested £ 28m in the biobank project .
this is the biggest project of its kind in the world , which aims to discover the relationship between genetic make up and environmental factors .
the trust has already invested £ 17m in the case control consortium , which aims to identify genes involved in common diseases - an additional £ 30m is already earmarked for the next phase of this kind of research .
' tip of the iceberg ' but this already substantial backing is " just the tip of the iceberg , " of what 's likely to follow , according to dr walport .
" the genetic influences on health are very profound .
" it 's a big step from identifying genes to understanding the disease process and then devising treatments - and that requires a heavy investment in resources . "
neuroscience is also high on dr walport 's list of priorities .
not just the brain disorders such as alzheimer 's and parkinson 's disease - but mental illness which he believes has been relatively neglected by the research community .
as well as investing more in research , dr walport wants to see a similar increase in funding the public 's understanding of that research .
he believes that the two go hand-in-hand .
he cites recent concerns over embryo research as an example where it 's been important for the public to be properly informed about the science in order to make a rational choice about what they - and ultimately parliament feels to be acceptable .
" people can have whatever views they want on controversial topics such as embryo research .
but it 's important that that those views are based on information rather than disinformation . "

france , which has 1,400 troops in chad , said it hoped it would not have to use the mandate and intervene further .
the french foreign minister said the government of chadian president idriss deby was in control of the capital n 'djamena " for the time being " .
earlier , thousands of people fled the city during a lull in fighting .
many crossed the river border with cameroon via the ngueli bridge or by using boats .
we do not intend to put french troops more on alert than they are , or to start military operations bernard kouchner french foreign minister french diplomatic tight-rope local officials told the un refugee agency that thousands were also crossing at the border town of kousseri and that more were expected .
aid workers have reported hundreds of injuries to civilians resulting from the intense battles near the presidential palace , with bodies lying in the streets .
international support after late-night negotiations , un diplomats agreed a statement condemning the attacks by the rebels , who want to overthrow president deby , and demanding an end to the violence .

following the meeting , the us permanent representative , zalmay khalilzad , said the french had " the expertise and lead on this issue , and should they decide to do more , they have the support of the security council " .
bbc world affairs correspondent mark doyle says the un statement presents the french with political and strategic problems .
the french army enjoys its historic military influence in africa and quietly backs president deby with weapons and military intelligence , our correspondent says .
but , at the same time , france wants to pursue a modern , european destiny - it wants a french-dominated european union peacekeeping force , including irish and polish troops , to intervene in the crisis , he adds .
the rebels have previously threatened to attack the force because of france 's support for the chadian government , forcing its deployment to be delayed .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he " hoped " his country 's armed forces would " not have to intervene further " to support president deby .
" we do not intend to put french troops more on alert than they are , or to start military operations , " he said .
mr kouchner said that most of n 'djamena was in the government 's hands , but cautioned that the rebels were still operating on its outskirts .
' window on genocide ' earlier , the commander the chadian government forces , gen mahamat ali abdallah , said the rebels had been " completely routed " in the capital .
however , a rebel spokesman , abderaman koulamallah , rejected the claim .
we have pulled out of the city and we are waiting for the civilian population to be evacuated abderaman koulamallah rebel spokesman ' revolution 's going on ' profile : idriss deby " we have pulled out of the city and we are waiting for the civilian population to be evacuated , " he told afp news agency .
" we certainly will go back on the offensive . "
the army has also said it had thwarted a second rebel attack on adre , near the border with sudan over the weekend .
the town is where some 240,000 refugees from darfur are based , living in camps and where the eu force is due to deploy .
the 3,700-strong eu force is intended to protect refugees from the darfur region of neighbouring sudan , as well as aid workers .

sudan denies this , as well as accusations that it has supported arab militias accused of ethnic cleansing and genocide in darfur .
the recent violence began on saturday , when the rebels seized control of large parts of the capital , approaching the palace where president deby was holding out .
mr deby seized power in a coup in 1990 , but has won three elections since then , although their legitimacy has been challenged .

france , which has 1,400 troops in chad , said it hoped it would not have to use the mandate and intervene further .
the french foreign minister said the government of chadian president idriss deby was in control of the capital n 'djamena " for the time being " .
earlier , thousands of people fled the city during a lull in fighting .
many crossed the river border with cameroon via the ngueli bridge or by using boats .
we do not intend to put french troops more on alert than they are , or to start military operations bernard kouchner french foreign minister french diplomatic tight-rope local officials told the un refugee agency that thousands were also crossing at the border town of kousseri and that more were expected .
aid workers have reported hundreds of injuries to civilians resulting from the intense battles near the presidential palace , with bodies lying in the streets .
international support after late-night negotiations , un diplomats agreed a statement condemning the attacks by the rebels , who want to overthrow president deby , and demanding an end to the violence .
the non-binding statement also gave the green light for countries to " provide support , in conformity with the united nations charter , as requested by the government of chad " .

following the meeting , the us permanent representative , zalmay khalilzad , said the french had " the expertise and lead on this issue , and should they decide to do more , they have the support of the security council " .
bbc world affairs correspondent mark doyle says the un statement presents the french with political and strategic problems .
the french army enjoys its historic military influence in africa and quietly backs president deby with weapons and military intelligence , our correspondent says .
but , at the same time , france wants to pursue a modern , european destiny - it wants a french-dominated european union peacekeeping force , including irish and polish troops , to intervene in the crisis , he adds .
the rebels have previously threatened to attack the force because of france 's support for the chadian government , forcing its deployment to be delayed .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said he " hoped " his country 's armed forces would " not have to intervene further " to support president deby .
" we do not intend to put french troops more on alert than they are , or to start military operations , " he said .
mr kouchner said that most of n 'djamena was in the government 's hands , but cautioned that the rebels were still operating on its outskirts .
' window on genocide ' earlier , the commander the chadian government forces , gen mahamat ali abdallah , said the rebels had been " completely routed " in the capital .
however , a rebel spokesman , abderaman koulamallah , rejected the claim .
we have pulled out of the city and we are waiting for the civilian population to be evacuated abderaman koulamallah rebel spokesman ' revolution 's going on ' profile : idriss deby " we have pulled out of the city and we are waiting for the civilian population to be evacuated , " he told afp news agency .
" we certainly will go back on the offensive . "
the army has also said it had thwarted a second rebel attack on adre , near the border with sudan over the weekend .
the town is where some 240,000 refugees from darfur are based , living in camps and where the eu force is due to deploy .
the 3,700-strong eu force is intended to protect refugees from the darfur region of neighbouring sudan , as well as aid workers .

cue much mockery from political opponents and derision from many living in the north-east london borough .
among the detractors was labour mp for hackney north and stoke newington , diane abbott .
in an attempt to set the record straight , she invited the commons home affairs select committee along for a late-night walkabout .
and so it came to pass that three labour members - chairman keith vaz and colleagues gwyn prosser and karen buck - did take to the streets of n16 .
a chilly hour-long stroll took in a couple of shops , a couple of restaurants and several cheery hellos for passers-by .
but how much serious fact-finding can four mps hope to achieve when outnumbered at least four-to-one by press and broadcasters ?
' so far so good ' the church street supermarket seemed a good bet for mr vaz to begin his inquiries about local crime and policing .
manager bulent gurgur said most local folk were decent sorts , although some drank a little too much . "
hackney seems a very nice place to come to .
there have been a lot of bad stories about the place but i can ' t see it " gwyn prosser , mp for dover he added : " it 's been so far so good .
the police come every day because they are regular customers . "
mr vaz asked : " not for the drink ? "
to which mr gurgur replied : " no .
they do n't drink . "
a few handshakes later it was on to the next destination .
at the royal india curryhouse , owner saifur alam embraced the mps , saying : " we need to understand each other and respect each other .
this lovely lady -lsb- ms abbott -rsb- represents us .
" crime has gone down .
we 've got cameras .
we have never had any trouble here . "
butternut squash all was sweetness and light .
as the entourage moved on , a group of young people looked at the mps and asked : " who are they ? "
when informed by journalists , they seemed none the wiser .
the same blank expression appeared on the faces of drinkers in the coach and horses and the passengers on the number 73 bus , as bulbs flashed and the mps wandered into the mediterranean supermarket .
mr prosser , the genial mp for dover , said : " hackney seems a very nice place to come to .
there have been a lot of bad stories about the place but i ca n't see it . "
back outside the supermarket , mr vaz sniffed an onion and inspected a butternut squash for the cameras .
afterwards , manager sawaz bedr said : " i do n't have any idea what that was all about .
i 've never seen them before .
" they are welcome to come in again , and maybe buy something . "
gangs and weapons the tone became more serious as the mps visited the smalley road estate , where 17-year-old etem celebi was shot dead last november .
it was a reminder that london can be dangerous and of the problems of gangs and a weapons culture .
mr vaz emerged from the estate and , sounding increasingly like a cross between a hackney tourism officer and a cheerleader , said : " it 's a quiet area and it 's a lovely estate , and it 's very safe .
" the fact that it 's dark has made no difference . "
ms abbott said : " i was disappointed when the home secretary said she would be wary of walking around after dark . "
fall in crime she added : " there are ordinary people going out to bars , restaurants and clubs and they have nothing to fear .
" i would like the home secretary to come and i 'm optimistic that she will ...
" i think it 's very important that politicians do n't feed a climate of fear .
i do n't think a woman should be frightened to come here .
i still walk around after dark . "
official figures suggest hackney is getting safer , with violent crime down .
that was certainly the message mr vaz and ms abbott were keen to give .
whether the walkabout will be enough to convince ms smith - and a lot of other doubters - is another matter altogether .

cue much mockery from political opponents and derision from many living in the north-east london borough .
among the detractors was labour mp for hackney north and stoke newington , diane abbott .
jacqui smith 's comments came in an interview in january in an attempt to set the record straight , she invited the commons home affairs select committee along for a late-night walkabout .
and so it came to pass that three labour members - chairman keith vaz and colleagues gwyn prosser and karen buck - did take to the streets of n16 .
a chilly hour-long stroll took in a couple of shops , a couple of restaurants and several cheery hellos for passers-by .
but how much serious fact-finding can four mps hope to achieve when outnumbered at least four-to-one by press and broadcasters ?
' so far so good ' the church street supermarket seemed a good bet for mr vaz to begin his inquiries about local crime and policing .
manager bulent gurgur said most local folk were decent sorts , although some drank a little too much .
hackney seems a very nice place to come to .
there have been a lot of bad stories about the place but i can ' t see it gwyn prosser , mp for dover he added : " it 's been so far so good .
the police come every day because they are regular customers . "
mr vaz asked : " not for the drink ? "
to which mr gurgur replied : " no .
they do n't drink . "
a few handshakes later it was on to the next destination .
at the royal india curryhouse , owner saifur alam embraced the mps , saying : " we need to understand each other and respect each other .
this lovely lady -lsb- ms abbott -rsb- represents us .
" crime has gone down .
we 've got cameras .
we have never had any trouble here . "
butternut squash all was sweetness and light .
as the entourage moved on , a group of young people looked at the mps and asked : " who are they ? "
when informed by journalists , they seemed none the wiser .
keith vaz and diane abbott hear from a shopkeeper , left the same blank expression appeared on the faces of drinkers in the coach and horses and the passengers on the number 73 bus , as bulbs flashed and the mps wandered into the mediterranean supermarket .
mr prosser , the genial mp for dover , said : " hackney seems a very nice place to come to .
there have been a lot of bad stories about the place but i ca n't see it . "
back outside the supermarket , mr vaz sniffed an onion and inspected a butternut squash for the cameras .
afterwards , manager sawaz bedr said : " i do n't have any idea what that was all about .
i 've never seen them before .
" they are welcome to come in again , and maybe buy something . "
gangs and weapons the tone became more serious as the mps visited the smalley road estate , where 17-year-old etem celebi was shot dead last november .
it was a reminder that london can be dangerous and of the problems of gangs and a weapons culture .
mr vaz emerged from the estate and , sounding increasingly like a cross between a hackney tourism officer and a cheerleader , said : " it 's a quiet area and it 's a lovely estate , and it 's very safe .
" the fact that it 's dark has made no difference . "
ms abbott said : " i was disappointed when the home secretary said she would be wary of walking around after dark . "
fall in crime she added : " there are ordinary people going out to bars , restaurants and clubs and they have nothing to fear .
" i would like the home secretary to come and i 'm optimistic that she will ...
" i think it 's very important that politicians do n't feed a climate of fear .
i do n't think a woman should be frightened to come here .
i still walk around after dark . "
official figures suggest hackney is getting safer , with violent crime down .
that was certainly the message mr vaz and ms abbott were keen to give .
whether the walkabout will be enough to convince ms smith - and a lot of other doubters - is another matter altogether .

judge florence-marie cooper overturned an exemption granted last month by president george w bush .
he had cited national security when he ordered the navy 's submarine detection exercises should go on .
conservationists hailed the judge 's ruling .
it is the latest in a series of disputes over the navy 's use of sonar .
environmental campaign groups led by the natural resources defense council -lrb- nrcd -rrb- say whale strandings and deaths are associated with sonar blasts , which are also thought to damage the brains and ears of marine mammals .
constitutional question judge cooper ruled that there was no reason to exempt the navy from a court injunction barring the use of powerful submarine-detecting radar in a 12-mile zone off southern california , which is a habitat for dolphins , whales and other animals .
the injunction stipulates that all sonar be switched off if marine mammals are spotted within 2,200 yards -lrb- 2,012m -rrb- .
the judge also expressed " significant concerns " about the constitutionality of president bush 's exemption .
" it 's an excellent decision , " nrdc attorney joel reynolds told the associated press news agency .
" it reinstates the proper balance between national security and environmental protection . "
but white house spokesman tony fratto said the administration disagreed with the judge 's decision .
" we believe the orders are legal and appropriate , " he said , according to ap .
when he signed a waiver on the injunction on 15 january , president bush said it would " undermine the navy 's ability to conduct realistic training exercises " .

so say researchers and developers who are finding ways to make the tiny devices much more than just a hi-tech price tag that can help shops and supermarkets track cans of beans from warehouse to store shelf .
" it all started with simple radio tags and asset tracking , " said gerd kortuem , " but that really only gives you an identifier for an object . "
now , said dr kortuem , tiny radio frequency id -lrb- rfid -rrb- tags are getting smarter and more communicative as bigger memory , basic processing power and wireless technologies are added to them .
" we are trying to embed a little more intelligence beyond location by adding sensors and by networking these objects together , " he said .
safe and sound dr kortuem and colleagues at the university of lancaster are working on a project that combines smart tags and personal identifiers to keep an eye on people working on construction sites using heavy machine tools .
" it 's to keep track of how long they are used , to figure out vibrations generated by these tools , " he said .
" it 's for health and safety .
we create personalised health and safety records for every worker . "
the future of the internet is an internet of connected objects jean-francois kitten " the current way of generating this data is after the fact and no-one really cares about it , " he said .
" there is legislation and companies need to generate the data , they need to prove that they comply with the legislation . "
workers will also be able to look at their own health records to get a sense of their exposure to potentially harmful working environments and raise awareness of the dangers .
for instance , prolonged exposure to vibrations from drills and other tools can lead to a condition called " vibration white finger " that can leave extremities numb and painful .
many hardware makers , such as router maker cisco , are also starting to put smarter tags on devices so they can keep a record of their working life and can call for help if they are about to fail or are in need of servicing .
smarter homes in the home too some gadgets are starting to use rfid tags to become smarter and help their owners cope with the pace of modern life .
the latest version of the nabaztag wi-fi rabbit gadget has been fitted with a sensor that can interrogate the radio tags .
the rabbit can also read out e-mails , monitor rss feeds and the weather for its owners .
rival devices such as the chumby and tux droid perform similar functions .
the rabbit can recognise lots of different objects violet , the creators of the rabbit have signed a deal with gallimard jeunesse to put rfid tags on books produced by the french publisher .
jean-francois kitten , a spokesman for violet , said at first only five titles , some stories and some educational , would have tags but more were expected soon .
when a tagged book is waved under the nabaztag 's nose it pulls a recording of a story being read from the net and begins to play it .
moving the rabbit 's ears lets listeners skip forward or back in the text .
the rabbit also remembers where it reached in the book so , in the case of a story , it can pick up at the right place in the action when listeners want to continue .
" in the average house you have about 10,000 different objects and right now you have maybe three objects connected to the net - phone , computer and perhaps a rabbit , " he said .
" but we think that more and more objects are going to be connected , " said mr kitten .
mr kitten said putting tags on books had huge potential .
for instance , he said , a tagged book could become a key to future content if a novel was made in to a film or game .
when the rabbit read the tag its owner would get the chance to watch the movie online or download a game .
" it 's a pedagogical way to explain what you can do with rfid and interactive objects , " he said .
violet also had plans to sell rfid stamps , or ztamps , that can be stuck on any object which can then be associated with almost any net content .
when they go on sale three ztamps will cost £ 1 -lrb- 1.34 euros -rrb- .
nabaztag owners will be able to customise what happens when a tagged object is waved under the nose of their wi-fi rabbit .
" the future of the internet is an internet of connected objects , " he said .

safe and sound dr kortuem and colleagues at the university of lancaster are working on a project that combines smart tags and personal identifiers to keep an eye on people working on construction sites using heavy machine tools .
" it 's to keep track of how long they are used , to figure out vibrations generated by these tools , " he said .

we create personalised health and safety records for every worker . "
the future of the internet is an internet of connected objects jean-francois kitten " the current way of generating this data is after the fact and no-one really cares about it , " he said .
" there is legislation and companies need to generate the data , they need to prove that they comply with the legislation . "
workers will also be able to look at their own health records to get a sense of their exposure to potentially harmful working environments and raise awareness of the dangers .
for instance , prolonged exposure to vibrations from drills and other tools can lead to a condition called " vibration white finger " that can leave extremities numb and painful .
many hardware makers , such as router maker cisco , are also starting to put smarter tags on devices so they can keep a record of their working life and can call for help if they are about to fail or are in need of servicing .
smarter homes in the home too some gadgets are starting to use rfid tags to become smarter and help their owners cope with the pace of modern life .
the latest version of the nabaztag wi-fi rabbit gadget has been fitted with a sensor that can interrogate the radio tags .
the rabbit can also read out e-mails , monitor rss feeds and the weather for its owners .
rival devices such as the chumby and tux droid perform similar functions .
the rabbit can recognise lots of different objects violet , the creators of the rabbit have signed a deal with gallimard jeunesse to put rfid tags on books produced by the french publisher .
jean-francois kitten , a spokesman for violet , said at first only five titles , some stories and some educational , would have tags but more were expected soon .
when a tagged book is waved under the nabaztag 's nose it pulls a recording of a story being read from the net and begins to play it .
moving the rabbit 's ears lets listeners skip forward or back in the text .
the rabbit also remembers where it reached in the book so , in the case of a story , it can pick up at the right place in the action when listeners want to continue .
" in the average house you have about 10,000 different objects and right now you have maybe three objects connected to the net - phone , computer and perhaps a rabbit , " he said .
" but we think that more and more objects are going to be connected , " said mr kitten .
mr kitten said putting tags on books had huge potential .
for instance , he said , a tagged book could become a key to future content if a novel was made in to a film or game .
when the rabbit read the tag its owner would get the chance to watch the movie online or download a game .
" it 's a pedagogical way to explain what you can do with rfid and interactive objects , " he said .
violet also had plans to sell rfid stamps , or ztamps , that can be stuck on any object which can then be associated with almost any net content .
when they go on sale three ztamps will cost £ 1 -lrb- 1.34 euros -rrb- .

the rail maritime and transport union -lrb- rmt -rrb- and the transport salaried staffs association said workers faced an " unacceptable " attack on safety issues .
last year they complained about ticket office closures and staff shortages .
a transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- spokesman said the unions ' ballot warning was " completely unreasonable " .
workers last went on strike in september in a dispute linked to the collapse of maintenance firm metronet .
the move caused widespread travel chaos in london .
the rmt and the transport salaried staffs association -lrb- tssa -rrb- said the latest move came as station workers and drivers were at increased risk under plans to close 40 ticket offices and reduce opening hours . "
tube users should be as appalled as our members at the number of safety issues outstanding " gerry doherty of the tssa they also have concerns about staff working alone and the use of agency and security staff , and plans to introduce " mobile supervisors " at stations .
the rmt and tssa claim lu plans to use sub-contracting personnel to staff the tube station at heathrow 's terminal 5 , due to open in march .
the policies were put on hold by lu after protests but not withdrawn , the unions said .
rmt general secretary bob crow said : " each of these issues is serious in its own right , but together they amount to a fundamental and unacceptable attack on staffing across the network which strikes at the very heart of its safe operation . "
gerry doherty , general secretary of the tssa , said : " tube users should be as appalled as our members at the number of safety issues outstanding . "
a spokesman for tfl said : " all of the issues they claim are already being addressed in the normal way ...

reports seen by bbc radio 4 's file on 4 programme describe staff shortages , fatigue , overstretch and time pressure among workers and supervisors .
network rail -lrb- nr -rrb- chief executive iain coucher disputes official suggestions of systemic inspection failures .
rail regulators say nr has until 31 march 2008 to improve track inspection .
the unpublished report was by inspectors from her majesty 's rail inspectorate -lrb- hmri -rrb- , who visited 28 areas and maintenance depots from scotland to the south of england to investigate methods and systems of patrolling the tracks following the grayrigg crash in cumbria .
one woman died and 89 people were hurt when a virgin train was derailed in february 2007 .
we need to make sure that the patrolling ... allows network rail to identify defects before they become a safety risk office of rail regulation chairman chris bolt the railway inspectors , who are now part of the office of rail regulation -lrb- orr -rrb- , completed their report in november , but it has yet to be published .
the inspectors say overall track patrolling is carried out by competent and experienced staff and is given a high priority by all involved in the process .
however the investigators also highlighted the following problems : numerous track inspection concerns risk defects going undetected track maintenance gangs are continually being stretched further and further patrols have been missed or carried out by staff who do not know the tracks they are inspecting there is little evidence that patrollers ' performance is monitored by supervisors or managers orr chairman chris bolt told the bbc : " if the patrolling is n't being carried out properly , then network rail ca n't be sure that the track is as safe as they would want it to be .
" we need to make sure that the patrolling ... allows network rail to identify defects before they become a safety risk and to deal with them .
" we have not been satisfied as yet that their procedures are achieving that objective . "
further safety reports into derailments reveal concerns over how soon and how well network rail actually repairs known track defects .
the reports , by the department of transport 's rail accident investigation branch , followed three derailments , at waterloo station and at epsom in surrey in 2006 .
we are proud of the fact that the rail industry is the safest form of transport in the uk network rail chief executive iain coucher there were no casualties in those incidents , but a solicitor representing relatives of victims of the 2002 potters bar rail crash , which killed seven people , said the epsom case " appears to have the same features as potters bar and grayrigg " .
but nr chief executive iain coucher defends his network 's safety record .
" we are proud of the fact that the rail industry is the safest form of transport in the uk , " he told the bbc .
he stated that the mistakes made in the cumbria crash were localised , adding : " we do not accept there is a systemic failure in our inspection regimes . "
mr coucher said nr was working closely with the hmri to identify areas for improvement in its inspection regime .
he also said the problems at epsom and waterloo were localised .
" these people are under a lot of pressure to get the railway back and operating at waterloo station , and the epsom area is probably the most intensely used piece of railway in western europe , " mr coucher added .
he said nr had one of the most sophisticated systems of works management used by some of the world 's best railways .
