the german airline cancelled 70 flights amid concerns that the strikes could damage the economy . prolonged industrial action could hurt germany 's economy , which is already suffering from soaring energy prices , the global credit crunch and an overly strong euro , the government 's tourism chief ernst hinsken said on tuesday . " strikes such as those at lufthansa could pose a serious risk to the german economy , " he told the daily passauer neue presse . most flights still running service was cancelled to domestic and european destinations for the second day on tuesday , a spokesman said , but the grounded flights represented just three percent of those scheduled by the carrier .
long-haul flights were operating normally , he said . a walk-out by ground maintenance personnel forced the cancellations . about 5,000 maintenance , freight and catering staff stopped work on monday in frankfurt and hamburg but few flights were disrupted on the first day .
berlin was added on tuesday , with stuttgart to follow later in the evening , thus affecting all of lufthansa 's locations in the country . verdi wants a 9.8 percent pay hike over a year for around 50,000 workers , while lufthansa has offered 6.7 percent over 21 months and appealed for another round of negotiations . verdi has said it wo n't negotiate until lufthansa comes back with a higher offer . " we 're prepared to keep the strikes going for a long time , " said verdi spokesman helmut reutter . hurting lufthansa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all lufthansa employees are supporting the strike according to experts , prolonged strikes could cause heavy losses for the airlines , particularly due to a loss in business travelers , who tend to book spontaneously and choose higher-priced business or first class seats . tourists , on the other hand , " rebook and put up with delayed departures and arrivals , " said aviation expert cord schellenberg , according to dpa news agency .
" the most important thing is that they reach their destination . " verdi said it was doing what it could to avoid inconveniencing travelers while it ratcheted up the pressure on lufthansa . " the goal of the strike is not to hinder passengers but to increase the cost to the company , " verdi 's chief negotiator erhard ott said monday , noting that ordering catering from other firms or docking planes in other hangars was " very pricey . " as the largest aircraft maintenance service provider in germany , lufthansa would likely have a difficult time finding replacements on the ground , industry experts said . ott added that lufthansa had already seen a decline in reservations in recent weeks as wary passengers booked with other carriers . the newspaper die welt quoted verdi as saying the strike would cost lufthansa five million euros -lrb- $ 7.9 million -rrb- a day . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .
but paying for the privilege remains a sticking point to some . " as to whether or not people will be willing to pay such a large amount of money to watch something of unknown quality is very doubtful , " rohver said . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 'll be a worldwide first , he says . ulrich schroeder , 58 , is n't likely to be missed , even in a crowd , wearing his top hat and black " shine the light " tunic emblazoned with rolling stones badges and myriad emblems . a former savings-bank clerk , schroeder has been a fan and high-volume collector of rolling stones memorabilia for over 40 years , attending 160 of the british group 's concerts around the world . now he is to open what he says is " the world 's first museum devoted exclusively to the rolling stones " in his hometown of luechow , southeast of the german city of hamburg . he has acquired a former supermarket and converted the space to house more than 4,000 rolling stones items he has amassed over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder has over 4,000 pieces of stones memorabilia schroeder , who expects to invest 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- in the stones museum , said the luechow town council is also backing the project with a 100,000-euro subsidy . a draw for stones fans across europe luechow is just a small town with a population of barely 10,000 , but schroeder told dpa news agency that he is not worried on that score . " the museum is likely to attract fans not only from neighboring cities like hamburg , bremen and wolfsburg , but also from the whole of europe , " he said . the museum , due to open in 2010 , will have a 600-square-meter -lrb- 6,500 square-foot -rrb- exhibition area to display hundreds of the group 's t-shirts , posters , hand-signed instruments , photos , books , dvds , super-8 and 35-millimetre films , rare stones single and lp records , concert tickets and press cuttings related to the evergreen pop group . in addition , schroeder said he will be exhibiting his own extensive collection of paintings and other art work by rolling stones guitarist ron wood . banking or sex and rock ' n ' roll ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with mick jagger at the helm , the rolling stones continue to draw huge crowds " ron woods is a talented artist who has produced a lot of paintings , etchings , wood cuts and mono prints down the years , " said the german .
in london , wood has a company producing copies of his art . schroeder agreed in london in the early 1990s to become woods ' personal art vendor , and went on to exhibit and sell woods ' art outside britain , notably in the netherlands , italy , switzerland and germany . invited to attend wood 's 50th birthday party in ireland in the mid-1990s , schroeder recalled him jokingly saying : " do you want to continue earning your living in a savings bank , or with sex , rock ' n ' roll ? " schroeder said he retorted he would like to be the guitarist 's art guru .
recently one of wood 's paintings sold for $ 1 million . bad press for woods in a dpa phone interview , schroeder said that when he first contemplated creating a stones museum , several people in the entertainment business signalled interest , with one collector even offering him a seven-figure sum for his stones possessions . " but i 'd set my heart on creating the museum in luechow , out of loyalty to my hometown , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder served as wood 's personal art vendor asked about his long-standing friendship with wood and his family , schroeder said at first the link had more to do with art than music . " i found his paintings exciting and provocative , " he said . recently , wood made unwelcome headlines in tabloid newspapers , with reports of alcohol problems and a fling with a 19-year-old kazakhstani waitress .
schroeder would not discuss the reports . not in it for the money wrapped up in his museum plans , he says all other rock museums have a wider focus and he believes his will be the first " devoted exclusively to the rolling stones . " " i know the museum wo n't make me rich .
but then but that 's not the point of the exercise , " said the devoted stones fan . he is to register the name " rock & art museum luechow " as an exclusive trademark shortly , said schroeder .
films and concerts would also be staged in the museum and a " rock cafe " will serve food and drinks to visitors . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .
the ban also applies to siemens . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 29.07.2008 opinion : first step made toward clearing up siemens scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first defendant to be tried in the siemens corruption scandal has been sentenced .
but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved .

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back .

he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .

but the bloc is not going to rush to pursue trade talks with the balkan nation . at a meeting in brussels , representatives of eu member states agreed on tuesday , july , 29 , that while karadzic 's arrest on july 21 was a very important step for serbia 's new , pro-eu government to have taken , it was not enough in itself to warrant offering belgrade a political reward . demonstrations planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian police prepared for a massive rally on tuesday thousands of riot police have were sent to belgrade to prevent violence during a large pro- karadzic rally scheduled for tuesday night .
serbia 's president has warned the right-wing extremists to remain peaceful as they protest the arrest of a war crimes suspect they consider a hero . pro-western president boris tadic says " everyone has the right to demonstrate , but they should know that law and order will be respected . " hardliners , who regard karadzic as a hero and defender of serbia , put up posters with his image around the serbian capital and say they expect tens of thousands to demonstrate peacefully . " this rally will be a symbol of resistance , a symbol of the strength of those who love freedom more than anything , " said aleksandar vucic of the nationalist radical party , one of the strongest parties in serbia .
" we 'll continue resisting dictatorship in serbia , we 'll continue raising the question of whose paramilitary forces arrested radovan karadzic , how and why . " the eu is keen to forge closer ties with serbia , but it will not consider doing so until karadzic is transferred to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague , and until the icty 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , certifies that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization , diplomats said . the decision confirms a similar statement from eu foreign ministers , who met the day after karadzic 's arrest . transfer likely soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic is still in serbia awaiting extradition to the hague karadzic is currently under arrest in belgrade .
his lawyer is reportedly fighting his extradition by every means possible , including posting the appeal against extradition from a remote location in order to delay its delivery . however , officials expect karadzic to be transferred to the icty " very soon , " according to the dpa news agency . brammertz is to visit belgrade in august , an eu diplomat said . the eu has long said that all the states of the western balkans , including serbia , should join the bloc when they are ready to do so . but relations with serbia have been damaged by the support of most eu member states for the breakaway province of kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in february . twice this year , the eu has offered serbia deals on issues such as trade and travel just before national elections , in a bid to boost pro-eu forces in the country . observers say that that policy has been largely successful , as serbia now has a pro-eu president and government . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de former us envoy says karadzic would have been " good nazi " radovan karadzic would have made " a good nazi , " richard holbrooke , the us special envoy who brokered the 1995 deal that ended the bosnian war , has said , following the arrest of the bosnian serb leader in belgrade .
-lrb- 26.07.2008 -rrb- serbian pm pledges full cooperation with war crimes tribunal full cooperation with the hague war crimes tribunal is serbia 's responsibility and is directly connected with defending territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country , the serbian prime minister said on saturday .

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .

the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .

the german airline cancelled 70 flights amid concerns that the strikes could damage the economy . prolonged industrial action could hurt germany 's economy , which is already suffering from soaring energy prices , the global credit crunch and an overly strong euro , the government 's tourism chief ernst hinsken said on tuesday . " strikes such as those at lufthansa could pose a serious risk to the german economy , " he told the daily passauer neue presse . most flights still running service was cancelled to domestic and european destinations for the second day on tuesday , a spokesman said , but the grounded flights represented just three percent of those scheduled by the carrier .
long-haul flights were operating normally , he said . a walk-out by ground maintenance personnel forced the cancellations . about 5,000 maintenance , freight and catering staff stopped work on monday in frankfurt and hamburg but few flights were disrupted on the first day .
berlin was added on tuesday , with stuttgart to follow later in the evening , thus affecting all of lufthansa 's locations in the country . verdi wants a 9.8 percent pay hike over a year for around 50,000 workers , while lufthansa has offered 6.7 percent over 21 months and appealed for another round of negotiations . verdi has said it wo n't negotiate until lufthansa comes back with a higher offer . " we 're prepared to keep the strikes going for a long time , " said verdi spokesman helmut reutter . hurting lufthansa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all lufthansa employees are supporting the strike according to experts , prolonged strikes could cause heavy losses for the airlines , particularly due to a loss in business travelers , who tend to book spontaneously and choose higher-priced business or first class seats . tourists , on the other hand , " rebook and put up with delayed departures and arrivals , " said aviation expert cord schellenberg , according to dpa news agency .
" the most important thing is that they reach their destination . " verdi said it was doing what it could to avoid inconveniencing travelers while it ratcheted up the pressure on lufthansa . " the goal of the strike is not to hinder passengers but to increase the cost to the company , " verdi 's chief negotiator erhard ott said monday , noting that ordering catering from other firms or docking planes in other hangars was " very pricey . " as the largest aircraft maintenance service provider in germany , lufthansa would likely have a difficult time finding replacements on the ground , industry experts said . ott added that lufthansa had already seen a decline in reservations in recent weeks as wary passengers booked with other carriers . the newspaper die welt quoted verdi as saying the strike would cost lufthansa five million euros -lrb- $ 7.9 million -rrb- a day . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved . " go back to turkey ? " asked mostafa , a 32-year-old refugee from istanbul who 's since become a naturalized german .

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .
and all the statistics and assessments show that these areas are functioning better and better . creativity europe 's biggest asset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common currency is one example of how european nations are growing closer the everyday lives of european citizens have , for a fairly long time , been increasingly taking place in european dimensions , at the latest since the euro has become the currency in most eu member states . that may not necessarily be observable in daily life but it holds true in areas ranging from work and training , sport and leisure to science and research .
the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .
but without optimism , there would not be what europe has already achieved : for instance , half a century of peace on a continent with a history of continual war . gerd g. kopper -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .

it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .

it 'll be a worldwide first , he says . ulrich schroeder , 58 , is n't likely to be missed , even in a crowd , wearing his top hat and black " shine the light " tunic emblazoned with rolling stones badges and myriad emblems . a former savings-bank clerk , schroeder has been a fan and high-volume collector of rolling stones memorabilia for over 40 years , attending 160 of the british group 's concerts around the world . now he is to open what he says is " the world 's first museum devoted exclusively to the rolling stones " in his hometown of luechow , southeast of the german city of hamburg . he has acquired a former supermarket and converted the space to house more than 4,000 rolling stones items he has amassed over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder has over 4,000 pieces of stones memorabilia schroeder , who expects to invest 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- in the stones museum , said the luechow town council is also backing the project with a 100,000-euro subsidy . a draw for stones fans across europe luechow is just a small town with a population of barely 10,000 , but schroeder told dpa news agency that he is not worried on that score . " the museum is likely to attract fans not only from neighboring cities like hamburg , bremen and wolfsburg , but also from the whole of europe , " he said . the museum , due to open in 2010 , will have a 600-square-meter -lrb- 6,500 square-foot -rrb- exhibition area to display hundreds of the group 's t-shirts , posters , hand-signed instruments , photos , books , dvds , super-8 and 35-millimetre films , rare stones single and lp records , concert tickets and press cuttings related to the evergreen pop group . in addition , schroeder said he will be exhibiting his own extensive collection of paintings and other art work by rolling stones guitarist ron wood . banking or sex and rock ' n ' roll ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with mick jagger at the helm , the rolling stones continue to draw huge crowds " ron woods is a talented artist who has produced a lot of paintings , etchings , wood cuts and mono prints down the years , " said the german .
in london , wood has a company producing copies of his art . schroeder agreed in london in the early 1990s to become woods ' personal art vendor , and went on to exhibit and sell woods ' art outside britain , notably in the netherlands , italy , switzerland and germany . invited to attend wood 's 50th birthday party in ireland in the mid-1990s , schroeder recalled him jokingly saying : " do you want to continue earning your living in a savings bank , or with sex , rock ' n ' roll ? " schroeder said he retorted he would like to be the guitarist 's art guru .
recently one of wood 's paintings sold for $ 1 million . bad press for woods in a dpa phone interview , schroeder said that when he first contemplated creating a stones museum , several people in the entertainment business signalled interest , with one collector even offering him a seven-figure sum for his stones possessions . " but i 'd set my heart on creating the museum in luechow , out of loyalty to my hometown , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder served as wood 's personal art vendor asked about his long-standing friendship with wood and his family , schroeder said at first the link had more to do with art than music . " i found his paintings exciting and provocative , " he said . recently , wood made unwelcome headlines in tabloid newspapers , with reports of alcohol problems and a fling with a 19-year-old kazakhstani waitress .
schroeder would not discuss the reports . not in it for the money wrapped up in his museum plans , he says all other rock museums have a wider focus and he believes his will be the first " devoted exclusively to the rolling stones . " " i know the museum wo n't make me rich .
but then but that 's not the point of the exercise , " said the devoted stones fan . he is to register the name " rock & art museum luechow " as an exclusive trademark shortly , said schroeder .
films and concerts would also be staged in the museum and a " rock cafe " will serve food and drinks to visitors . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 'll be a worldwide first , he says . ulrich schroeder , 58 , is n't likely to be missed , even in a crowd , wearing his top hat and black " shine the light " tunic emblazoned with rolling stones badges and myriad emblems . a former savings-bank clerk , schroeder has been a fan and high-volume collector of rolling stones memorabilia for over 40 years , attending 160 of the british group 's concerts around the world . now he is to open what he says is " the world 's first museum devoted exclusively to the rolling stones " in his hometown of luechow , southeast of the german city of hamburg . he has acquired a former supermarket and converted the space to house more than 4,000 rolling stones items he has amassed over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder has over 4,000 pieces of stones memorabilia schroeder , who expects to invest 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- in the stones museum , said the luechow town council is also backing the project with a 100,000-euro subsidy . a draw for stones fans across europe luechow is just a small town with a population of barely 10,000 , but schroeder told dpa news agency that he is not worried on that score . " the museum is likely to attract fans not only from neighboring cities like hamburg , bremen and wolfsburg , but also from the whole of europe , " he said . the museum , due to open in 2010 , will have a 600-square-meter -lrb- 6,500 square-foot -rrb- exhibition area to display hundreds of the group 's t-shirts , posters , hand-signed instruments , photos , books , dvds , super-8 and 35-millimetre films , rare stones single and lp records , concert tickets and press cuttings related to the evergreen pop group . in addition , schroeder said he will be exhibiting his own extensive collection of paintings and other art work by rolling stones guitarist ron wood . banking or sex and rock ' n ' roll ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with mick jagger at the helm , the rolling stones continue to draw huge crowds " ron woods is a talented artist who has produced a lot of paintings , etchings , wood cuts and mono prints down the years , " said the german .
in london , wood has a company producing copies of his art . schroeder agreed in london in the early 1990s to become woods ' personal art vendor , and went on to exhibit and sell woods ' art outside britain , notably in the netherlands , italy , switzerland and germany . invited to attend wood 's 50th birthday party in ireland in the mid-1990s , schroeder recalled him jokingly saying : " do you want to continue earning your living in a savings bank , or with sex , rock ' n ' roll ? " schroeder said he retorted he would like to be the guitarist 's art guru .
recently one of wood 's paintings sold for $ 1 million . bad press for woods in a dpa phone interview , schroeder said that when he first contemplated creating a stones museum , several people in the entertainment business signalled interest , with one collector even offering him a seven-figure sum for his stones possessions . " but i 'd set my heart on creating the museum in luechow , out of loyalty to my hometown , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder served as wood 's personal art vendor asked about his long-standing friendship with wood and his family , schroeder said at first the link had more to do with art than music . " i found his paintings exciting and provocative , " he said . recently , wood made unwelcome headlines in tabloid newspapers , with reports of alcohol problems and a fling with a 19-year-old kazakhstani waitress .
schroeder would not discuss the reports . not in it for the money wrapped up in his museum plans , he says all other rock museums have a wider focus and he believes his will be the first " devoted exclusively to the rolling stones . " " i know the museum wo n't make me rich .
but then but that 's not the point of the exercise , " said the devoted stones fan . he is to register the name " rock & art museum luechow " as an exclusive trademark shortly , said schroeder .
films and concerts would also be staged in the museum and a " rock cafe " will serve food and drinks to visitors . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's much too intertwined with the top managers . " if the government is too hesitant , it should at least take the left party 's other suggestion and drastically raise taxes for incomes above 600,000 euros , " lafontaine added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking helped make porsche profitable porsche , however , was quick to point out that wiedeking 's estimated income was still mere speculation .

luxury sports car manufacturer porsche did well this past fiscal year , with profits exceeding turnover .
that meant a hefty bonus for ceo wendelin wiedeking , leading some to complain that german managers earn too much . porsche chief wiedeking could earn as much as 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- this year for his contribution to the carmaker 's success , a steep increase on the 60 million euros he earned last year . in response , the opposition left party once again said that the german government should cap top managers ' salaries . the grand coalition of christian and social democrats is " incapable of putting an end to managers ' brazen self-serving , " left party head oskar lafontaine told the berliner zeitung on tuesday , july 29 . " it 's much too intertwined with the top managers . " if the government is too hesitant , it should at least take the left party 's other suggestion and drastically raise taxes for incomes above 600,000 euros , " lafontaine added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking helped make porsche profitable porsche , however , was quick to point out that wiedeking 's estimated income was still mere speculation . " even lafontaine knows that managers ' salaries are fixed by the board of directors , " a porsche spokesman told der spiegel newsmagazine 's online edition . a case for the extra zeroes the german mass-circulation tabloid bild , however , argued in its tuesday edition that wiedeking has fairly earned every euro of his pay check . when wiedeking took charge of porsche in 1992 , the carmaker was nearly broke , wrote the paper , but the new ceo injected his private funds into the company to get it back on track .
his management strategy worked and over the next decade and a half porsche grew in value from 300 million to some 17 billion euros , making it the most profitable carmaker in the world . as a result , the porsche family reportedly rewarded wiedeking with a 1 percent share in company profits . the unusual accounting situation for this past fiscal year resulted from the revaluation of porsche 's 31-percent share in volkswagen , according to reports . the stuttgart-based carmaker would earn more than 11 billion euros on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros for the financial year ending on july 31 . porsche 's attempt to acquire control of volkswagen has been hindered by the state of lower saxony , where vw 's headquarters are located .
the state owns a 20.3-percent stake in the company but a special provision in a disputed german law allows it to block major decisions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .
the ban also applies to siemens . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .
the ban also applies to siemens . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .

even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran .

the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved .

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .
but paying for the privilege remains a sticking point to some . " as to whether or not people will be willing to pay such a large amount of money to watch something of unknown quality is very doubtful , " rohver said . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .
and all the statistics and assessments show that these areas are functioning better and better . creativity europe 's biggest asset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common currency is one example of how european nations are growing closer the everyday lives of european citizens have , for a fairly long time , been increasingly taking place in european dimensions , at the latest since the euro has become the currency in most eu member states . that may not necessarily be observable in daily life but it holds true in areas ranging from work and training , sport and leisure to science and research .
the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .
but without optimism , there would not be what europe has already achieved : for instance , half a century of peace on a continent with a history of continual war . gerd g. kopper -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .
and all the statistics and assessments show that these areas are functioning better and better . creativity europe 's biggest asset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common currency is one example of how european nations are growing closer the everyday lives of european citizens have , for a fairly long time , been increasingly taking place in european dimensions , at the latest since the euro has become the currency in most eu member states . that may not necessarily be observable in daily life but it holds true in areas ranging from work and training , sport and leisure to science and research .
the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .
but without optimism , there would not be what europe has already achieved : for instance , half a century of peace on a continent with a history of continual war . gerd g. kopper -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .
but paying for the privilege remains a sticking point to some . " as to whether or not people will be willing to pay such a large amount of money to watch something of unknown quality is very doubtful , " rohver said . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .

the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .

in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .

in london , wood has a company producing copies of his art . schroeder agreed in london in the early 1990s to become woods ' personal art vendor , and went on to exhibit and sell woods ' art outside britain , notably in the netherlands , italy , switzerland and germany . invited to attend wood 's 50th birthday party in ireland in the mid-1990s , schroeder recalled him jokingly saying : " do you want to continue earning your living in a savings bank , or with sex , rock ' n ' roll ? " schroeder said he retorted he would like to be the guitarist 's art guru .
recently one of wood 's paintings sold for $ 1 million . bad press for woods in a dpa phone interview , schroeder said that when he first contemplated creating a stones museum , several people in the entertainment business signalled interest , with one collector even offering him a seven-figure sum for his stones possessions . " but i 'd set my heart on creating the museum in luechow , out of loyalty to my hometown , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder served as wood 's personal art vendor asked about his long-standing friendship with wood and his family , schroeder said at first the link had more to do with art than music . " i found his paintings exciting and provocative , " he said . recently , wood made unwelcome headlines in tabloid newspapers , with reports of alcohol problems and a fling with a 19-year-old kazakhstani waitress .
schroeder would not discuss the reports . not in it for the money wrapped up in his museum plans , he says all other rock museums have a wider focus and he believes his will be the first " devoted exclusively to the rolling stones . " " i know the museum wo n't make me rich .
but then but that 's not the point of the exercise , " said the devoted stones fan . he is to register the name " rock & art museum luechow " as an exclusive trademark shortly , said schroeder .
films and concerts would also be staged in the museum and a " rock cafe " will serve food and drinks to visitors . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the bloc is not going to rush to pursue trade talks with the balkan nation . at a meeting in brussels , representatives of eu member states agreed on tuesday , july , 29 , that while karadzic 's arrest on july 21 was a very important step for serbia 's new , pro-eu government to have taken , it was not enough in itself to warrant offering belgrade a political reward . demonstrations planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian police prepared for a massive rally on tuesday thousands of riot police have were sent to belgrade to prevent violence during a large pro- karadzic rally scheduled for tuesday night .
serbia 's president has warned the right-wing extremists to remain peaceful as they protest the arrest of a war crimes suspect they consider a hero . pro-western president boris tadic says " everyone has the right to demonstrate , but they should know that law and order will be respected . " hardliners , who regard karadzic as a hero and defender of serbia , put up posters with his image around the serbian capital and say they expect tens of thousands to demonstrate peacefully . " this rally will be a symbol of resistance , a symbol of the strength of those who love freedom more than anything , " said aleksandar vucic of the nationalist radical party , one of the strongest parties in serbia .
" we 'll continue resisting dictatorship in serbia , we 'll continue raising the question of whose paramilitary forces arrested radovan karadzic , how and why . " the eu is keen to forge closer ties with serbia , but it will not consider doing so until karadzic is transferred to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague , and until the icty 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , certifies that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization , diplomats said . the decision confirms a similar statement from eu foreign ministers , who met the day after karadzic 's arrest . transfer likely soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic is still in serbia awaiting extradition to the hague karadzic is currently under arrest in belgrade .
his lawyer is reportedly fighting his extradition by every means possible , including posting the appeal against extradition from a remote location in order to delay its delivery . however , officials expect karadzic to be transferred to the icty " very soon , " according to the dpa news agency . brammertz is to visit belgrade in august , an eu diplomat said . the eu has long said that all the states of the western balkans , including serbia , should join the bloc when they are ready to do so . but relations with serbia have been damaged by the support of most eu member states for the breakaway province of kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in february . twice this year , the eu has offered serbia deals on issues such as trade and travel just before national elections , in a bid to boost pro-eu forces in the country . observers say that that policy has been largely successful , as serbia now has a pro-eu president and government . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no use beating around the bush , this meeting has collapsed , members have simply not been able to bridge their differences , " lamy told journalists .
he said the 153 members of the wto needed time to decide on how to proceed .
" we will need to let the dust settle a bit , it 's probably difficult to look too far into the future at this point , " he said .
" wto members will need to have a sober look at if and how they bring the pieces back together , " he added .
germany voices deep disappointment germany said it was bitterly disappointed at the collapse of the doha round , saying it would press for the talks to reopen .
" an agreement at the multilateral trade negotiations would have been an important boost at the right moment for the world economy , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary at the economics ministry in berlin .
he said the german government would work insistently on a resumption of the talks as soon as possible .
" we can not afford any lengthy idle period , " said pfaffenbach , saying that all wto members would benefit if markets were opened .
ludwig georg braun , president of the federation of german chambers of industry and commerce dihk , called the breakdown a " harsh setback " for business .
" a major opportunity has been wasted , especially considering that the world economy is clouding over , " he said .
eu fears job losses before the talks ended , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson appealed to delegations to hammer out a deal on the opening of agricultural markets , an issue many observers thought had been resolved last friday . " if people do n't want this deal , there 's no better deal coming along and we just have to consider , if this fails , what they will lose , " he said earlier on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers say the pact 's failure could force them to cut jobs in the eu european automakers and trade unions said the talks ' failure could put european industrial jobs at risk . " the result could be major job losses in the european union , at the level of the manufacturers , but also in the supply chain , " peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation said in a statement . usa vs. china , india the agriculture row escalated when india and china refused to further open their agriculture markets , not wanting to entirely weaken the applicable mechanisms protecting their farmers .
delegates said negotiations stumbled on proposals for so-called ssm measures to protect poor farmers that would have imposed a special tariff on certain agricultural goods in the event of an import surge or price fall .
the two countries , saying they are speaking for some 100 developing countries , argued for a customs arrangement to protect farmers in poor countries against excessively high food imports . the differences have pitted the united states on one side and india and china on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab said the usa was still committed to the doha round of talks us trade representative susan schwab accused the two countries of undermining the hard-fought compromise package , saying the united states had made great concessions especially in regard to the removal of its cotton subsidies . " we were so close to getting this done , " schwab told reporters at wto headquarters after countries failed to compromise over measure to protect farmers in poor countries . time for a change of focus ? some wto representatives sympathized with the two developing countries , saying that in light of the still enormous numbers of poor that china and india have to care for , agricultural and food security in these countries had to be strengthened , not weakened by cheap imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues are currently less heated than agriculture disputes a large portion of poorer developing countries supported the indian-chinese position . with a new president taking office in the united states , changes in the european commission , and a possible election in india all occurring next year , the future of the doha round trade talks could be in jeopardy as leaders set new trade priorities , according to experts cited by the reuters news agency . " this fourth collapse after cancun , hong kong and potsdam suggests that the wto members may need to rethink the agenda rather than try again with the same program , " edward gresser , of the progressive policy institute in washington , told reuters . " in particular , they might move agricultural reform out of the center for a few years , and focus instead on big newly emerging industries … where attitudes are less entrenched and emotional .

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved . " go back to turkey ? " asked mostafa , a 32-year-old refugee from istanbul who 's since become a naturalized german .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 29.07.2008 eu puts off serbia trade decision despite karadzic arrest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic supporters are expected to demonstrate against his extradiction tuesday the european union said it will keep a close eye on developments in serbia following the arrest of war crimes suspect radovan karadzic .
but the bloc is not going to rush to pursue trade talks with the balkan nation . at a meeting in brussels , representatives of eu member states agreed on tuesday , july , 29 , that while karadzic 's arrest on july 21 was a very important step for serbia 's new , pro-eu government to have taken , it was not enough in itself to warrant offering belgrade a political reward . demonstrations planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian police prepared for a massive rally on tuesday thousands of riot police have were sent to belgrade to prevent violence during a large pro- karadzic rally scheduled for tuesday night .
serbia 's president has warned the right-wing extremists to remain peaceful as they protest the arrest of a war crimes suspect they consider a hero . pro-western president boris tadic says " everyone has the right to demonstrate , but they should know that law and order will be respected . " hardliners , who regard karadzic as a hero and defender of serbia , put up posters with his image around the serbian capital and say they expect tens of thousands to demonstrate peacefully . " this rally will be a symbol of resistance , a symbol of the strength of those who love freedom more than anything , " said aleksandar vucic of the nationalist radical party , one of the strongest parties in serbia .
" we 'll continue resisting dictatorship in serbia , we 'll continue raising the question of whose paramilitary forces arrested radovan karadzic , how and why . " the eu is keen to forge closer ties with serbia , but it will not consider doing so until karadzic is transferred to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague , and until the icty 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , certifies that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization , diplomats said . the decision confirms a similar statement from eu foreign ministers , who met the day after karadzic 's arrest . transfer likely soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic is still in serbia awaiting extradition to the hague karadzic is currently under arrest in belgrade .
his lawyer is reportedly fighting his extradition by every means possible , including posting the appeal against extradition from a remote location in order to delay its delivery . however , officials expect karadzic to be transferred to the icty " very soon , " according to the dpa news agency . brammertz is to visit belgrade in august , an eu diplomat said . the eu has long said that all the states of the western balkans , including serbia , should join the bloc when they are ready to do so . but relations with serbia have been damaged by the support of most eu member states for the breakaway province of kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in february . twice this year , the eu has offered serbia deals on issues such as trade and travel just before national elections , in a bid to boost pro-eu forces in the country . observers say that that policy has been largely successful , as serbia now has a pro-eu president and government . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de former us envoy says karadzic would have been " good nazi " radovan karadzic would have made " a good nazi , " richard holbrooke , the us special envoy who brokered the 1995 deal that ended the bosnian war , has said , following the arrest of the bosnian serb leader in belgrade .
-lrb- 26.07.2008 -rrb- serbian pm pledges full cooperation with war crimes tribunal full cooperation with the hague war crimes tribunal is serbia 's responsibility and is directly connected with defending territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country , the serbian prime minister said on saturday .

it 'll be a worldwide first , he says . ulrich schroeder , 58 , is n't likely to be missed , even in a crowd , wearing his top hat and black " shine the light " tunic emblazoned with rolling stones badges and myriad emblems . a former savings-bank clerk , schroeder has been a fan and high-volume collector of rolling stones memorabilia for over 40 years , attending 160 of the british group 's concerts around the world . now he is to open what he says is " the world 's first museum devoted exclusively to the rolling stones " in his hometown of luechow , southeast of the german city of hamburg . he has acquired a former supermarket and converted the space to house more than 4,000 rolling stones items he has amassed over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder has over 4,000 pieces of stones memorabilia schroeder , who expects to invest 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- in the stones museum , said the luechow town council is also backing the project with a 100,000-euro subsidy . a draw for stones fans across europe luechow is just a small town with a population of barely 10,000 , but schroeder told dpa news agency that he is not worried on that score . " the museum is likely to attract fans not only from neighboring cities like hamburg , bremen and wolfsburg , but also from the whole of europe , " he said . the museum , due to open in 2010 , will have a 600-square-meter -lrb- 6,500 square-foot -rrb- exhibition area to display hundreds of the group 's t-shirts , posters , hand-signed instruments , photos , books , dvds , super-8 and 35-millimetre films , rare stones single and lp records , concert tickets and press cuttings related to the evergreen pop group . in addition , schroeder said he will be exhibiting his own extensive collection of paintings and other art work by rolling stones guitarist ron wood . banking or sex and rock ' n ' roll ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with mick jagger at the helm , the rolling stones continue to draw huge crowds " ron woods is a talented artist who has produced a lot of paintings , etchings , wood cuts and mono prints down the years , " said the german .
in london , wood has a company producing copies of his art . schroeder agreed in london in the early 1990s to become woods ' personal art vendor , and went on to exhibit and sell woods ' art outside britain , notably in the netherlands , italy , switzerland and germany . invited to attend wood 's 50th birthday party in ireland in the mid-1990s , schroeder recalled him jokingly saying : " do you want to continue earning your living in a savings bank , or with sex , rock ' n ' roll ? " schroeder said he retorted he would like to be the guitarist 's art guru .
recently one of wood 's paintings sold for $ 1 million . bad press for woods in a dpa phone interview , schroeder said that when he first contemplated creating a stones museum , several people in the entertainment business signalled interest , with one collector even offering him a seven-figure sum for his stones possessions . " but i 'd set my heart on creating the museum in luechow , out of loyalty to my hometown , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder served as wood 's personal art vendor asked about his long-standing friendship with wood and his family , schroeder said at first the link had more to do with art than music .

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .
and all the statistics and assessments show that these areas are functioning better and better . creativity europe 's biggest asset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common currency is one example of how european nations are growing closer the everyday lives of european citizens have , for a fairly long time , been increasingly taking place in european dimensions , at the latest since the euro has become the currency in most eu member states . that may not necessarily be observable in daily life but it holds true in areas ranging from work and training , sport and leisure to science and research .
the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .
but without optimism , there would not be what europe has already achieved : for instance , half a century of peace on a continent with a history of continual war . gerd g. kopper -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back .

it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .
he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .

luxury sports car manufacturer porsche did well this past fiscal year , with profits exceeding turnover .
that meant a hefty bonus for ceo wendelin wiedeking , leading some to complain that german managers earn too much . porsche chief wiedeking could earn as much as 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- this year for his contribution to the carmaker 's success , a steep increase on the 60 million euros he earned last year . in response , the opposition left party once again said that the german government should cap top managers ' salaries . the grand coalition of christian and social democrats is " incapable of putting an end to managers ' brazen self-serving , " left party head oskar lafontaine told the berliner zeitung on tuesday , july 29 . " it 's much too intertwined with the top managers . " if the government is too hesitant , it should at least take the left party 's other suggestion and drastically raise taxes for incomes above 600,000 euros , " lafontaine added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking helped make porsche profitable porsche , however , was quick to point out that wiedeking 's estimated income was still mere speculation . " even lafontaine knows that managers ' salaries are fixed by the board of directors , " a porsche spokesman told der spiegel newsmagazine 's online edition . a case for the extra zeroes the german mass-circulation tabloid bild , however , argued in its tuesday edition that wiedeking has fairly earned every euro of his pay check . when wiedeking took charge of porsche in 1992 , the carmaker was nearly broke , wrote the paper , but the new ceo injected his private funds into the company to get it back on track .
his management strategy worked and over the next decade and a half porsche grew in value from 300 million to some 17 billion euros , making it the most profitable carmaker in the world . as a result , the porsche family reportedly rewarded wiedeking with a 1 percent share in company profits . the unusual accounting situation for this past fiscal year resulted from the revaluation of porsche 's 31-percent share in volkswagen , according to reports . the stuttgart-based carmaker would earn more than 11 billion euros on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros for the financial year ending on july 31 . porsche 's attempt to acquire control of volkswagen has been hindered by the state of lower saxony , where vw 's headquarters are located .
the state owns a 20.3-percent stake in the company but a special provision in a disputed german law allows it to block major decisions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the bloc is not going to rush to pursue trade talks with the balkan nation . at a meeting in brussels , representatives of eu member states agreed on tuesday , july , 29 , that while karadzic 's arrest on july 21 was a very important step for serbia 's new , pro-eu government to have taken , it was not enough in itself to warrant offering belgrade a political reward . demonstrations planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian police prepared for a massive rally on tuesday thousands of riot police have were sent to belgrade to prevent violence during a large pro- karadzic rally scheduled for tuesday night .
serbia 's president has warned the right-wing extremists to remain peaceful as they protest the arrest of a war crimes suspect they consider a hero . pro-western president boris tadic says " everyone has the right to demonstrate , but they should know that law and order will be respected . " hardliners , who regard karadzic as a hero and defender of serbia , put up posters with his image around the serbian capital and say they expect tens of thousands to demonstrate peacefully . " this rally will be a symbol of resistance , a symbol of the strength of those who love freedom more than anything , " said aleksandar vucic of the nationalist radical party , one of the strongest parties in serbia .
" we 'll continue resisting dictatorship in serbia , we 'll continue raising the question of whose paramilitary forces arrested radovan karadzic , how and why . " the eu is keen to forge closer ties with serbia , but it will not consider doing so until karadzic is transferred to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague , and until the icty 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , certifies that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization , diplomats said . the decision confirms a similar statement from eu foreign ministers , who met the day after karadzic 's arrest . transfer likely soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic is still in serbia awaiting extradition to the hague karadzic is currently under arrest in belgrade .
his lawyer is reportedly fighting his extradition by every means possible , including posting the appeal against extradition from a remote location in order to delay its delivery . however , officials expect karadzic to be transferred to the icty " very soon , " according to the dpa news agency . brammertz is to visit belgrade in august , an eu diplomat said . the eu has long said that all the states of the western balkans , including serbia , should join the bloc when they are ready to do so . but relations with serbia have been damaged by the support of most eu member states for the breakaway province of kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in february . twice this year , the eu has offered serbia deals on issues such as trade and travel just before national elections , in a bid to boost pro-eu forces in the country . observers say that that policy has been largely successful , as serbia now has a pro-eu president and government . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de former us envoy says karadzic would have been " good nazi " radovan karadzic would have made " a good nazi , " richard holbrooke , the us special envoy who brokered the 1995 deal that ended the bosnian war , has said , following the arrest of the bosnian serb leader in belgrade .

but the bloc is not going to rush to pursue trade talks with the balkan nation . at a meeting in brussels , representatives of eu member states agreed on tuesday , july , 29 , that while karadzic 's arrest on july 21 was a very important step for serbia 's new , pro-eu government to have taken , it was not enough in itself to warrant offering belgrade a political reward . demonstrations planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian police prepared for a massive rally on tuesday thousands of riot police have were sent to belgrade to prevent violence during a large pro- karadzic rally scheduled for tuesday night .
serbia 's president has warned the right-wing extremists to remain peaceful as they protest the arrest of a war crimes suspect they consider a hero . pro-western president boris tadic says " everyone has the right to demonstrate , but they should know that law and order will be respected . " hardliners , who regard karadzic as a hero and defender of serbia , put up posters with his image around the serbian capital and say they expect tens of thousands to demonstrate peacefully . " this rally will be a symbol of resistance , a symbol of the strength of those who love freedom more than anything , " said aleksandar vucic of the nationalist radical party , one of the strongest parties in serbia .
" we 'll continue resisting dictatorship in serbia , we 'll continue raising the question of whose paramilitary forces arrested radovan karadzic , how and why . " the eu is keen to forge closer ties with serbia , but it will not consider doing so until karadzic is transferred to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague , and until the icty 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , certifies that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization , diplomats said . the decision confirms a similar statement from eu foreign ministers , who met the day after karadzic 's arrest . transfer likely soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic is still in serbia awaiting extradition to the hague karadzic is currently under arrest in belgrade .
his lawyer is reportedly fighting his extradition by every means possible , including posting the appeal against extradition from a remote location in order to delay its delivery . however , officials expect karadzic to be transferred to the icty " very soon , " according to the dpa news agency . brammertz is to visit belgrade in august , an eu diplomat said . the eu has long said that all the states of the western balkans , including serbia , should join the bloc when they are ready to do so . but relations with serbia have been damaged by the support of most eu member states for the breakaway province of kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in february . twice this year , the eu has offered serbia deals on issues such as trade and travel just before national elections , in a bid to boost pro-eu forces in the country . observers say that that policy has been largely successful , as serbia now has a pro-eu president and government . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 29.07.2008 opinion : first step made toward clearing up siemens scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first defendant to be tried in the siemens corruption scandal has been sentenced .
but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .

the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .

" of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .

the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .

even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .

luxury sports car manufacturer porsche did well this past fiscal year , with profits exceeding turnover .
that meant a hefty bonus for ceo wendelin wiedeking , leading some to complain that german managers earn too much . porsche chief wiedeking could earn as much as 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- this year for his contribution to the carmaker 's success , a steep increase on the 60 million euros he earned last year . in response , the opposition left party once again said that the german government should cap top managers ' salaries . the grand coalition of christian and social democrats is " incapable of putting an end to managers ' brazen self-serving , " left party head oskar lafontaine told the berliner zeitung on tuesday , july 29 . " it 's much too intertwined with the top managers . " if the government is too hesitant , it should at least take the left party 's other suggestion and drastically raise taxes for incomes above 600,000 euros , " lafontaine added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking helped make porsche profitable porsche , however , was quick to point out that wiedeking 's estimated income was still mere speculation . " even lafontaine knows that managers ' salaries are fixed by the board of directors , " a porsche spokesman told der spiegel newsmagazine 's online edition . a case for the extra zeroes the german mass-circulation tabloid bild , however , argued in its tuesday edition that wiedeking has fairly earned every euro of his pay check . when wiedeking took charge of porsche in 1992 , the carmaker was nearly broke , wrote the paper , but the new ceo injected his private funds into the company to get it back on track .
his management strategy worked and over the next decade and a half porsche grew in value from 300 million to some 17 billion euros , making it the most profitable carmaker in the world . as a result , the porsche family reportedly rewarded wiedeking with a 1 percent share in company profits . the unusual accounting situation for this past fiscal year resulted from the revaluation of porsche 's 31-percent share in volkswagen , according to reports . the stuttgart-based carmaker would earn more than 11 billion euros on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros for the financial year ending on july 31 . porsche 's attempt to acquire control of volkswagen has been hindered by the state of lower saxony , where vw 's headquarters are located .

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .

the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .
but paying for the privilege remains a sticking point to some . " as to whether or not people will be willing to pay such a large amount of money to watch something of unknown quality is very doubtful , " rohver said . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back . " fischer added that the bloc needed to take a " flexible approach " to cooperation between states on key issues in order to move forward after the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty , which foresees creating a new post to steer european foreign and security policy . fischer swayed green pacifists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in the greens supported fischer 's call for military action in kosovo a former leader of the german greens party , fischer was instrumental in convincing his fellow party members to turn away from the party 's pacifist roots and to support nato efforts in the balkans in the late 1990s .
it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .
he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .
" it is down to heads of government to demand progress - and to do more to explain to their publics and parliaments how vital this is for the security of every european .

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved . " go back to turkey ? " asked mostafa , a 32-year-old refugee from istanbul who 's since become a naturalized german .

wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .
but paying for the privilege remains a sticking point to some . " as to whether or not people will be willing to pay such a large amount of money to watch something of unknown quality is very doubtful , " rohver said . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .
the ban also applies to siemens . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .
and all the statistics and assessments show that these areas are functioning better and better . creativity europe 's biggest asset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common currency is one example of how european nations are growing closer the everyday lives of european citizens have , for a fairly long time , been increasingly taking place in european dimensions , at the latest since the euro has become the currency in most eu member states . that may not necessarily be observable in daily life but it holds true in areas ranging from work and training , sport and leisure to science and research .
the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .
but without optimism , there would not be what europe has already achieved : for instance , half a century of peace on a continent with a history of continual war . gerd g. kopper -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the bloc is not going to rush to pursue trade talks with the balkan nation . at a meeting in brussels , representatives of eu member states agreed on tuesday , july , 29 , that while karadzic 's arrest on july 21 was a very important step for serbia 's new , pro-eu government to have taken , it was not enough in itself to warrant offering belgrade a political reward . demonstrations planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian police prepared for a massive rally on tuesday thousands of riot police have were sent to belgrade to prevent violence during a large pro- karadzic rally scheduled for tuesday night .
serbia 's president has warned the right-wing extremists to remain peaceful as they protest the arrest of a war crimes suspect they consider a hero . pro-western president boris tadic says " everyone has the right to demonstrate , but they should know that law and order will be respected . " hardliners , who regard karadzic as a hero and defender of serbia , put up posters with his image around the serbian capital and say they expect tens of thousands to demonstrate peacefully . " this rally will be a symbol of resistance , a symbol of the strength of those who love freedom more than anything , " said aleksandar vucic of the nationalist radical party , one of the strongest parties in serbia .
" we 'll continue resisting dictatorship in serbia , we 'll continue raising the question of whose paramilitary forces arrested radovan karadzic , how and why . " the eu is keen to forge closer ties with serbia , but it will not consider doing so until karadzic is transferred to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague , and until the icty 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , certifies that belgrade is fully cooperating with his organization , diplomats said . the decision confirms a similar statement from eu foreign ministers , who met the day after karadzic 's arrest . transfer likely soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic is still in serbia awaiting extradition to the hague karadzic is currently under arrest in belgrade .
his lawyer is reportedly fighting his extradition by every means possible , including posting the appeal against extradition from a remote location in order to delay its delivery . however , officials expect karadzic to be transferred to the icty " very soon , " according to the dpa news agency . brammertz is to visit belgrade in august , an eu diplomat said . the eu has long said that all the states of the western balkans , including serbia , should join the bloc when they are ready to do so . but relations with serbia have been damaged by the support of most eu member states for the breakaway province of kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in february . twice this year , the eu has offered serbia deals on issues such as trade and travel just before national elections , in a bid to boost pro-eu forces in the country . observers say that that policy has been largely successful , as serbia now has a pro-eu president and government . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

luxury sports car manufacturer porsche did well this past fiscal year , with profits exceeding turnover .
that meant a hefty bonus for ceo wendelin wiedeking , leading some to complain that german managers earn too much . porsche chief wiedeking could earn as much as 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- this year for his contribution to the carmaker 's success , a steep increase on the 60 million euros he earned last year . in response , the opposition left party once again said that the german government should cap top managers ' salaries . the grand coalition of christian and social democrats is " incapable of putting an end to managers ' brazen self-serving , " left party head oskar lafontaine told the berliner zeitung on tuesday , july 29 . " it 's much too intertwined with the top managers . " if the government is too hesitant , it should at least take the left party 's other suggestion and drastically raise taxes for incomes above 600,000 euros , " lafontaine added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking helped make porsche profitable porsche , however , was quick to point out that wiedeking 's estimated income was still mere speculation . " even lafontaine knows that managers ' salaries are fixed by the board of directors , " a porsche spokesman told der spiegel newsmagazine 's online edition . a case for the extra zeroes the german mass-circulation tabloid bild , however , argued in its tuesday edition that wiedeking has fairly earned every euro of his pay check . when wiedeking took charge of porsche in 1992 , the carmaker was nearly broke , wrote the paper , but the new ceo injected his private funds into the company to get it back on track .
his management strategy worked and over the next decade and a half porsche grew in value from 300 million to some 17 billion euros , making it the most profitable carmaker in the world . as a result , the porsche family reportedly rewarded wiedeking with a 1 percent share in company profits . the unusual accounting situation for this past fiscal year resulted from the revaluation of porsche 's 31-percent share in volkswagen , according to reports . the stuttgart-based carmaker would earn more than 11 billion euros on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros for the financial year ending on july 31 . porsche 's attempt to acquire control of volkswagen has been hindered by the state of lower saxony , where vw 's headquarters are located .
the state owns a 20.3-percent stake in the company but a special provision in a disputed german law allows it to block major decisions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no use beating around the bush , this meeting has collapsed , members have simply not been able to bridge their differences , " lamy told journalists .
he said the 153 members of the wto needed time to decide on how to proceed .
" we will need to let the dust settle a bit , it 's probably difficult to look too far into the future at this point , " he said .
" wto members will need to have a sober look at if and how they bring the pieces back together , " he added .
germany voices deep disappointment germany said it was bitterly disappointed at the collapse of the doha round , saying it would press for the talks to reopen .
" an agreement at the multilateral trade negotiations would have been an important boost at the right moment for the world economy , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary at the economics ministry in berlin .
he said the german government would work insistently on a resumption of the talks as soon as possible .
" we can not afford any lengthy idle period , " said pfaffenbach , saying that all wto members would benefit if markets were opened .
ludwig georg braun , president of the federation of german chambers of industry and commerce dihk , called the breakdown a " harsh setback " for business .
" a major opportunity has been wasted , especially considering that the world economy is clouding over , " he said .
eu fears job losses before the talks ended , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson appealed to delegations to hammer out a deal on the opening of agricultural markets , an issue many observers thought had been resolved last friday . " if people do n't want this deal , there 's no better deal coming along and we just have to consider , if this fails , what they will lose , " he said earlier on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers say the pact 's failure could force them to cut jobs in the eu european automakers and trade unions said the talks ' failure could put european industrial jobs at risk . " the result could be major job losses in the european union , at the level of the manufacturers , but also in the supply chain , " peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation said in a statement . usa vs. china , india the agriculture row escalated when india and china refused to further open their agriculture markets , not wanting to entirely weaken the applicable mechanisms protecting their farmers .
delegates said negotiations stumbled on proposals for so-called ssm measures to protect poor farmers that would have imposed a special tariff on certain agricultural goods in the event of an import surge or price fall .
the two countries , saying they are speaking for some 100 developing countries , argued for a customs arrangement to protect farmers in poor countries against excessively high food imports . the differences have pitted the united states on one side and india and china on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab said the usa was still committed to the doha round of talks us trade representative susan schwab accused the two countries of undermining the hard-fought compromise package , saying the united states had made great concessions especially in regard to the removal of its cotton subsidies . " we were so close to getting this done , " schwab told reporters at wto headquarters after countries failed to compromise over measure to protect farmers in poor countries . time for a change of focus ? some wto representatives sympathized with the two developing countries , saying that in light of the still enormous numbers of poor that china and india have to care for , agricultural and food security in these countries had to be strengthened , not weakened by cheap imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues are currently less heated than agriculture disputes a large portion of poorer developing countries supported the indian-chinese position . with a new president taking office in the united states , changes in the european commission , and a possible election in india all occurring next year , the future of the doha round trade talks could be in jeopardy as leaders set new trade priorities , according to experts cited by the reuters news agency . " this fourth collapse after cancun , hong kong and potsdam suggests that the wto members may need to rethink the agenda rather than try again with the same program , " edward gresser , of the progressive policy institute in washington , told reuters . " in particular , they might move agricultural reform out of the center for a few years , and focus instead on big newly emerging industries … where attitudes are less entrenched and emotional .

2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .
but paying for the privilege remains a sticking point to some . " as to whether or not people will be willing to pay such a large amount of money to watch something of unknown quality is very doubtful , " rohver said . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .
and all the statistics and assessments show that these areas are functioning better and better . creativity europe 's biggest asset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common currency is one example of how european nations are growing closer the everyday lives of european citizens have , for a fairly long time , been increasingly taking place in european dimensions , at the latest since the euro has become the currency in most eu member states . that may not necessarily be observable in daily life but it holds true in areas ranging from work and training , sport and leisure to science and research .
the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .
but without optimism , there would not be what europe has already achieved : for instance , half a century of peace on a continent with a history of continual war . gerd g. kopper -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .

the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .

it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .

without new ideas and their effective communication nothing will change , says german journalism professor gerd kopper in an exclusive essay for dw-world.de. professor gerd g. kopper is a retired professor of journalism at the university of dortmund in germany .
he initiated the erich-brost institute for journalism in europe and was its director from 1999 to 2006 . there 's no dearth of criticism about " europe " in today 's media landscape .
unfortunately , a huge amount of it is nothing more than regurgitated gobbledygook .
many media studies have shown that detailed research of european policies and a balanced criticism of it are the exceptions to the rule . this image of " europe " painted by the media - often a mixture of sarcasm about apparent bureaucracy , exaggerated accusations and hidden nationalism in many countries - is a dominant one . but there is another more tangible and practical europe that works perfectly but about which hardly anything is reflected on or reported : trade , financial ties , tourism and scientific exchange work well in europe .
and all the statistics and assessments show that these areas are functioning better and better . creativity europe 's biggest asset bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common currency is one example of how european nations are growing closer the everyday lives of european citizens have , for a fairly long time , been increasingly taking place in european dimensions , at the latest since the euro has become the currency in most eu member states . that may not necessarily be observable in daily life but it holds true in areas ranging from work and training , sport and leisure to science and research .
the most impressive thing is to notice it when you visit a european capital .
you can hear and see how a melting of european borders has led to a new dynamism , to increased exchange and to new creative horizons . this kind of " europe-ization " has to go on and must have an impact in other important areas too , particularly in decisive sectors such as health , environment and the working world .
in the process , you ca n't afford to lose sight of the fact that europe 's most important raw materials are creativity , intelligence geared towards the future , innovation and the ability to be inventive . european initiatives have the possibility of breaking stagnation in many areas and in all member states .
but europe needs to become much stronger and more assertive . beware of the island mentality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european nations ca n't afford to go it alone the biggest danger for europe is to develop a kind of political and intellectual island mentality and to withdraw into an island existence or use this kind of thinking for cheap political wins in individual member states . thus the biggest challenge for europe is to develop a tolerant , open , understandable and angst-free realism . that includes strong decisions that make effective military alliances such as nato and make its relation to the supra-nationality of the european union effective .
it also includes ground breaking decisions on the status , role and practicality of european agriculture in the face of the current food and climate situation .
a new realism also includes new and long-term shared goals with africa and new forms of mutual commitments .
that also closely involves europe 's relationship to asia and china . in short , what 's needed in the coming two decades is the exact opposite of an island mentality and politics .
europe 's strategy is in no way clear enough - not to mention really convincing .
the future " europe " project ca n't be drawn up at the desk or sealed conference rooms alone .
without gripping new ideas and their effective communication , europe will lack motivation and enthusiasm . at least there 's optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's history gives europeans reason to be positive , kopper said at its heart , european policy will always remain abstract and complex . for journalists and editors , european policies are too focused on national reporting patterns and ways of working .
and that can get worse .
in general , european policies are too focused on clout and the view of individual interest groups and are often at the mercy of their organizational power .
that 's why new ideas and ways of working are needed everywhere . the lisbon treaty would finally have given a chance to say together : these are our next realistic common goals that we can achieve .
everybody was supposed to bond over it . instead , this simple task has now become one of the most difficult in europe .
but without optimism , there would not be what europe has already achieved : for instance , half a century of peace on a continent with a history of continual war . gerd g. kopper -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .

the german airline cancelled 70 flights amid concerns that the strikes could damage the economy . prolonged industrial action could hurt germany 's economy , which is already suffering from soaring energy prices , the global credit crunch and an overly strong euro , the government 's tourism chief ernst hinsken said on tuesday . " strikes such as those at lufthansa could pose a serious risk to the german economy , " he told the daily passauer neue presse . most flights still running service was cancelled to domestic and european destinations for the second day on tuesday , a spokesman said , but the grounded flights represented just three percent of those scheduled by the carrier .
long-haul flights were operating normally , he said . a walk-out by ground maintenance personnel forced the cancellations . about 5,000 maintenance , freight and catering staff stopped work on monday in frankfurt and hamburg but few flights were disrupted on the first day .
berlin was added on tuesday , with stuttgart to follow later in the evening , thus affecting all of lufthansa 's locations in the country . verdi wants a 9.8 percent pay hike over a year for around 50,000 workers , while lufthansa has offered 6.7 percent over 21 months and appealed for another round of negotiations . verdi has said it wo n't negotiate until lufthansa comes back with a higher offer . " we 're prepared to keep the strikes going for a long time , " said verdi spokesman helmut reutter . hurting lufthansa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all lufthansa employees are supporting the strike according to experts , prolonged strikes could cause heavy losses for the airlines , particularly due to a loss in business travelers , who tend to book spontaneously and choose higher-priced business or first class seats . tourists , on the other hand , " rebook and put up with delayed departures and arrivals , " said aviation expert cord schellenberg , according to dpa news agency .
" the most important thing is that they reach their destination . " verdi said it was doing what it could to avoid inconveniencing travelers while it ratcheted up the pressure on lufthansa . " the goal of the strike is not to hinder passengers but to increase the cost to the company , " verdi 's chief negotiator erhard ott said monday , noting that ordering catering from other firms or docking planes in other hangars was " very pricey . " as the largest aircraft maintenance service provider in germany , lufthansa would likely have a difficult time finding replacements on the ground , industry experts said . ott added that lufthansa had already seen a decline in reservations in recent weeks as wary passengers booked with other carriers . the newspaper die welt quoted verdi as saying the strike would cost lufthansa five million euros -lrb- $ 7.9 million -rrb- a day . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 29.07.2008 germany calls global trade talk breakdown a " missed chance " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failure has scuppered a deal between banana exporters in latin america and the eu germany has reacted with disappointment at the collapse of global trade talks in geneva , saying a new deal would have sent an important signal to the world economy at a time when it 's beset with problems . after nine days of haggling and discussions , some 40 ministers were unable to reach a compromise agreement on lowering global trade barriers and opening up agricultural markets . world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- chief pascal lamy said talks had collapsed because key powers were unable to bridge their differences on food tariffs . " there is no use beating around the bush , this meeting has collapsed , members have simply not been able to bridge their differences , " lamy told journalists .
he said the 153 members of the wto needed time to decide on how to proceed .
" we will need to let the dust settle a bit , it 's probably difficult to look too far into the future at this point , " he said .
" wto members will need to have a sober look at if and how they bring the pieces back together , " he added .
germany voices deep disappointment germany said it was bitterly disappointed at the collapse of the doha round , saying it would press for the talks to reopen .
" an agreement at the multilateral trade negotiations would have been an important boost at the right moment for the world economy , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary at the economics ministry in berlin .
he said the german government would work insistently on a resumption of the talks as soon as possible .
" we can not afford any lengthy idle period , " said pfaffenbach , saying that all wto members would benefit if markets were opened .
ludwig georg braun , president of the federation of german chambers of industry and commerce dihk , called the breakdown a " harsh setback " for business .
" a major opportunity has been wasted , especially considering that the world economy is clouding over , " he said .
eu fears job losses before the talks ended , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson appealed to delegations to hammer out a deal on the opening of agricultural markets , an issue many observers thought had been resolved last friday . " if people do n't want this deal , there 's no better deal coming along and we just have to consider , if this fails , what they will lose , " he said earlier on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers say the pact 's failure could force them to cut jobs in the eu european automakers and trade unions said the talks ' failure could put european industrial jobs at risk . " the result could be major job losses in the european union , at the level of the manufacturers , but also in the supply chain , " peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation said in a statement . usa vs. china , india the agriculture row escalated when india and china refused to further open their agriculture markets , not wanting to entirely weaken the applicable mechanisms protecting their farmers .
delegates said negotiations stumbled on proposals for so-called ssm measures to protect poor farmers that would have imposed a special tariff on certain agricultural goods in the event of an import surge or price fall .
the two countries , saying they are speaking for some 100 developing countries , argued for a customs arrangement to protect farmers in poor countries against excessively high food imports . the differences have pitted the united states on one side and india and china on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab said the usa was still committed to the doha round of talks us trade representative susan schwab accused the two countries of undermining the hard-fought compromise package , saying the united states had made great concessions especially in regard to the removal of its cotton subsidies . " we were so close to getting this done , " schwab told reporters at wto headquarters after countries failed to compromise over measure to protect farmers in poor countries . time for a change of focus ? some wto representatives sympathized with the two developing countries , saying that in light of the still enormous numbers of poor that china and india have to care for , agricultural and food security in these countries had to be strengthened , not weakened by cheap imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues are currently less heated than agriculture disputes a large portion of poorer developing countries supported the indian-chinese position . with a new president taking office in the united states , changes in the european commission , and a possible election in india all occurring next year , the future of the doha round trade talks could be in jeopardy as leaders set new trade priorities , according to experts cited by the reuters news agency . " this fourth collapse after cancun , hong kong and potsdam suggests that the wto members may need to rethink the agenda rather than try again with the same program , " edward gresser , of the progressive policy institute in washington , told reuters . " in particular , they might move agricultural reform out of the center for a few years , and focus instead on big newly emerging industries … where attitudes are less entrenched and emotional .

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved .

" there is no use beating around the bush , this meeting has collapsed , members have simply not been able to bridge their differences , " lamy told journalists .
he said the 153 members of the wto needed time to decide on how to proceed .
" we will need to let the dust settle a bit , it 's probably difficult to look too far into the future at this point , " he said .
" wto members will need to have a sober look at if and how they bring the pieces back together , " he added .
germany voices deep disappointment germany said it was bitterly disappointed at the collapse of the doha round , saying it would press for the talks to reopen .
" an agreement at the multilateral trade negotiations would have been an important boost at the right moment for the world economy , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary at the economics ministry in berlin .
he said the german government would work insistently on a resumption of the talks as soon as possible .
" we can not afford any lengthy idle period , " said pfaffenbach , saying that all wto members would benefit if markets were opened .
ludwig georg braun , president of the federation of german chambers of industry and commerce dihk , called the breakdown a " harsh setback " for business .
" a major opportunity has been wasted , especially considering that the world economy is clouding over , " he said .
eu fears job losses before the talks ended , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson appealed to delegations to hammer out a deal on the opening of agricultural markets , an issue many observers thought had been resolved last friday . " if people do n't want this deal , there 's no better deal coming along and we just have to consider , if this fails , what they will lose , " he said earlier on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers say the pact 's failure could force them to cut jobs in the eu european automakers and trade unions said the talks ' failure could put european industrial jobs at risk . " the result could be major job losses in the european union , at the level of the manufacturers , but also in the supply chain , " peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation said in a statement . usa vs. china , india the agriculture row escalated when india and china refused to further open their agriculture markets , not wanting to entirely weaken the applicable mechanisms protecting their farmers .
delegates said negotiations stumbled on proposals for so-called ssm measures to protect poor farmers that would have imposed a special tariff on certain agricultural goods in the event of an import surge or price fall .
the two countries , saying they are speaking for some 100 developing countries , argued for a customs arrangement to protect farmers in poor countries against excessively high food imports . the differences have pitted the united states on one side and india and china on the other . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwab said the usa was still committed to the doha round of talks us trade representative susan schwab accused the two countries of undermining the hard-fought compromise package , saying the united states had made great concessions especially in regard to the removal of its cotton subsidies . " we were so close to getting this done , " schwab told reporters at wto headquarters after countries failed to compromise over measure to protect farmers in poor countries . time for a change of focus ? some wto representatives sympathized with the two developing countries , saying that in light of the still enormous numbers of poor that china and india have to care for , agricultural and food security in these countries had to be strengthened , not weakened by cheap imports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy issues are currently less heated than agriculture disputes a large portion of poorer developing countries supported the indian-chinese position . with a new president taking office in the united states , changes in the european commission , and a possible election in india all occurring next year , the future of the doha round trade talks could be in jeopardy as leaders set new trade priorities , according to experts cited by the reuters news agency . " this fourth collapse after cancun , hong kong and potsdam suggests that the wto members may need to rethink the agenda rather than try again with the same program , " edward gresser , of the progressive policy institute in washington , told reuters . " in particular , they might move agricultural reform out of the center for a few years , and focus instead on big newly emerging industries … where attitudes are less entrenched and emotional .

luxury sports car manufacturer porsche did well this past fiscal year , with profits exceeding turnover .
that meant a hefty bonus for ceo wendelin wiedeking , leading some to complain that german managers earn too much . porsche chief wiedeking could earn as much as 100 million euros -lrb- $ 157 million -rrb- this year for his contribution to the carmaker 's success , a steep increase on the 60 million euros he earned last year . in response , the opposition left party once again said that the german government should cap top managers ' salaries . the grand coalition of christian and social democrats is " incapable of putting an end to managers ' brazen self-serving , " left party head oskar lafontaine told the berliner zeitung on tuesday , july 29 . " it 's much too intertwined with the top managers . " if the government is too hesitant , it should at least take the left party 's other suggestion and drastically raise taxes for incomes above 600,000 euros , " lafontaine added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking helped make porsche profitable porsche , however , was quick to point out that wiedeking 's estimated income was still mere speculation . " even lafontaine knows that managers ' salaries are fixed by the board of directors , " a porsche spokesman told der spiegel newsmagazine 's online edition . a case for the extra zeroes the german mass-circulation tabloid bild , however , argued in its tuesday edition that wiedeking has fairly earned every euro of his pay check . when wiedeking took charge of porsche in 1992 , the carmaker was nearly broke , wrote the paper , but the new ceo injected his private funds into the company to get it back on track .
his management strategy worked and over the next decade and a half porsche grew in value from 300 million to some 17 billion euros , making it the most profitable carmaker in the world . as a result , the porsche family reportedly rewarded wiedeking with a 1 percent share in company profits . the unusual accounting situation for this past fiscal year resulted from the revaluation of porsche 's 31-percent share in volkswagen , according to reports . the stuttgart-based carmaker would earn more than 11 billion euros on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros for the financial year ending on july 31 . porsche 's attempt to acquire control of volkswagen has been hindered by the state of lower saxony , where vw 's headquarters are located .
the state owns a 20.3-percent stake in the company but a special provision in a disputed german law allows it to block major decisions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german airline cancelled 70 flights amid concerns that the strikes could damage the economy . prolonged industrial action could hurt germany 's economy , which is already suffering from soaring energy prices , the global credit crunch and an overly strong euro , the government 's tourism chief ernst hinsken said on tuesday . " strikes such as those at lufthansa could pose a serious risk to the german economy , " he told the daily passauer neue presse . most flights still running service was cancelled to domestic and european destinations for the second day on tuesday , a spokesman said , but the grounded flights represented just three percent of those scheduled by the carrier .
long-haul flights were operating normally , he said . a walk-out by ground maintenance personnel forced the cancellations . about 5,000 maintenance , freight and catering staff stopped work on monday in frankfurt and hamburg but few flights were disrupted on the first day .
berlin was added on tuesday , with stuttgart to follow later in the evening , thus affecting all of lufthansa 's locations in the country . verdi wants a 9.8 percent pay hike over a year for around 50,000 workers , while lufthansa has offered 6.7 percent over 21 months and appealed for another round of negotiations . verdi has said it wo n't negotiate until lufthansa comes back with a higher offer . " we 're prepared to keep the strikes going for a long time , " said verdi spokesman helmut reutter . hurting lufthansa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all lufthansa employees are supporting the strike according to experts , prolonged strikes could cause heavy losses for the airlines , particularly due to a loss in business travelers , who tend to book spontaneously and choose higher-priced business or first class seats . tourists , on the other hand , " rebook and put up with delayed departures and arrivals , " said aviation expert cord schellenberg , according to dpa news agency .
" the most important thing is that they reach their destination . " verdi said it was doing what it could to avoid inconveniencing travelers while it ratcheted up the pressure on lufthansa . " the goal of the strike is not to hinder passengers but to increase the cost to the company , " verdi 's chief negotiator erhard ott said monday , noting that ordering catering from other firms or docking planes in other hangars was " very pricey . " as the largest aircraft maintenance service provider in germany , lufthansa would likely have a difficult time finding replacements on the ground , industry experts said . ott added that lufthansa had already seen a decline in reservations in recent weeks as wary passengers booked with other carriers . the newspaper die welt quoted verdi as saying the strike would cost lufthansa five million euros -lrb- $ 7.9 million -rrb- a day . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is no use beating around the bush , this meeting has collapsed , members have simply not been able to bridge their differences , " lamy told journalists .
he said the 153 members of the wto needed time to decide on how to proceed .
" we will need to let the dust settle a bit , it 's probably difficult to look too far into the future at this point , " he said .
" wto members will need to have a sober look at if and how they bring the pieces back together , " he added .
germany voices deep disappointment germany said it was bitterly disappointed at the collapse of the doha round , saying it would press for the talks to reopen .
" an agreement at the multilateral trade negotiations would have been an important boost at the right moment for the world economy , " said bernd pfaffenbach , state secretary at the economics ministry in berlin .
he said the german government would work insistently on a resumption of the talks as soon as possible .
" we can not afford any lengthy idle period , " said pfaffenbach , saying that all wto members would benefit if markets were opened .
ludwig georg braun , president of the federation of german chambers of industry and commerce dihk , called the breakdown a " harsh setback " for business .
" a major opportunity has been wasted , especially considering that the world economy is clouding over , " he said .
eu fears job losses before the talks ended , eu trade commissioner peter mandelson appealed to delegations to hammer out a deal on the opening of agricultural markets , an issue many observers thought had been resolved last friday . " if people do n't want this deal , there 's no better deal coming along and we just have to consider , if this fails , what they will lose , " he said earlier on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers say the pact 's failure could force them to cut jobs in the eu european automakers and trade unions said the talks ' failure could put european industrial jobs at risk . " the result could be major job losses in the european union , at the level of the manufacturers , but also in the supply chain , " peter scherrer , general secretary of the european metalworkers ' federation said in a statement . usa vs. china , india the agriculture row escalated when india and china refused to further open their agriculture markets , not wanting to entirely weaken the applicable mechanisms protecting their farmers .

his management strategy worked and over the next decade and a half porsche grew in value from 300 million to some 17 billion euros , making it the most profitable carmaker in the world . as a result , the porsche family reportedly rewarded wiedeking with a 1 percent share in company profits . the unusual accounting situation for this past fiscal year resulted from the revaluation of porsche 's 31-percent share in volkswagen , according to reports . the stuttgart-based carmaker would earn more than 11 billion euros on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros for the financial year ending on july 31 . porsche 's attempt to acquire control of volkswagen has been hindered by the state of lower saxony , where vw 's headquarters are located .

" if the government is too hesitant , it should at least take the left party 's other suggestion and drastically raise taxes for incomes above 600,000 euros , " lafontaine added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiedeking helped make porsche profitable porsche , however , was quick to point out that wiedeking 's estimated income was still mere speculation . " even lafontaine knows that managers ' salaries are fixed by the board of directors , " a porsche spokesman told der spiegel newsmagazine 's online edition . a case for the extra zeroes the german mass-circulation tabloid bild , however , argued in its tuesday edition that wiedeking has fairly earned every euro of his pay check . when wiedeking took charge of porsche in 1992 , the carmaker was nearly broke , wrote the paper , but the new ceo injected his private funds into the company to get it back on track .
his management strategy worked and over the next decade and a half porsche grew in value from 300 million to some 17 billion euros , making it the most profitable carmaker in the world . as a result , the porsche family reportedly rewarded wiedeking with a 1 percent share in company profits . the unusual accounting situation for this past fiscal year resulted from the revaluation of porsche 's 31-percent share in volkswagen , according to reports . the stuttgart-based carmaker would earn more than 11 billion euros on turnover of just 8.6 billion euros for the financial year ending on july 31 . porsche 's attempt to acquire control of volkswagen has been hindered by the state of lower saxony , where vw 's headquarters are located .
the state owns a 20.3-percent stake in the company but a special provision in a disputed german law allows it to block major decisions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german airline cancelled 70 flights amid concerns that the strikes could damage the economy . prolonged industrial action could hurt germany 's economy , which is already suffering from soaring energy prices , the global credit crunch and an overly strong euro , the government 's tourism chief ernst hinsken said on tuesday . " strikes such as those at lufthansa could pose a serious risk to the german economy , " he told the daily passauer neue presse . most flights still running service was cancelled to domestic and european destinations for the second day on tuesday , a spokesman said , but the grounded flights represented just three percent of those scheduled by the carrier .
long-haul flights were operating normally , he said . a walk-out by ground maintenance personnel forced the cancellations . about 5,000 maintenance , freight and catering staff stopped work on monday in frankfurt and hamburg but few flights were disrupted on the first day .

" the most important thing is that they reach their destination . " verdi said it was doing what it could to avoid inconveniencing travelers while it ratcheted up the pressure on lufthansa . " the goal of the strike is not to hinder passengers but to increase the cost to the company , " verdi 's chief negotiator erhard ott said monday , noting that ordering catering from other firms or docking planes in other hangars was " very pricey . " as the largest aircraft maintenance service provider in germany , lufthansa would likely have a difficult time finding replacements on the ground , industry experts said . ott added that lufthansa had already seen a decline in reservations in recent weeks as wary passengers booked with other carriers . the newspaper die welt quoted verdi as saying the strike would cost lufthansa five million euros -lrb- $ 7.9 million -rrb- a day . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back . " fischer added that the bloc needed to take a " flexible approach " to cooperation between states on key issues in order to move forward after the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty , which foresees creating a new post to steer european foreign and security policy . fischer swayed green pacifists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in the greens supported fischer 's call for military action in kosovo a former leader of the german greens party , fischer was instrumental in convincing his fellow party members to turn away from the party 's pacifist roots and to support nato efforts in the balkans in the late 1990s .
it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .
he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .

the german airline cancelled 70 flights amid concerns that the strikes could damage the economy . prolonged industrial action could hurt germany 's economy , which is already suffering from soaring energy prices , the global credit crunch and an overly strong euro , the government 's tourism chief ernst hinsken said on tuesday . " strikes such as those at lufthansa could pose a serious risk to the german economy , " he told the daily passauer neue presse . most flights still running service was cancelled to domestic and european destinations for the second day on tuesday , a spokesman said , but the grounded flights represented just three percent of those scheduled by the carrier .
long-haul flights were operating normally , he said . a walk-out by ground maintenance personnel forced the cancellations . about 5,000 maintenance , freight and catering staff stopped work on monday in frankfurt and hamburg but few flights were disrupted on the first day .
berlin was added on tuesday , with stuttgart to follow later in the evening , thus affecting all of lufthansa 's locations in the country . verdi wants a 9.8 percent pay hike over a year for around 50,000 workers , while lufthansa has offered 6.7 percent over 21 months and appealed for another round of negotiations . verdi has said it wo n't negotiate until lufthansa comes back with a higher offer . " we 're prepared to keep the strikes going for a long time , " said verdi spokesman helmut reutter . hurting lufthansa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all lufthansa employees are supporting the strike according to experts , prolonged strikes could cause heavy losses for the airlines , particularly due to a loss in business travelers , who tend to book spontaneously and choose higher-priced business or first class seats . tourists , on the other hand , " rebook and put up with delayed departures and arrivals , " said aviation expert cord schellenberg , according to dpa news agency .
" the most important thing is that they reach their destination . " verdi said it was doing what it could to avoid inconveniencing travelers while it ratcheted up the pressure on lufthansa . " the goal of the strike is not to hinder passengers but to increase the cost to the company , " verdi 's chief negotiator erhard ott said monday , noting that ordering catering from other firms or docking planes in other hangars was " very pricey . " as the largest aircraft maintenance service provider in germany , lufthansa would likely have a difficult time finding replacements on the ground , industry experts said . ott added that lufthansa had already seen a decline in reservations in recent weeks as wary passengers booked with other carriers . the newspaper die welt quoted verdi as saying the strike would cost lufthansa five million euros -lrb- $ 7.9 million -rrb- a day . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 'll be a worldwide first , he says . ulrich schroeder , 58 , is n't likely to be missed , even in a crowd , wearing his top hat and black " shine the light " tunic emblazoned with rolling stones badges and myriad emblems . a former savings-bank clerk , schroeder has been a fan and high-volume collector of rolling stones memorabilia for over 40 years , attending 160 of the british group 's concerts around the world . now he is to open what he says is " the world 's first museum devoted exclusively to the rolling stones " in his hometown of luechow , southeast of the german city of hamburg . he has acquired a former supermarket and converted the space to house more than 4,000 rolling stones items he has amassed over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder has over 4,000 pieces of stones memorabilia schroeder , who expects to invest 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- in the stones museum , said the luechow town council is also backing the project with a 100,000-euro subsidy . a draw for stones fans across europe luechow is just a small town with a population of barely 10,000 , but schroeder told dpa news agency that he is not worried on that score . " the museum is likely to attract fans not only from neighboring cities like hamburg , bremen and wolfsburg , but also from the whole of europe , " he said . the museum , due to open in 2010 , will have a 600-square-meter -lrb- 6,500 square-foot -rrb- exhibition area to display hundreds of the group 's t-shirts , posters , hand-signed instruments , photos , books , dvds , super-8 and 35-millimetre films , rare stones single and lp records , concert tickets and press cuttings related to the evergreen pop group . in addition , schroeder said he will be exhibiting his own extensive collection of paintings and other art work by rolling stones guitarist ron wood . banking or sex and rock ' n ' roll ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with mick jagger at the helm , the rolling stones continue to draw huge crowds " ron woods is a talented artist who has produced a lot of paintings , etchings , wood cuts and mono prints down the years , " said the german .
in london , wood has a company producing copies of his art . schroeder agreed in london in the early 1990s to become woods ' personal art vendor , and went on to exhibit and sell woods ' art outside britain , notably in the netherlands , italy , switzerland and germany . invited to attend wood 's 50th birthday party in ireland in the mid-1990s , schroeder recalled him jokingly saying : " do you want to continue earning your living in a savings bank , or with sex , rock ' n ' roll ? " schroeder said he retorted he would like to be the guitarist 's art guru .
recently one of wood 's paintings sold for $ 1 million . bad press for woods in a dpa phone interview , schroeder said that when he first contemplated creating a stones museum , several people in the entertainment business signalled interest , with one collector even offering him a seven-figure sum for his stones possessions . " but i 'd set my heart on creating the museum in luechow , out of loyalty to my hometown , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder served as wood 's personal art vendor asked about his long-standing friendship with wood and his family , schroeder said at first the link had more to do with art than music . " i found his paintings exciting and provocative , " he said . recently , wood made unwelcome headlines in tabloid newspapers , with reports of alcohol problems and a fling with a 19-year-old kazakhstani waitress .
schroeder would not discuss the reports . not in it for the money wrapped up in his museum plans , he says all other rock museums have a wider focus and he believes his will be the first " devoted exclusively to the rolling stones . " " i know the museum wo n't make me rich .
but then but that 's not the point of the exercise , " said the devoted stones fan . he is to register the name " rock & art museum luechow " as an exclusive trademark shortly , said schroeder .
films and concerts would also be staged in the museum and a " rock cafe " will serve food and drinks to visitors . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants .

in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda . " fears of a foray to western turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three german climbers were held hostage by kurdish rebels for 12 days whether responsible or not , the rebel movement has been blamed for a number of events in turkey since its inception in 1984 .
the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved .

the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back . " fischer added that the bloc needed to take a " flexible approach " to cooperation between states on key issues in order to move forward after the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty , which foresees creating a new post to steer european foreign and security policy . fischer swayed green pacifists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in the greens supported fischer 's call for military action in kosovo a former leader of the german greens party , fischer was instrumental in convincing his fellow party members to turn away from the party 's pacifist roots and to support nato efforts in the balkans in the late 1990s .
it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back . " fischer added that the bloc needed to take a " flexible approach " to cooperation between states on key issues in order to move forward after the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty , which foresees creating a new post to steer european foreign and security policy . fischer swayed green pacifists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in the greens supported fischer 's call for military action in kosovo a former leader of the german greens party , fischer was instrumental in convincing his fellow party members to turn away from the party 's pacifist roots and to support nato efforts in the balkans in the late 1990s .
it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .
he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .
" it is down to heads of government to demand progress - and to do more to explain to their publics and parliaments how vital this is for the security of every european .

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back . " fischer added that the bloc needed to take a " flexible approach " to cooperation between states on key issues in order to move forward after the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty , which foresees creating a new post to steer european foreign and security policy . fischer swayed green pacifists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in the greens supported fischer 's call for military action in kosovo a former leader of the german greens party , fischer was instrumental in convincing his fellow party members to turn away from the party 's pacifist roots and to support nato efforts in the balkans in the late 1990s .
it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .
he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .
" it is down to heads of government to demand progress - and to do more to explain to their publics and parliaments how vital this is for the security of every european .

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back . " fischer added that the bloc needed to take a " flexible approach " to cooperation between states on key issues in order to move forward after the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty , which foresees creating a new post to steer european foreign and security policy . fischer swayed green pacifists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in the greens supported fischer 's call for military action in kosovo a former leader of the german greens party , fischer was instrumental in convincing his fellow party members to turn away from the party 's pacifist roots and to support nato efforts in the balkans in the late 1990s .
it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .
he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .
" it is down to heads of government to demand progress - and to do more to explain to their publics and parliaments how vital this is for the security of every european .

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that renewed focus on the group does n't bode well for many kurds abroad . citing security sources , cnn-turk television said that intelligence reports suggested the group was planning a bombing campaign in turkish cities . though the firat news agency reported monday that the pkk had denied responsibility for the blast - which killed 17 and injured more than 150 , making it the worst in the city since 2003 - suspicions about kurdish involvement still abound . " there are signs of links to the separatist group , " istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters . " of course it 's the pkk , " orhan balci , a 38-year-old textile businessman from the area told reuters news service .
" this has nothing to do with politics , this is all about the pkk . " prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on monday could not be called out into naming the pkk as the culprits behind the pair of bombings saying only , " turkey 's fight against terrorism will continue " and that " the terrorist group 's biggest aim is to make propaganda .

the most recent headline-making action before this weekend 's blast - the kidnapping and eventual release of three german climbers from the slopes of mount ararat - has led many to worry that the battle for an autonomous kurdistan may spread into western turkey . this fear poses a special problem for germany , which is home to one of the largest turkish expatriate communities and provides shelter for more than half a million kurds .
much of the fear and hostility felt toward ethnic kurds in turkey as a consequence of the pkk 's actions has long simmered among the immigrant population in germany . in november , demonstrations over turkey 's foray into kurdish territory in northern iraq broke out in berlin 's neu-koelln neighborhood and members of the turkish nationalist " gray wolf " gang attacked people at a kurdish culture center in the german capital .
in february , the berliner zeitung reported on the bullying and harassment a 7-year-old kurd received at school after wearing a scarf in the colors of kurdistan . " we 're trying to live in peace with the turks , " evrim baba , a representative of the kurdish community in berlin told the newspaper . " we want peace , " a young man named achmed told dw-world after the november attacks . a community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds disagree on whether they owe any particular loyalty to the pkk that peace has proven difficult to attain .
even among members of the kurdish community itself , there is disagreement about the pkk .
though germany officially banned the pkk in 1993 , many of the exiles here openly sympathize with the organization 's struggle to obtain an autonomous homeland in the triangular area of southern turkey , northern iraq , and northwest iran . " the kurds have an incredible debt toward this organization , " mahmut seven , who runs the only kurdish daily newspaper yeni özgür politika , told the german newsmagazine der spiegel .
" they gave us back our pride and our identity . " baktheyar ibrahim , an iraqi-kurd who had to flee a well-paying government job in saddam hussein 's iraq , sees things another way .
as a supporter of the patriotic union of kurdistan political party , he believes in the attainment of an independent kurdistan through democratic processes .
the group , which supports iraqi president jalal talabani , often finds itself at odds with other organizations fighting for the same goals . but the pkk has made things especially difficult for ibrahim and for other exiles like him in recent months as germany 's instituted a major crackdown on the kurdish population to curb pkk sympathies . kurdish associations in hannover , kassel , bremen , koblenz and berlin have all been raided by german security agencies and suspected members of the separatist movement taken into custody . roj tv , the sole kurdish television station in the country , was banned last june , followed shortly by a ban on the production company viko , which is located in the western germany city of wuppertal . citing political reforms in turkey , the german government has carried out a number of asylum revocations , making the search for political refuge more difficult and angering moderate kurds who do n't see the situation in turkey as having improved . " go back to turkey ? " asked mostafa , a 32-year-old refugee from istanbul who 's since become a naturalized german .
" for me , that 's impossible . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 'll be a worldwide first , he says . ulrich schroeder , 58 , is n't likely to be missed , even in a crowd , wearing his top hat and black " shine the light " tunic emblazoned with rolling stones badges and myriad emblems . a former savings-bank clerk , schroeder has been a fan and high-volume collector of rolling stones memorabilia for over 40 years , attending 160 of the british group 's concerts around the world . now he is to open what he says is " the world 's first museum devoted exclusively to the rolling stones " in his hometown of luechow , southeast of the german city of hamburg . he has acquired a former supermarket and converted the space to house more than 4,000 rolling stones items he has amassed over the years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder has over 4,000 pieces of stones memorabilia schroeder , who expects to invest 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- in the stones museum , said the luechow town council is also backing the project with a 100,000-euro subsidy . a draw for stones fans across europe luechow is just a small town with a population of barely 10,000 , but schroeder told dpa news agency that he is not worried on that score . " the museum is likely to attract fans not only from neighboring cities like hamburg , bremen and wolfsburg , but also from the whole of europe , " he said . the museum , due to open in 2010 , will have a 600-square-meter -lrb- 6,500 square-foot -rrb- exhibition area to display hundreds of the group 's t-shirts , posters , hand-signed instruments , photos , books , dvds , super-8 and 35-millimetre films , rare stones single and lp records , concert tickets and press cuttings related to the evergreen pop group . in addition , schroeder said he will be exhibiting his own extensive collection of paintings and other art work by rolling stones guitarist ron wood . banking or sex and rock ' n ' roll ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with mick jagger at the helm , the rolling stones continue to draw huge crowds " ron woods is a talented artist who has produced a lot of paintings , etchings , wood cuts and mono prints down the years , " said the german .
in london , wood has a company producing copies of his art . schroeder agreed in london in the early 1990s to become woods ' personal art vendor , and went on to exhibit and sell woods ' art outside britain , notably in the netherlands , italy , switzerland and germany . invited to attend wood 's 50th birthday party in ireland in the mid-1990s , schroeder recalled him jokingly saying : " do you want to continue earning your living in a savings bank , or with sex , rock ' n ' roll ? " schroeder said he retorted he would like to be the guitarist 's art guru .
recently one of wood 's paintings sold for $ 1 million . bad press for woods in a dpa phone interview , schroeder said that when he first contemplated creating a stones museum , several people in the entertainment business signalled interest , with one collector even offering him a seven-figure sum for his stones possessions . " but i 'd set my heart on creating the museum in luechow , out of loyalty to my hometown , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schroeder served as wood 's personal art vendor asked about his long-standing friendship with wood and his family , schroeder said at first the link had more to do with art than music . " i found his paintings exciting and provocative , " he said . recently , wood made unwelcome headlines in tabloid newspapers , with reports of alcohol problems and a fling with a 19-year-old kazakhstani waitress .
schroeder would not discuss the reports . not in it for the money wrapped up in his museum plans , he says all other rock museums have a wider focus and he believes his will be the first " devoted exclusively to the rolling stones . " " i know the museum wo n't make me rich .
but then but that 's not the point of the exercise , " said the devoted stones fan . he is to register the name " rock & art museum luechow " as an exclusive trademark shortly , said schroeder .
films and concerts would also be staged in the museum and a " rock cafe " will serve food and drinks to visitors . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this year there is a new twist : opera live on the internet .
is this the future for opera ? the gala event of the opera world is currently underway in the bavarian city of bayreuth .
actual tickets to the bayreuth festival , which takes place every year from july 25 to aug .
28 , are among the most elusive in the world , with a waiting list of 10 years or more .
but this year opera fans who have not been given the honor of paying the entrance fee have two other choices : a live screening in the center of town or a live stream via the internet .
wagner meets the web bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are up to 10,000 online tickets up for grabs until aug .
2 now while watching a world-class opera while sitting on your couch in a pair of boxer shorts might sound like a good idea , it comes with a price : 49 euros -lrb- $ 77 -rrb- to be exact .
for this one-time fee viewers were given the chance to watch katarina wagner 's interpretation of her great-grandfather 's opera " the mastersingers of nuremberg " live on sunday night . bayreuth performances have been broadcast live on the radio from the festival for decades , but the live internet stream also provides a look at the opera .
in addition to seeing the actual opera itself , which ran for over six hours , webcast ticket holders were able to take a glimpse backstage and can watch the performance once more any time before aug .
2 . the internet broadcast was limited to 10,000 subscribers , including any who choose to sign up to watch after the live showing . the company in charge of the stream , bf medien , said it will not announce how many people logged on to see the performance until after the aug .
2 cut-off date . fan mile for opera buffs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people , like german chancellor angela merkel , do n't have to wait on a list for tickets for those who did n't have high speed internet , or felt 49 euros was too high a price to pay , there was also a live screening on bayreuth 's " fan mile . " it is estimated that 38,000 people came to watch the opera , which was filmed using eight different cameras .
the number includes multiple comings and goings during the event sunday afternoon , so the number of people who attended was far lower , festival spokesman peter emmerich said .
only 15,000 were allowed in front of the 90-square-meter -lrb- 969-square-foot -rrb- screen at any one time . emmerich said that if the free event were to be repeated , it would require a corporate sponsor to step forward .
this year 's event was backed by 150,000 euros from the german electronics and engineering conglomerate siemens . the two new viewing options are sure to help more people appreciate opera , according to alexander busche , who helped to organize both the webcast and the public viewing . he said the viewing was like watching german soccer fans surrounding a screen in a beer garden during a championship match - only quieter . " it was amazing to see thousands of people sitting there , quietly staring at the screen , " busche said .
" you almost didn ’ t want to move for fear of disturbing them . " the future of opera ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are only seats for 2,000 visitors in the bayreuth opera house and no air conditioning live streams are becoming more and more common , but whether this will be a lasting trend remains to be seen .
the most downloaded webcasts are news programs and sitcoms , usually provided for free by national and international broadcasters . other leading opera houses , including la scala in milan and the metropolitan opera in new york , have regularly offered high-definition theater-casts in the past .
the met is currently about to open its third season offering live broadcasts of operas .
though instead of being offered for 49 euros on your laptop , they go for about 15 euros -lrb- $ 22 -rrb- and are broadcast in regular movie theaters .
the met currently has broadcasts in 17 countries , including germany , as well as regular live radio broadcasts , said peter clark , spokesman for the new york opera house . according to sebastian rohver with the hamburg based internet consulting firm fittkau and maaß , 90 percent of all german internet users have taken advantage of live streams and 72 percent believe they are the future of television and other events like sports and concerts .
but paying for the privilege remains a sticking point to some . " as to whether or not people will be willing to pay such a large amount of money to watch something of unknown quality is very doubtful , " rohver said . mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the bloc needs a flexible defense policy . a group eu nations should form a " pioneering group " to deal with issues of european security and defense , fischer said tuesday , july 28 , at the presentation of a european council on foreign relations study . " we must recognize the reality of a ' multi-speed europe ' on defense , " said fischer , one of the council 's co-chairs .
" the reluctant should not be bullied , but neither must they hold the others back . " fischer added that the bloc needed to take a " flexible approach " to cooperation between states on key issues in order to move forward after the irish rejection of the lisbon treaty , which foresees creating a new post to steer european foreign and security policy . fischer swayed green pacifists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone in the greens supported fischer 's call for military action in kosovo a former leader of the german greens party , fischer was instrumental in convincing his fellow party members to turn away from the party 's pacifist roots and to support nato efforts in the balkans in the late 1990s .
it represented the first time german soldiers conducted military operations since world war ii . though he opposed sending troops to iraq , fischer lent his support to the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan . if such a european reaction force were created it would be able to react to violence around the globe such as in chad and congo , more effectively than allowed by current policies , according to the council 's report . european security in peril " europe 's security is being jeopardized by the reluctance of defense ministries to change and to work together , " said lord george robertson , former nato secretary general , and one of council 's members .
" stronger european defense cooperation will only strengthen nato . " " a large part of the 200 billion euros that europe spends on defense every year is simply wasted , " the study says . the report reprimanded eu nations for a haphazard system of inefficient military spending that is hindering the bloc from making better contributions to global security , according to the study 's author , nick witney .
he added that the eu will only be a worthwhile security partner with the united states if members pool their resources . " for defense ministries , change and cooperation are deeply counter-cultural , " witney wrote .
" it is down to heads of government to demand progress - and to do more to explain to their publics and parliaments how vital this is for the security of every european .

the company accuses them of supervisory failings in the period 2003 to 2006 . the company " bases its claims on breaches of their organizational and supervisory duties in view of the accusations of illegal business practices and extensive bribery " that marked operations from 2003 to 2006 . investigations ongoing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von pierer ran siemens for 13 years and became president of the supervisory board in 2005 the decision follows a first conviction in the corruption scandal when a court in munich on monday , july 28 imposed a 108,000 euro -lrb- $ 170,000 -rrb- fine and a two-year suspended sentence on reinhard siekaczek following an eight-week trial .
prosecutors gave extensive testimony and documentation in the case about a companywide system of slush funds and illicit payments . german justice officials are also still investigating the company as part of a probe that began in 2006 and has shaken the engineering giant to its core . the company agreed in october to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
because the firm 's shares are also listed in the united states , it is subject to a potentially damaging - and expensive - probe by the us securities and exchange commission . the supervisory board said it would give the former managers the chance to address the charges before officially taking legal action .
the board also said it would cut all ties , including consultant contracts , business cars and office space , to the accused . the decision to sue is a first in the normally cozy world of big german corporations where past management errors are usually ignored . an internal inquiry has exposed 1.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.57 billion -rrb- in payments by siemens for apparently fictitious services by " consultants . "
in reality the money was used to buy influence , investigators believe . current ceo peter loescher was brought in from outside the company a year ago to get to the bottom of the elaborate system of kickbacks and slush funds that appear to have penetrated all levels of operations . the supervisory board did not specify how much they would demand of the former executives . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's karl zawadzky argues that it will take a lot more time and money to find and punish those ultimately responsible . munich judge peter noll summed up the siemens bribery affair very succinctly when he said that a " system of organized irresponsibility " had developed over time in the international conglomerate .
a total of 1.3 billion euros was diverted into slush funds held in banks in switzerland and liechtenstein and the money used as kickbacks to win big contracts in many countries abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky the first trial centered on 57-year-old reinhard siekaczek , a former manager in the telecommunications division com .
he was responsible with filling one of the numerous slush funds - on 49 occasions with a total of 48.8 million euros .
other people used the cash in a bid to swing decisions in siemens ' favor when the competition for contracts was tough .
the court sentenced him to two years on probation and fined him 108,000 euros .
the sentence was so lenient because siekaczek was acting on the instructions of his superiors and had made a full confession . long and difficult process ahead siekaczek 's trial may be over , but the courts will continue to probe the " system of organized irresponsibility " at siemens .
this is going to be a difficult and protracted process .
for example , it was not possible to determine which of the former siemens bosses were involved in the corruption affair and in what way .
nor was it possible to find out exactly where the money went . it is not only the german legal system that is concerned with resolving this issue .
the new company management under the leadership of board chairman peter loescher is investing a lot of money and energy into clearing up the matter .
it has already cost the company more than 500 million euros in lawyers ' and management consultants ' fees and fines .
this is set to rise considerably . but the main aim must be to call to account those ultimately responsible for creating this slush fund - either by explicit decree , or by tacit agreement with the practice - scandal in one of germany 's oldest and most reputable corporate groups .
after all , it is barely imaginable that boardroom members did not notice the disappearance of huge sums of money or the everyday practice of handing out kickbacks . top managers being called to account the board of directors and the current siemens chairman want to prosecute the entire former top management of the group so that they can determine exactly who knew what and who did what in every single case .
state prosecutors are already investigating whether executives acted with the duty of care laid down in stock corporation law .
if the former board of directors are shown to have neglected that duty , then the board members will be held jointly liable . in addition , there are also allegations of certain individuals embezzling millions of euros .
even if executives were not actively involved in the bribery payments , they are accused of not doing everything they could to nip this kind of slush fund system in the bud .
siemens anti-corruption department was completely inadequate to this task and not commensurate with the importance of this topic in an international conglomerate . under german law , it is illegal for german companies to make bribes .
some 10 years ago , this legislation only applied to germany itself , but it was then extended to cover corporate activities abroad . everyone knows that it is impossible to gain large contracts in many countries without kickbacks .
in the past , such payments could even be offset against tax for that very reason .
but increasingly , it has become accepted knowledge that corruption is one of biggest problems facing developing countries .
it stands in the way of democracy and the rule of law .
it is also clear that corruption involves two parties : one that demands kickbacks and the other that supplies them .
industrialized nations agreed to ban the practice in the mid-1990s in a bid to root out this evil .
the ban also applies to siemens . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a mess , " the commission said .
its findings were based on discussions with people involved in the criminal justice system , that had demonstrated the " breadth and depth of discontent " with the current arrangements .
a year later , another law commission review said the homicide law was a " rickety structure set upon shaky foundations " .
some of the rules had been in place since the 17th century , the commission said , other rules were uncertain or constantly changing , creating a situation where the law could not be stated with " clarity or certainty " .
it recommended a new homicide act , to replace the 1957 version , which would bring together all the relevant case law .
in a further review , published in 2006 , the commission suggested a three-tier system for homicide cases , depending on their seriousness .
these were first-degree murder , carrying a mandatory life sentence ; second-degree murder , with a life term at the discretion of the judge plus sentence guidelines ; and manslaughter , also with a maximum penalty of life .
wholesale review so what had prompted the law commission to look into the troubled question of murder legislation and come up with such a radical blueprint for reform ?
the answer may have some relevance for those considering whether or not the latest government proposals will work .
what had prompted the commission 's extensive review was turning the spotlight on the partial legal defence of " provocation " - just the issue the government is now tackling .
the commission said , in 2004 , that changes to the " provocation " rules were unlikely to work without fundamental reform to the murder laws .
and so it ploughed on with a wholesale review of homicide legislation .
danger remains the government , on the other hand , after reading the law commission 's reports carefully , has decided to do it differently .
no grand shake-up , no bonfire of legislation , no radical restructuring .
instead , it 's taking the murder reforms step by complex step , with new rules on provocation and some technical , and relatively uncontroversial , adjustments to the law on diminished responsibility , complicity and infanticide .
the thinking behind it is that ministers will have more support for these measures , than they would for a shake-up involving a graded system of murders , which could see an end to the mandatory life sentence in some cases .
that may prove to be true .
but the danger that the law commission and other experts have identified remains .

it recommended a new homicide act , to replace the 1957 version , which would bring together all the relevant case law .
in a further review , published in 2006 , the commission suggested a three-tier system for homicide cases , depending on their seriousness .
these were first-degree murder , carrying a mandatory life sentence ; second-degree murder , with a life term at the discretion of the judge plus sentence guidelines ; and manslaughter , also with a maximum penalty of life .

the answer may have some relevance for those considering whether or not the latest government proposals will work .
what had prompted the commission 's extensive review was turning the spotlight on the partial legal defence of " provocation " - just the issue the government is now tackling .
the commission said , in 2004 , that changes to the " provocation " rules were unlikely to work without fundamental reform to the murder laws .

no grand shake-up , no bonfire of legislation , no radical restructuring .

the thinking behind it is that ministers will have more support for these measures , than they would for a shake-up involving a graded system of murders , which could see an end to the mandatory life sentence in some cases .
that may prove to be true .
but the danger that the law commission and other experts have identified remains .
that is that the offence of " murder " , under current law , encompasses such a wide variety of scenarios , from mercy killings to serial murders , from crimes of passion to contract killings , that it is a recipe for confusion and injustice in the courts .

" it 's a mess , " the commission said .
its findings were based on discussions with people involved in the criminal justice system , that had demonstrated the " breadth and depth of discontent " with the current arrangements .
a year later , another law commission review said the homicide law was a " rickety structure set upon shaky foundations " .
some of the rules had been in place since the 17th century , the commission said , other rules were uncertain or constantly changing , creating a situation where the law could not be stated with " clarity or certainty " .
it recommended a new homicide act , to replace the 1957 version , which would bring together all the relevant case law .
in a further review , published in 2006 , the commission suggested a three-tier system for homicide cases , depending on their seriousness .
these were first-degree murder , carrying a mandatory life sentence ; second-degree murder , with a life term at the discretion of the judge plus sentence guidelines ; and manslaughter , also with a maximum penalty of life .
wholesale review so what had prompted the law commission to look into the troubled question of murder legislation and come up with such a radical blueprint for reform ?
the answer may have some relevance for those considering whether or not the latest government proposals will work .
what had prompted the commission 's extensive review was turning the spotlight on the partial legal defence of " provocation " - just the issue the government is now tackling .
the commission said , in 2004 , that changes to the " provocation " rules were unlikely to work without fundamental reform to the murder laws .
and so it ploughed on with a wholesale review of homicide legislation .
danger remains the government , on the other hand , after reading the law commission 's reports carefully , has decided to do it differently .
no grand shake-up , no bonfire of legislation , no radical restructuring .
instead , it 's taking the murder reforms step by complex step , with new rules on provocation and some technical , and relatively uncontroversial , adjustments to the law on diminished responsibility , complicity and infanticide .
the thinking behind it is that ministers will have more support for these measures , than they would for a shake-up involving a graded system of murders , which could see an end to the mandatory life sentence in some cases .
that may prove to be true .
but the danger that the law commission and other experts have identified remains .
that is that the offence of " murder " , under current law , encompasses such a wide variety of scenarios , from mercy killings to serial murders , from crimes of passion to contract killings , that it is a recipe for confusion and injustice in the courts .

security minister paul goggins said the aim was to bring the law up to date and give confidence to the public and victims ' families .
mr goggins said it would " ensure that the punishment fits the crime " .
" the unlawful taking of life is the most serious matter which our criminal courts have to deal with , " said the security minister .
" the law needs to be clear and fair so that people have confidence in the criminal justice system .
we want to have an open and inclusive debate on the issues before we introduce any changes to the law . "
the most controversial proposal affects cases of domestic homicide .
it would mean that defendants who successfully claimed to have been " seriously wronged " or in fear of " serious violence " would be convicted of manslaughter rather than murder .
under current laws , people who kill their partner after years of abuse are at risk of being convicted of murder , which carries a life sentence .
but as part of the government 's plans , victims of sustained abuse who are accused of murder would have a statutory legal defence .
if they can show they were in fear of serious violence from the person they killed , they will be convicted of manslaughter for which the sentence is less severe .
this would also apply to a rape victim who kills their attacker .
a further measure would prevent defendants escaping a murder conviction by claiming they were provoked by their partner being unfaithful .
the consultation was welcomed by the chief executive of the northern ireland law commission judena goldring .
" the commission will be considering the government 's proposals in this important area , " she said .
" in line with our desire to see greater participation in the development of law , we encourage everyone with an interest to consider the consultation paper and make their views known . "
the same issues are being looked at in england and wales .

security minister paul goggins said the aim was to bring the law up to date and give confidence to the public and victims ' families .
mr goggins said it would " ensure that the punishment fits the crime " .
" the unlawful taking of life is the most serious matter which our criminal courts have to deal with , " said the security minister .
" the law needs to be clear and fair so that people have confidence in the criminal justice system .
we want to have an open and inclusive debate on the issues before we introduce any changes to the law . "
the most controversial proposal affects cases of domestic homicide .
it would mean that defendants who successfully claimed to have been " seriously wronged " or in fear of " serious violence " would be convicted of manslaughter rather than murder .
under current laws , people who kill their partner after years of abuse are at risk of being convicted of murder , which carries a life sentence .
but as part of the government 's plans , victims of sustained abuse who are accused of murder would have a statutory legal defence .
if they can show they were in fear of serious violence from the person they killed , they will be convicted of manslaughter for which the sentence is less severe .
this would also apply to a rape victim who kills their attacker .
a further measure would prevent defendants escaping a murder conviction by claiming they were provoked by their partner being unfaithful .
the consultation was welcomed by the chief executive of the northern ireland law commission judena goldring .
" the commission will be considering the government 's proposals in this important area , " she said .
" in line with our desire to see greater participation in the development of law , we encourage everyone with an interest to consider the consultation paper and make their views known . "
the same issues are being looked at in england and wales .

the study , published in neurology , found that statins - normally taken to reduce heart disease risk - may cut the risk of dementia by half .
the five-year project examined 1,674 mexican americans aged 60 and over at heightened risk of dementia .
the alzheimer 's research trust said the research is " encouraging " .
a quarter of the patients took a statin , and in total 130 went on to develop dementia .
the jury is still out on how effective they are , but this study adds to growing evidence that they may have some benefits dr clive ballard alzheimer 's society once the researchers had taken account of other risk factors , including education , smoking , and diabetes , they calculated that those who took statins had an approximately 50 % lower risk of developing dementia .
the study comes hot on the heels of separate research which suggests that drugs to reduce blood pressure can also cut the risk of dementia .
it is estimated that 4 million people in england and wales alone currently take statins .
lead researcher professor mary haan , of the university of michigan , said : " the bottom line is that if a person takes statins over a course of about five to seven years , it reduces the risk of dementia by half , and that 's a really big change . "
statins help to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering levels of cholesterol which clog up the blood vessels .
it is thought that a poor supply of blood to the brain may be one factor which promotes the development of dementia .
therefore , if statins help keep the blood vessels healthy , and blood flowing freely to the brain , they may help protect against the disease .
however , it is still not clear exactly how statins work on the biochemical pathways involved in dementia .
professor haan said one possibility is that statins may help to reduce levels of the hormone insulin , which have also been implicated in the development of dementia .
' encouraging ' results rebecca wood , of the alzheimer 's research trust , described the research as " encouraging " .
however , she said : " people should not take statins unless medically advised to do as , as side-effects can be unpleasant .

the study comes hot on the heels of separate research which suggests that drugs to reduce blood pressure can also cut the risk of dementia .
it is estimated that 4 million people in england and wales alone currently take statins .
lead researcher professor mary haan , of the university of michigan , said : " the bottom line is that if a person takes statins over a course of about five to seven years , it reduces the risk of dementia by half , and that 's a really big change . "
statins help to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering levels of cholesterol which clog up the blood vessels .
it is thought that a poor supply of blood to the brain may be one factor which promotes the development of dementia .
therefore , if statins help keep the blood vessels healthy , and blood flowing freely to the brain , they may help protect against the disease .
however , it is still not clear exactly how statins work on the biochemical pathways involved in dementia .
professor haan said one possibility is that statins may help to reduce levels of the hormone insulin , which have also been implicated in the development of dementia .
' encouraging ' results rebecca wood , of the alzheimer 's research trust , described the research as " encouraging " .
however , she said : " people should not take statins unless medically advised to do as , as side-effects can be unpleasant .

dr clive ballard , of the alzheimer 's society , said statins were increasingly being touted as a potential cure for dementia .

he is to surrender his role in day-to-day governmental affairs and be guided by the pm , his spokesman has said .
the monarch - who took over from his father , tupou iv , in september 2006 - is being formally enthroned on friday .
the palace had long pledged democratic reforms , but progress has been slow and public dissatisfaction was growing , correspondents say .
george v , 60 , is making the changes to prepare the monarchy for 2010 , when most of the new parliament will be elected , said hon fielakepa , the lord chamberlain and royal spokesman .
" the sovereign of the only polynesian kingdom ... is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people , " he said .
last week , the government said the king had completed the sale of his ownership of state assets which had contributed to much of the royal family 's wealth .
tonga is one of a handful of countries in the world where the monarch has a hand in the daily running of government .
but pressure for change has been building in the south pacific nation .
unrest boiled over into riots in 2006 at a pro-democracy rally in the capital , nuku 'alofa , that left eight people dead and destroyed much of the city .

he is to surrender his role in day-to-day governmental affairs and be guided by the pm , his spokesman has said .
the monarch - who took over from his father , tupou iv , in september 2006 - is being formally enthroned on friday .
the palace had long pledged democratic reforms , but progress has been slow and public dissatisfaction was growing , correspondents say .
george v , 60 , is making the changes to prepare the monarchy for 2010 , when most of the new parliament will be elected , said hon fielakepa , the lord chamberlain and royal spokesman .
" the sovereign of the only polynesian kingdom ... is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people , " he said .
last week , the government said the king had completed the sale of his ownership of state assets which had contributed to much of the royal family 's wealth .
tonga is one of a handful of countries in the world where the monarch has a hand in the daily running of government .
but pressure for change has been building in the south pacific nation .
unrest boiled over into riots in 2006 at a pro-democracy rally in the capital , nuku 'alofa , that left eight people dead and destroyed much of the city .
george v 's coronation was delayed as a result .
