" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need these soldiers very soon as we need to hold onto certain areas , " said ramms .
" we need to create trust among the afghan population because we want to hand over this responsibility in 2010 , 2011 or 2012 to the afghan forces when they are prepared . " in other words , the forces that i am now lacking could delay the withdrawal of nato and isaf , " the nato-led mission to afghanistan , ramms added . police training lagging bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramms says the nato mission in afghanistan is hampered by a lack of troops ramms also emphasized the importance of the police training mission , which is currently led by the us .
police training had fallen behind military training by two to two and a half years , he said , adding that the us , which recently bolstered the mission with $ 3.6 billion and 2,800 instructors , had already done a lot to pick up the pace . " we recognized the important of the police too late , " said ramms . the general also said that establishing a strong corruption-free afghan military and police force was essential to create a positive rapport with the afghan people . " the key to success in fighting the taliban is with the local population , " he said , adding that local residents who trusted isaf would inform them of planned attacks . germany may boost troops nato currently has around 60,000 troops in afghanistan , but a resurgent taliban has gained ground over the past two years .
germany has fixed its participation in isaf at 3,500 troops , however parliament is due to reconsider the nature and size of germany 's involvement later this year . german defense minister franz-josef jung said on saturday that he supports deploying an additional 1,000 german soldiers to afghanistan . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german business confidence slumps to dramatic 2.5 year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economic crisis is causing continuing stress and strain in germany german business confidence slumped to a two-and-half year low in june , a key survey released monday said , amid growing global stagflation and interest rate fears . the closely-watched ifo business confidence index fell to 101.3 points this month from 103.5 points in may as a weak dollar , surging inflation , soaring oil prices and slowing growth led to a darkening mood in the boardrooms of europe 's biggest economy .
economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank is trying to out a positive spin on events instead of a previously projected 1.9 per cent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 per cent growth rate this year .
this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .
another rise in german inflation could help to result in consumer prices in the euro zone gaining ground again in june .

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .

" us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german business confidence slumps to dramatic 2.5 year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economic crisis is causing continuing stress and strain in germany german business confidence slumped to a two-and-half year low in june , a key survey released monday said , amid growing global stagflation and interest rate fears . the closely-watched ifo business confidence index fell to 101.3 points this month from 103.5 points in may as a weak dollar , surging inflation , soaring oil prices and slowing growth led to a darkening mood in the boardrooms of europe 's biggest economy .
economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .

this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .
kuwait and the united arab emirates similarly signaled their readiness to up production in the future . oil producers say production hike unnecessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah criticized speculators for the rise in oil prices other opec -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- members such as algeria and venezuela , however , rejected this idea , as did chakib khelil , opec president and algeria 's oil minister .
khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .
bodman similarly dismissed abdullah 's claim that higher prices are connected to speculation , stating that " there is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving future prices . " uk 's brown advocates nuclear as alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown called for 100 new nuclear power stations brown placed an emphasis on diplomacy as he called for a " new global deal " that would enable a " greater commonality of interest " between oil consumers and producers . he also underlined the need for more investments in nuclear and renewable energy , calling for the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants and an additional 700,000 wind turbines worldwide by the year 2050 . the price of a barrel of oil ten years ago was at ten us dollars . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .

the institution is involved in a large number of business deals between europe and iran . in a march resolution , the un security council had warned its members to be alert toward all iranian banks in order to prevent them from supporting problematic nuclear activities . twenty individuals and 15 organizations with connections to iran 's nuclear and weapons programs were also added to the eu 's visa-ban and asset-freeze lists .

solana presented a cooperation proposal on behalf of britain , china , france , germany , russia and the us , which involved offering iran technological incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program . the foreign policy chief said friday that he had not yet received a response from tehran , though top iranian nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said the possibility of iran suspending uranium enrichment had not been discussed with solana . earlier this month , us president george w. bush brought up the issues of sanctions against iran during the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia , as the us had been eagerly awaiting stricter action from the 27-member bloc . eu wants to continue talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana met with iran 's top nuclear negotiator earlier this month also on monday , the eu emphasized its interest in continuing diplomatic negotiations with tehran . although the deal presented by solana is dependent on iran fully halting its uranium enrichment program , the foreign policy chief has proposed a time of preliminary talks : tehran would agree not to set up new centrifuges , while the international community would not pile on additional sanctions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .
the package includes higher standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings as of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their trial began on monday , june 23 . in a scene filmed by closed-circuit security cameras on december 20 , 2007 and repeatedly broadcast on german television throughout the christmas holiday period , the assailants knocked an elderly man to the ground and kicked him .
he was critically injured , but recovered . the victim , 76 , a retired school principal , said he told the young men off for smoking inside a non-smoking underground station . both accused appeared in a munich young person 's court , because one defendant was under 18 at the time of the alleged crime .
he faces a maximum term of 10 years in jail .
the older accused faces a maximum sentence of life if the court treats him as an adult . state premier draws on attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch campaigned for tougher punishment for young criminals the assault in bavaria was seized on by roland koch , premier of the neighboring state of hesse , who was running for re-election , to suggest that violence worsened if the courts were too reluctant to jail teen youths for minor violence . koch and other center-right figures called for special youth jails , or boot camps , with a focus on arduous exercise and military-style discipline .
chancellor angela merkel voiced support for brief custodial sentences as a deterrent to juveniles . the issue did not save koch , whose vote share declined .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 23.06.2008 latin america may halt trade talks over eu immigration rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal treatment for illegals throughout the bloc a new eu law that calls for the swift deportation of illegal immigrants has been loudly criticized by latin america , which has threatened to halt trade talks as a result . in an effort to have illegal immigrants treated equally across the bloc , the european parliament has passed a controversial deportation law .
now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu agrees on rules to return immigrants european union diplomats have endorsed a deal brokered with the european parliament , limiting to six months the period over which illegal immigrants can be detained within the eu .
-lrb- 23.05.2008 -rrb- amnesty international criticizes eu 's immigration policy the human rights organization amnesty international denounced the european union 's policies on asylum-seekers , calling them a lottery for the right to stay in what it has described as fortress europe .
-lrb- 16.04.2008 -rrb- spain 's border surveillance system remains controversial the spanish government 's controversial high-tech border surveillance system to deter illegal immigration seems to be working .
but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem .

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "

we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de goalkeepers could be key in germany-turkey semi-final turkey may have stolen the show from germany when it comes to fighting spirit at euro 2008 , but the germans could still win their semi-final date because they appear to have the better goalkeeper .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "

" us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .

with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .

" us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german town first to require solar panels on new buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the face of rising energy prices , solar panels pay off in the long run marburg , a german college town of about 80,000 , has become the first in the country to make solar heating obligatory for newly built or renovated buildings .
the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good .

1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us report showed security failures " atomic weapons in germany are a holdover from the cold war .
they must go , ” guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition free democrat party , told the berliner zeitung .
' no security with atomic weapons ' germany should quickly look for a solution , together with the usa , he said , adding that such a withdrawal could also be the impetus for a new round of disarmament in europe .
green party head juergen trittin also called for the removal of nuclear weapons , saying that german chancellor angela merkel should reject germany 's role in a nuclear partnership .
gregor gysi , party leader of the left , told the paper that if the current government was strong enough , it would “ immediately demand the us to withdraw - and preferably destroy - the atomic weapons . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle disagree on the issue this would make germany more secure , he said , adding that the report shows that “ with atomic weapons , there is no security . ”
merkel 's party favors nuclear defense spd foreign affairs expert niels annen said the withdrawal would be a huge step toward nuclear disarmament .
but members of merkel 's ruling coalition party , the christian democratic union / christian socialist union , want to maintain their strategy of nuclear threat .
of course , the weapons should be stored according to the highest security standards , the cdu foreign affairs spokesman eckart von klaeden told the berliner zeitung .
" but we can not do without them , as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , “ he said .
“ they protect us , too . "
nuclear weaponry has to be part of german security policy , continued von klaeden .
“ we have to protect ourselves against being taken hostage someday from a country like iran , " he said .
report on ' nuclear security problem ' a summary of the report was released in february , but declassified details obtained by the federation of american scientists revealed " a much bigger nuclear security problem in europe " than was previously known , the group wrote on its web site .
as a consequence , the us military plans to withdraw its nuclear custodial unit from one base and possibly consolidate remaining sites into fewer bases .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us report showed security failures " atomic weapons in germany are a holdover from the cold war .
they must go , ” guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition free democrat party , told the berliner zeitung .
' no security with atomic weapons ' germany should quickly look for a solution , together with the usa , he said , adding that such a withdrawal could also be the impetus for a new round of disarmament in europe .
green party head juergen trittin also called for the removal of nuclear weapons , saying that german chancellor angela merkel should reject germany 's role in a nuclear partnership .
gregor gysi , party leader of the left , told the paper that if the current government was strong enough , it would “ immediately demand the us to withdraw - and preferably destroy - the atomic weapons . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle disagree on the issue this would make germany more secure , he said , adding that the report shows that “ with atomic weapons , there is no security . ”
merkel 's party favors nuclear defense spd foreign affairs expert niels annen said the withdrawal would be a huge step toward nuclear disarmament .
but members of merkel 's ruling coalition party , the christian democratic union / christian socialist union , want to maintain their strategy of nuclear threat .
of course , the weapons should be stored according to the highest security standards , the cdu foreign affairs spokesman eckart von klaeden told the berliner zeitung .
" but we can not do without them , as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , “ he said .
“ they protect us , too . "
nuclear weaponry has to be part of german security policy , continued von klaeden .
“ we have to protect ourselves against being taken hostage someday from a country like iran , " he said .
report on ' nuclear security problem ' a summary of the report was released in february , but declassified details obtained by the federation of american scientists revealed " a much bigger nuclear security problem in europe " than was previously known , the group wrote on its web site .
as a consequence , the us military plans to withdraw its nuclear custodial unit from one base and possibly consolidate remaining sites into fewer bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are nukes a cold war relic , or a necessity ?
the european bases in question are places where nuclear weapons are stored for possible use by the host country 's own aircraft .
us nuclear weapons are stored in underground vaults at bases in belgium , germany , holland , italy , turkey and the united kingdom , the federation said , mostly at us air force bases .

the institution is involved in a large number of business deals between europe and iran . in a march resolution , the un security council had warned its members to be alert toward all iranian banks in order to prevent them from supporting problematic nuclear activities . twenty individuals and 15 organizations with connections to iran 's nuclear and weapons programs were also added to the eu 's visa-ban and asset-freeze lists .

solana presented a cooperation proposal on behalf of britain , china , france , germany , russia and the us , which involved offering iran technological incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program . the foreign policy chief said friday that he had not yet received a response from tehran , though top iranian nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said the possibility of iran suspending uranium enrichment had not been discussed with solana . earlier this month , us president george w. bush brought up the issues of sanctions against iran during the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia , as the us had been eagerly awaiting stricter action from the 27-member bloc . eu wants to continue talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana met with iran 's top nuclear negotiator earlier this month also on monday , the eu emphasized its interest in continuing diplomatic negotiations with tehran . although the deal presented by solana is dependent on iran fully halting its uranium enrichment program , the foreign policy chief has proposed a time of preliminary talks : tehran would agree not to set up new centrifuges , while the international community would not pile on additional sanctions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dominant spain deserved win despite the effort of the italians , aragones ' young team deserved to go through , because they dominated possession from start to finish and created the better goal chances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german business confidence slumps to dramatic 2.5 year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economic crisis is causing continuing stress and strain in germany german business confidence slumped to a two-and-half year low in june , a key survey released monday said , amid growing global stagflation and interest rate fears . the closely-watched ifo business confidence index fell to 101.3 points this month from 103.5 points in may as a weak dollar , surging inflation , soaring oil prices and slowing growth led to a darkening mood in the boardrooms of europe 's biggest economy .
economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank is trying to out a positive spin on events instead of a previously projected 1.9 per cent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 per cent growth rate this year .
this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .
another rise in german inflation could help to result in consumer prices in the euro zone gaining ground again in june .
annual euro zone inflation climbed to a 16-year high of 3.7 per cent in may . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .

german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .
kuwait and the united arab emirates similarly signaled their readiness to up production in the future . oil producers say production hike unnecessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah criticized speculators for the rise in oil prices other opec -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- members such as algeria and venezuela , however , rejected this idea , as did chakib khelil , opec president and algeria 's oil minister .
khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .
bodman similarly dismissed abdullah 's claim that higher prices are connected to speculation , stating that " there is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving future prices . " uk 's brown advocates nuclear as alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown called for 100 new nuclear power stations brown placed an emphasis on diplomacy as he called for a " new global deal " that would enable a " greater commonality of interest " between oil consumers and producers . he also underlined the need for more investments in nuclear and renewable energy , calling for the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants and an additional 700,000 wind turbines worldwide by the year 2050 . the price of a barrel of oil ten years ago was at ten us dollars . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german business confidence slumps to dramatic 2.5 year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economic crisis is causing continuing stress and strain in germany german business confidence slumped to a two-and-half year low in june , a key survey released monday said , amid growing global stagflation and interest rate fears . the closely-watched ifo business confidence index fell to 101.3 points this month from 103.5 points in may as a weak dollar , surging inflation , soaring oil prices and slowing growth led to a darkening mood in the boardrooms of europe 's biggest economy .
economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank is trying to out a positive spin on events instead of a previously projected 1.9 per cent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 per cent growth rate this year .
this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .
another rise in german inflation could help to result in consumer prices in the euro zone gaining ground again in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 23.06.2008 latin america may halt trade talks over eu immigration rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal treatment for illegals throughout the bloc a new eu law that calls for the swift deportation of illegal immigrants has been loudly criticized by latin america , which has threatened to halt trade talks as a result . in an effort to have illegal immigrants treated equally across the bloc , the european parliament has passed a controversial deportation law .
now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the institution is involved in a large number of business deals between europe and iran . in a march resolution , the un security council had warned its members to be alert toward all iranian banks in order to prevent them from supporting problematic nuclear activities . twenty individuals and 15 organizations with connections to iran 's nuclear and weapons programs were also added to the eu 's visa-ban and asset-freeze lists .

while the international community suspects that iran is planning nuclear weapons , tehran has consistently denied this , saying its nuclear program is used for domestic energy purposes only . the sanctions , which had been in the pipeline since may , were stalled by eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's trip to iran earlier this month .
solana presented a cooperation proposal on behalf of britain , china , france , germany , russia and the us , which involved offering iran technological incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program . the foreign policy chief said friday that he had not yet received a response from tehran , though top iranian nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said the possibility of iran suspending uranium enrichment had not been discussed with solana . earlier this month , us president george w. bush brought up the issues of sanctions against iran during the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia , as the us had been eagerly awaiting stricter action from the 27-member bloc . eu wants to continue talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana met with iran 's top nuclear negotiator earlier this month also on monday , the eu emphasized its interest in continuing diplomatic negotiations with tehran . although the deal presented by solana is dependent on iran fully halting its uranium enrichment program , the foreign policy chief has proposed a time of preliminary talks : tehran would agree not to set up new centrifuges , while the international community would not pile on additional sanctions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .

this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .

economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .

this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .

" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german town first to require solar panels on new buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the face of rising energy prices , solar panels pay off in the long run marburg , a german college town of about 80,000 , has become the first in the country to make solar heating obligatory for newly built or renovated buildings .
the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .
the package includes higher standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings as of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .

the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .
the package includes higher standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings as of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sometimes you lose , but i think we can hold our heads up high because of how we performed on the pitch . "
dominant spain deserved win despite the effort of the italians , aragones ' young team deserved to go through , because they dominated possession from start to finish and created the better goal chances .

valencia strikers villa and david silva came close several times to breaking the tense deadlock for spain .

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us report showed security failures " atomic weapons in germany are a holdover from the cold war .
they must go , ” guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition free democrat party , told the berliner zeitung .
' no security with atomic weapons ' germany should quickly look for a solution , together with the usa , he said , adding that such a withdrawal could also be the impetus for a new round of disarmament in europe .
green party head juergen trittin also called for the removal of nuclear weapons , saying that german chancellor angela merkel should reject germany 's role in a nuclear partnership .
gregor gysi , party leader of the left , told the paper that if the current government was strong enough , it would “ immediately demand the us to withdraw - and preferably destroy - the atomic weapons . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle disagree on the issue this would make germany more secure , he said , adding that the report shows that “ with atomic weapons , there is no security . ”

of course , the weapons should be stored according to the highest security standards , the cdu foreign affairs spokesman eckart von klaeden told the berliner zeitung .
" but we can not do without them , as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , “ he said .

nuclear weaponry has to be part of german security policy , continued von klaeden .

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .

those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .
kuwait and the united arab emirates similarly signaled their readiness to up production in the future . oil producers say production hike unnecessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah criticized speculators for the rise in oil prices other opec -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- members such as algeria and venezuela , however , rejected this idea , as did chakib khelil , opec president and algeria 's oil minister .
khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .
bodman similarly dismissed abdullah 's claim that higher prices are connected to speculation , stating that " there is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving future prices . " uk 's brown advocates nuclear as alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown called for 100 new nuclear power stations brown placed an emphasis on diplomacy as he called for a " new global deal " that would enable a " greater commonality of interest " between oil consumers and producers . he also underlined the need for more investments in nuclear and renewable energy , calling for the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants and an additional 700,000 wind turbines worldwide by the year 2050 . the price of a barrel of oil ten years ago was at ten us dollars . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .
bodman similarly dismissed abdullah 's claim that higher prices are connected to speculation , stating that " there is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving future prices . " uk 's brown advocates nuclear as alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown called for 100 new nuclear power stations brown placed an emphasis on diplomacy as he called for a " new global deal " that would enable a " greater commonality of interest " between oil consumers and producers . he also underlined the need for more investments in nuclear and renewable energy , calling for the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants and an additional 700,000 wind turbines worldwide by the year 2050 . the price of a barrel of oil ten years ago was at ten us dollars . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .

coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .

his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .

he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .

he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .

of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .

respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 23.06.2008 latin america may halt trade talks over eu immigration rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants equal treatment for illegals throughout the bloc a new eu law that calls for the swift deportation of illegal immigrants has been loudly criticized by latin america , which has threatened to halt trade talks as a result . in an effort to have illegal immigrants treated equally across the bloc , the european parliament has passed a controversial deportation law .
now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu agrees on rules to return immigrants european union diplomats have endorsed a deal brokered with the european parliament , limiting to six months the period over which illegal immigrants can be detained within the eu .
-lrb- 23.05.2008 -rrb- amnesty international criticizes eu 's immigration policy the human rights organization amnesty international denounced the european union 's policies on asylum-seekers , calling them a lottery for the right to stay in what it has described as fortress europe .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german town first to require solar panels on new buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the face of rising energy prices , solar panels pay off in the long run marburg , a german college town of about 80,000 , has become the first in the country to make solar heating obligatory for newly built or renovated buildings .
the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .
the package includes higher standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings as of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "

" us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”

chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us report showed security failures " atomic weapons in germany are a holdover from the cold war .
they must go , ” guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition free democrat party , told the berliner zeitung .
' no security with atomic weapons ' germany should quickly look for a solution , together with the usa , he said , adding that such a withdrawal could also be the impetus for a new round of disarmament in europe .
green party head juergen trittin also called for the removal of nuclear weapons , saying that german chancellor angela merkel should reject germany 's role in a nuclear partnership .
gregor gysi , party leader of the left , told the paper that if the current government was strong enough , it would “ immediately demand the us to withdraw - and preferably destroy - the atomic weapons . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle disagree on the issue this would make germany more secure , he said , adding that the report shows that “ with atomic weapons , there is no security . ”
merkel 's party favors nuclear defense spd foreign affairs expert niels annen said the withdrawal would be a huge step toward nuclear disarmament .
but members of merkel 's ruling coalition party , the christian democratic union / christian socialist union , want to maintain their strategy of nuclear threat .
of course , the weapons should be stored according to the highest security standards , the cdu foreign affairs spokesman eckart von klaeden told the berliner zeitung .
" but we can not do without them , as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , “ he said .
“ they protect us , too . "
nuclear weaponry has to be part of german security policy , continued von klaeden .
“ we have to protect ourselves against being taken hostage someday from a country like iran , " he said .
report on ' nuclear security problem ' a summary of the report was released in february , but declassified details obtained by the federation of american scientists revealed " a much bigger nuclear security problem in europe " than was previously known , the group wrote on its web site .
as a consequence , the us military plans to withdraw its nuclear custodial unit from one base and possibly consolidate remaining sites into fewer bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are nukes a cold war relic , or a necessity ?
the european bases in question are places where nuclear weapons are stored for possible use by the host country 's own aircraft .
us nuclear weapons are stored in underground vaults at bases in belgium , germany , holland , italy , turkey and the united kingdom , the federation said , mostly at us air force bases .
belgium , germany , holland and italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases .
losing track of warheads the weapons at each of the national bases are under control of the us air force in peacetime but would , upon receipt of proper authority from the us national command authority , be handed over to the national air force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation 's own aircraft , the federation wrote .
the review was carried out after the us air force lost track of six nuclear warheads for more than a day last year as they were flown across the us .
the federation of american scientists is pushing for release of details of the report .
the review found that " host nation security at overseas nuclear-capable units varies from country to country in terms of personnel , facilities , and equipment , " the federation quoted the report as saying . there were security lapses in " support buildings , fencing , lighting , and security systems , " the report found . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .

economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank is trying to out a positive spin on events instead of a previously projected 1.9 per cent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 per cent growth rate this year .
this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us report showed security failures " atomic weapons in germany are a holdover from the cold war .
they must go , ” guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition free democrat party , told the berliner zeitung .
' no security with atomic weapons ' germany should quickly look for a solution , together with the usa , he said , adding that such a withdrawal could also be the impetus for a new round of disarmament in europe .
green party head juergen trittin also called for the removal of nuclear weapons , saying that german chancellor angela merkel should reject germany 's role in a nuclear partnership .
gregor gysi , party leader of the left , told the paper that if the current government was strong enough , it would “ immediately demand the us to withdraw - and preferably destroy - the atomic weapons . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle disagree on the issue this would make germany more secure , he said , adding that the report shows that “ with atomic weapons , there is no security . ”
merkel 's party favors nuclear defense spd foreign affairs expert niels annen said the withdrawal would be a huge step toward nuclear disarmament .
but members of merkel 's ruling coalition party , the christian democratic union / christian socialist union , want to maintain their strategy of nuclear threat .
of course , the weapons should be stored according to the highest security standards , the cdu foreign affairs spokesman eckart von klaeden told the berliner zeitung .
" but we can not do without them , as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , “ he said .
“ they protect us , too . "
nuclear weaponry has to be part of german security policy , continued von klaeden .
“ we have to protect ourselves against being taken hostage someday from a country like iran , " he said .
report on ' nuclear security problem ' a summary of the report was released in february , but declassified details obtained by the federation of american scientists revealed " a much bigger nuclear security problem in europe " than was previously known , the group wrote on its web site .
as a consequence , the us military plans to withdraw its nuclear custodial unit from one base and possibly consolidate remaining sites into fewer bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are nukes a cold war relic , or a necessity ?
the european bases in question are places where nuclear weapons are stored for possible use by the host country 's own aircraft .
us nuclear weapons are stored in underground vaults at bases in belgium , germany , holland , italy , turkey and the united kingdom , the federation said , mostly at us air force bases .
belgium , germany , holland and italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases .
losing track of warheads the weapons at each of the national bases are under control of the us air force in peacetime but would , upon receipt of proper authority from the us national command authority , be handed over to the national air force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation 's own aircraft , the federation wrote .
the review was carried out after the us air force lost track of six nuclear warheads for more than a day last year as they were flown across the us .
the federation of american scientists is pushing for release of details of the report .
the review found that " host nation security at overseas nuclear-capable units varies from country to country in terms of personnel , facilities , and equipment , " the federation quoted the report as saying . there were security lapses in " support buildings , fencing , lighting , and security systems , " the report found . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .
kuwait and the united arab emirates similarly signaled their readiness to up production in the future . oil producers say production hike unnecessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah criticized speculators for the rise in oil prices other opec -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- members such as algeria and venezuela , however , rejected this idea , as did chakib khelil , opec president and algeria 's oil minister .
khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .
bodman similarly dismissed abdullah 's claim that higher prices are connected to speculation , stating that " there is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving future prices . " uk 's brown advocates nuclear as alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown called for 100 new nuclear power stations brown placed an emphasis on diplomacy as he called for a " new global deal " that would enable a " greater commonality of interest " between oil consumers and producers . he also underlined the need for more investments in nuclear and renewable energy , calling for the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants and an additional 700,000 wind turbines worldwide by the year 2050 . the price of a barrel of oil ten years ago was at ten us dollars . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german business confidence slumps to dramatic 2.5 year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economic crisis is causing continuing stress and strain in germany german business confidence slumped to a two-and-half year low in june , a key survey released monday said , amid growing global stagflation and interest rate fears . the closely-watched ifo business confidence index fell to 101.3 points this month from 103.5 points in may as a weak dollar , surging inflation , soaring oil prices and slowing growth led to a darkening mood in the boardrooms of europe 's biggest economy .
economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank is trying to out a positive spin on events instead of a previously projected 1.9 per cent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 per cent growth rate this year .
this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .
another rise in german inflation could help to result in consumer prices in the euro zone gaining ground again in june .
annual euro zone inflation climbed to a 16-year high of 3.7 per cent in may . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .
kuwait and the united arab emirates similarly signaled their readiness to up production in the future . oil producers say production hike unnecessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah criticized speculators for the rise in oil prices other opec -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- members such as algeria and venezuela , however , rejected this idea , as did chakib khelil , opec president and algeria 's oil minister .
khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”

chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german business confidence slumps to dramatic 2.5 year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economic crisis is causing continuing stress and strain in germany german business confidence slumped to a two-and-half year low in june , a key survey released monday said , amid growing global stagflation and interest rate fears . the closely-watched ifo business confidence index fell to 101.3 points this month from 103.5 points in may as a weak dollar , surging inflation , soaring oil prices and slowing growth led to a darkening mood in the boardrooms of europe 's biggest economy .
economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .

this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german town first to require solar panels on new buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the face of rising energy prices , solar panels pay off in the long run marburg , a german college town of about 80,000 , has become the first in the country to make solar heating obligatory for newly built or renovated buildings .
the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .
the package includes higher standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings as of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .

economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .

this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .

the institution is involved in a large number of business deals between europe and iran . in a march resolution , the un security council had warned its members to be alert toward all iranian banks in order to prevent them from supporting problematic nuclear activities . twenty individuals and 15 organizations with connections to iran 's nuclear and weapons programs were also added to the eu 's visa-ban and asset-freeze lists .

while the international community suspects that iran is planning nuclear weapons , tehran has consistently denied this , saying its nuclear program is used for domestic energy purposes only . the sanctions , which had been in the pipeline since may , were stalled by eu foreign policy chief javier solana 's trip to iran earlier this month .
solana presented a cooperation proposal on behalf of britain , china , france , germany , russia and the us , which involved offering iran technological incentives in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program . the foreign policy chief said friday that he had not yet received a response from tehran , though top iranian nuclear negotiator saeed jalili said the possibility of iran suspending uranium enrichment had not been discussed with solana . earlier this month , us president george w. bush brought up the issues of sanctions against iran during the eu-us summit in brdo , slovenia , as the us had been eagerly awaiting stricter action from the 27-member bloc . eu wants to continue talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana met with iran 's top nuclear negotiator earlier this month also on monday , the eu emphasized its interest in continuing diplomatic negotiations with tehran . although the deal presented by solana is dependent on iran fully halting its uranium enrichment program , the foreign policy chief has proposed a time of preliminary talks : tehran would agree not to set up new centrifuges , while the international community would not pile on additional sanctions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german business confidence slumps to dramatic 2.5 year low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economic crisis is causing continuing stress and strain in germany german business confidence slumped to a two-and-half year low in june , a key survey released monday said , amid growing global stagflation and interest rate fears . the closely-watched ifo business confidence index fell to 101.3 points this month from 103.5 points in may as a weak dollar , surging inflation , soaring oil prices and slowing growth led to a darkening mood in the boardrooms of europe 's biggest economy .
economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .
" the firms have assessed their current business situation clearly less favorably than in the previous month , and they are more skeptical regarding the six-month outlook , " said ifo chief hans- werner sinn releasing the survey .
oil prices weighing heavily on economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the current hike in oil prices is having a knock-on effect " the sharp hike in oil prices is evidently becoming an increasing burden on the german economy , " he said with the nation 's executives growing pessimistic both about the current business climate and their expectations six months down the track .
german consumer concerns about the increasing economic uncertainty and a pickup in inflation chipping away at purchasing power are likely to lead to consumer confidence in the nation coming under pressure ; a survey to be released tuesday is forecast to say .
while the component of the ifo survey measuring the current business climate fell to 108.3 from 110.1 , the index 's gauge measuring expectations dropped to 94.7 from 97.2 .
in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank is trying to out a positive spin on events instead of a previously projected 1.9 per cent , germany 's central bank the bundesbank now expects the country to clock up a 2.25 per cent growth rate this year .
this came in the wake of a solid start to the year with the nation 's growth rate in the first three months of the year hitting almost a 12-year high of 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter .
the german economy grew by 2.5 per cent in 2007 .
but german growth is likely to loose ground in the run-up to the end of the year with the nation 's expansion rate tipped to slow in 2009 .
ecb planning nasty surprises the latest ifo survey , however , also comes as part of the buildup to next week 's ecb meeting with bank chief jean-claude trichet having placed investors on notice that the frankfurt-based bank was likely to hike rates by 25-basis points to ward off inflationary pressures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb could be preparing its first inflation hike in a year data to be released on thursday is forecast to show german inflation creeping up to 3.2 per cent in june , as a result increasing the chances of the ecb delivering its first rate hike in more than a year at its next meeting set down for july 3 .
another rise in german inflation could help to result in consumer prices in the euro zone gaining ground again in june .
annual euro zone inflation climbed to a 16-year high of 3.7 per cent in may . deutsche presse-agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economists had forecast that the monthly index drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute would slip to 102.3 points as a result , highlighting the dilemma facing the european central bank as it moves to screw down on inflation when growth is losing momentum .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the june ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a raft of major economic sentiment surveys , which are likely to point to a bleaker outlook taking shape across europe .

in the meantime , the ifo survey showed the mood in germany 's key manufacturing sector worsened significantly this month .
but while manufacturers responding to the survey said they expected their exports to hold up in the face of the strong euro , the ifo report points to them keeping a lid on business costs , consequently slowing the pace of employment .
positive export figures keep germany looking up powered by strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economic nations in asia and eastern europe , germany 's still-positive export outlook has helped to result in economists revising up their 2008 german growth outlooks .

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .
kuwait and the united arab emirates similarly signaled their readiness to up production in the future . oil producers say production hike unnecessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah criticized speculators for the rise in oil prices other opec -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- members such as algeria and venezuela , however , rejected this idea , as did chakib khelil , opec president and algeria 's oil minister .
khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .
bodman similarly dismissed abdullah 's claim that higher prices are connected to speculation , stating that " there is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving future prices . " uk 's brown advocates nuclear as alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown called for 100 new nuclear power stations brown placed an emphasis on diplomacy as he called for a " new global deal " that would enable a " greater commonality of interest " between oil consumers and producers . he also underlined the need for more investments in nuclear and renewable energy , calling for the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants and an additional 700,000 wind turbines worldwide by the year 2050 . the price of a barrel of oil ten years ago was at ten us dollars . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us report showed security failures " atomic weapons in germany are a holdover from the cold war .
they must go , ” guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition free democrat party , told the berliner zeitung .
' no security with atomic weapons ' germany should quickly look for a solution , together with the usa , he said , adding that such a withdrawal could also be the impetus for a new round of disarmament in europe .
green party head juergen trittin also called for the removal of nuclear weapons , saying that german chancellor angela merkel should reject germany 's role in a nuclear partnership .
gregor gysi , party leader of the left , told the paper that if the current government was strong enough , it would “ immediately demand the us to withdraw - and preferably destroy - the atomic weapons . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle disagree on the issue this would make germany more secure , he said , adding that the report shows that “ with atomic weapons , there is no security . ”
merkel 's party favors nuclear defense spd foreign affairs expert niels annen said the withdrawal would be a huge step toward nuclear disarmament .
but members of merkel 's ruling coalition party , the christian democratic union / christian socialist union , want to maintain their strategy of nuclear threat .
of course , the weapons should be stored according to the highest security standards , the cdu foreign affairs spokesman eckart von klaeden told the berliner zeitung .
" but we can not do without them , as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , “ he said .
“ they protect us , too . "
nuclear weaponry has to be part of german security policy , continued von klaeden .
“ we have to protect ourselves against being taken hostage someday from a country like iran , " he said .
report on ' nuclear security problem ' a summary of the report was released in february , but declassified details obtained by the federation of american scientists revealed " a much bigger nuclear security problem in europe " than was previously known , the group wrote on its web site .
as a consequence , the us military plans to withdraw its nuclear custodial unit from one base and possibly consolidate remaining sites into fewer bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are nukes a cold war relic , or a necessity ?
the european bases in question are places where nuclear weapons are stored for possible use by the host country 's own aircraft .
us nuclear weapons are stored in underground vaults at bases in belgium , germany , holland , italy , turkey and the united kingdom , the federation said , mostly at us air force bases .
belgium , germany , holland and italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases .
losing track of warheads the weapons at each of the national bases are under control of the us air force in peacetime but would , upon receipt of proper authority from the us national command authority , be handed over to the national air force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation 's own aircraft , the federation wrote .
the review was carried out after the us air force lost track of six nuclear warheads for more than a day last year as they were flown across the us .
the federation of american scientists is pushing for release of details of the report .
the review found that " host nation security at overseas nuclear-capable units varies from country to country in terms of personnel , facilities , and equipment , " the federation quoted the report as saying . there were security lapses in " support buildings , fencing , lighting , and security systems , " the report found . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.06.2008 german town first to require solar panels on new buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the face of rising energy prices , solar panels pay off in the long run marburg , a german college town of about 80,000 , has become the first in the country to make solar heating obligatory for newly built or renovated buildings .
the green bill has some residents and politicians up in arms . the law , passed on friday , june 20 by a coalition of social democrats and greens , has sparked a storm of criticism in the town of marburg in the state of hesse in western germany . " we are facing a green dictatorship but nobody dares to say anything , " said opposition politician hermann uchtmann . marburg 's green mayor franz kahle pointed out that installing the solar panels would cost around 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,800 -rrb- , but the price would be offset by energy savings over 15 years .
the german news weekly der spiegel , however , pointed out that the mayor is a tenant , not a home owner , and would personally enjoy the energy savings but not incur the cost of the panels himself . but regardless of who picks up the tab , some feel that the first step has to be made , even if it 's uncomfortable .
klaus vajen , a solar energy expert at the university of kassel said that " sometimes one has to twist consumers ' arm for their own good . " fines await those who do n't comply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about two thirds of marburg 's residents are students or academics slated to take effect on oct .
1 , the bill stipulates that the solar panels have to measure one square meter -lrb- 10 square feet -rrb- for every 20 square meters of the building 's surface area .
those who do n't comply with the new law will face fines starting at 1,000 euros - dramatically reduced from the initially proposed 15,000 euros . exceptions are to be made , however , for buildings that are principally heated from a district heating network , a combined heat and power generator , or a wood pellet oven . though marburg 's measures are the country 's most ambitious so far , it is not the first town to take legal steps toward saving energy and slashing carbon dioxide emissions .
the right-wing government in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg already requires new houses to meet 20 percent of their heating needs with renewable energy sources . in addition , the federal german cabinet recently approved a comprehensive climate plan aimed at reducing co2 emissions by nearly 40 percent by the year 2020 .
the package includes higher standards for energy efficiency in new and renovated buildings as of 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , some latin american countries , especially those with many immigrants in europe , are protesting the measures .
millions of latin americans live in europe , many from poor andean countries and war-weary colombia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules standardize detention and a travel ban the eu returns directive regulates the deportation of illegal immigrants to their country of origin .
under the law , an illegal immigrant will have two options : either " return " home or face " removal . "
the directive also allows clandestine migrants to be detained for up to 18 months , and face a five-year travel ban after being deported .
denouncing the ' hate directive ' rhetoric has been flying since the regulation came under discussion in early june .
but it reached new heights on saturday , june 21 , when ecuador 's president rafael correa warned that trade talks between the eu and the andean community could be suspended if the 27 member bloc pushes ahead with the new law .
" what do we have to talk about with a union of countries that criminalizes immigrants ? "
reuters news agency quoted him as telling a radio broadcast .
" it will be very hard to talk business and ignore human rights . "
correa , whose nation currently holds the andean community of nations ' rotating presidency , referred to the new law as the “ hate directive . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ecuador 's correa , right , met with merkel in may the trade bloc , made up of ecuador , peru , colombia and bolivia , launched trade and co-operation talks with the eu last year .
argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are also associate members as of 2005 .
chavez threatens to stop oil delivery latin america 's other trade bloc , mercosur , has also expressed misgivings .
the bloc 's secretary-general , carlos alvarez , has criticized the return directive for violating human rights .
the directive was also sharply criticized by the un and amnesty international .
meanwhile , last week , venezuelan president hugo chavez called the rules “ shameful ” and threatened to both cancel investment in , and disrupt oil exports to , the countries that enact the controversial immigration measures .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez has threatened to pull his oil from eu markets european leaders in turn said that chavez seems to have misunderstood the law .
at a two-day eu summit , spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said madrid was prepared to explain the new law “ so that the eu 's relationship with all latin american countries remains positive . "
" maybe we need to explain exactly to the president of venezuela what this directive -lrb- eu law -rrb- consists of , " zapatero said .
" there have been many interpretations of this directive ... that have nothing to do with what it really is . "
chavez has regularly issued conditional threats to halt crude shipments from venezuela - one of the world 's largest exporters of oil - although he has never followed through on a move that would hurt supplies at a time of record prices .
although venezuela only supplies some 400,000 barrels a day to europe , as opposed to the 1.4 million it delivers to the united states , european leaders have said the move is unwarranted .
question of economics the return directive has raised hackles not only because of possible human rights infringements , but because the remittances sent home by illegal workers to their poor countries of origin - for example ecuador and bolivia - are an important source of income there .
last year , immigrants in europe , the us and japan sent money back to their families in latin america and the caribbean amounting to just under € 43 billion -lrb- $ 66 billion , -rrb- the eu observer online newspaper said .
it is more than the region receives from foreign direct investment or development assistance combined .
some 15 percent of that comes from western europe , according to eu observer .
monies from spain amount to 36 percent of all global remittances to bolivia .
the leaders of those poor nations say that it makes no sense for europe to continue to send aid while cutting off remittances from immigrants . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is very special to be in the semi-finals .
we are the last team from the world cup semi-finals to be in the semi-finals here .
that speaks for consistency after the world cup , " loew told a news conference at the german euro camp in southern switzerland .
of the other world cup semi-finalists , holders italy lost to spain on sunday , france went out in the group stage while germany - a three-time world cup and euro champion - accounted for portugal .
loew praised his team for the big win last week , but also insisted : " the key is to keep our feet on the ground .
" we played a very good -lrb- quarter-final -rrb- match against portugal and must reach the same level again .
we have seen how strong the turks have become in the tournament . "
defender per mertesacker agreed : " the two tournaments show that we deserve to get to semis .
now we want to take the next step .
we prepared well each time and the team grew during the tournaments .
" playing at home in 2006 helped us .
we realized we could grow - we now profit from this .
nothing has changed .
-lrb- coach -rrb- juergen klinsmann has gone but his concept was continued , that 's why we deserve to be in the semi-finals again . "
respect for turkey but germany enjoy good odds the german camp had a lot of praise for the fighting spirit of the turks who managed to turn around the last three games with late goals .
but at the same time the team is also aware of a great chance to make sunday 's final in vienna against spain or russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack says the win over portugal has germany buzzing " turkey is tactically , technically and individually not better than us .
but it is unpredictable and no one of us will underestimate it ... it will be a tough task but we have a big chance to reach the final , " said michael ballack .
ballack said the impressive win has given his side a huge shot of confidence , especially since their shock 2-1 group stage defeat at the hands of croatia , and germany must take advantage of the injury-hit turks on wednesday .
" you always grow into the opponent and the task , " said ballack .
" portugal had been acting like the top favorites .
so if you can throw a team like them out of the tournament , it gives you enormous confidence .
it is exactly what we need at this stage of the tournament .
and we have to take our chance against turkey . "
but ballack is all too aware of turkey 's never-say-die spirit which has removed switzerland , the czech republic and croatia so far from the tournament in spectacularly late style .
coach loew knows a thing or two about the turkish spirit after working as manager of fenerbahce during the 1990s .
" i learnt very positive things for my life in turkey , " he said , praising the turks ' " amazing hospitality " as well as the identification with club and country in soccer .
he expressed his hope that germans and the large turkish community in germany will experience a great match at the fan zones in berlin and elsewhere .
fit frings present loew with selection dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a few wobbles , lehmann looks more assured but the coach did not want to reveal whether midfielder torsten frings would return into the lineup despite a cracked rib after he resumed full training on sunday night .
his presence would alter the german formation back from the successful 4-5-1 against portugal to the normally preferred 4-4-2 .
" frings is an important player .
there is possibility that he returns .
but there is also the possibility of ' never change a winning team . '
he is a fighter , i am happy he is available , " said loew .
" torsten trained completely normally , but with a protective bandage .
he said he had no major problems .
he will have to live with a nagging pain but as things stand he could play , yes . "
per mertesacker suggested that the 4-5-1 with thomas hitzlsperger and simon rolfes gave the germans a better defensive stability but agreed with loew and forward lukas podolski that it all depends on " how we present ourselves on the pitch . "
" we go into the game to win .
it does n't matter who is the favorite or who is suspended .
we have a good chance to make final if we play like against portugal , " said podolski .
lehmann ready to lay life on the line for final spot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings has recovered from a fractured rib but will he play ?
veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann said he was prepared to put his life on the line in wednesday 's euro 2008 semi-final against turkey .
the 38-year-old - who should win his 60th cap on wednesday - added that he would not make up his mind about his international future until later in the summer unlike his previous bitter rival oliver kahn , who hung up his gloves after the 2006 world cup .
" i am ready to give everything against turkey , even my life , " said the former arsenal guardian , who will play for bundesliga side vfb stuttgart next season after signing a one year contract .
lehmann , who replaced kahn as number one just prior to the 2006 world cup finals where germany finished third , said he would not make an impulsive decision over his international future .
" i am focusing on wednesday 's match .
afterwards if we get to sunday 's final , i do n't believe that i am going to announce what i am going to do just after it , " said lehmann , whose retention as number one by coach joachim loew for euro was criticized because he had not played enough first team football for arsenal last season .
" there is no pressure on me to do so . "
should lehmann announce his retirement , the number one spot would probably be between hannover 's rene adler or bayer leverkusen 's robert enke , who are backing him up in switzerland and austria . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de goalkeepers could be key in germany-turkey semi-final turkey may have stolen the show from germany when it comes to fighting spirit at euro 2008 , but the germans could still win their semi-final date because they appear to have the better goalkeeper .

the former scottish national team coach said that the european championships , the champions league and the world cup were the benchmarks for trends in the global game .
" what has been particularly interesting at this tournament is that a lot of late goals have been scored .
we have had seven goals in injury time and four in extra time , " he said .
" there have been a lot of fantastic matches of a very high quality .
i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with the current price of a barrel of oil now at a high of roughly 130 us dollars , he urged the summit participants to " rule out biased rumors " and to " reach the real causes for the increase in price . " saudi oil minister ali al – nuaimi also used the summit in the red sea city to quell any fears about depleted oil reserves , claiming that there is enough crude to last " many decades . "
with saudi oil output currently at 9.7 million barrels a day , abdullah vowed to increase oil production should this become necessary .
kuwait and the united arab emirates similarly signaled their readiness to up production in the future . oil producers say production hike unnecessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king abdullah criticized speculators for the rise in oil prices other opec -lrb- organization of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- members such as algeria and venezuela , however , rejected this idea , as did chakib khelil , opec president and algeria 's oil minister .
khelil insisted that increasing production is unnecessary , stating that the 13-nation opec would only consider a production increase at a meeting in september .
" we believe that the market is in equilibrium , " he said .
" the price is disconnected from fundamentals .
it is not a problem of supply . " glos calls for increase in production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos said the conference sent a clear message german economy minister michael glos was one leader who had positive feedback to offer regarding the summit .
" i view this conference as sending a clear signal to the oil market , which can contribute to an easing of the recent price developments , " he said . glos also agreed with abdullah that an increase in production is in order , claiming it would be " a strongly needed signal to the financial markets to not gamble any more on an increasing oil price . " us energy secretary samuel bodman echoed glos ' sentiments , warning that " in the absence of additional crude supply , for every one percent increase in demand we would expect a 20 percent increase in price in order to balance the market . " referring to the staggering oil prices as " the biggest of all three oil shocks " in recent decades , british prime minister gordon brown called for an analysis of production shortages , as well as the speculation aspect cited by king abdullah . brown however disagreed with the king 's assessment of the causes for rising prices , pointing to the economic scenario of " oil demand rising faster than supply " as the root of the problem .
bodman similarly dismissed abdullah 's claim that higher prices are connected to speculation , stating that " there is no evidence we can find that speculators are driving future prices . " uk 's brown advocates nuclear as alternative to oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown called for 100 new nuclear power stations brown placed an emphasis on diplomacy as he called for a " new global deal " that would enable a " greater commonality of interest " between oil consumers and producers . he also underlined the need for more investments in nuclear and renewable energy , calling for the construction of 100 new nuclear power plants and an additional 700,000 wind turbines worldwide by the year 2050 . the price of a barrel of oil ten years ago was at ten us dollars . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i think the late goals are an indication that coaches take late decisions to change the outcome of a game .
" these decisions have often had a very big influence on the game , " he said , adding that overall the standard of play had been very impressive . " the game has changed and this can be seen at the tournament .
a lot of goals have been scored from fast breaks .
there has been just one goal from a direct free-kick and even that took a deflection . "
roxburgh , who heads the nine-man uefa technical committee at the tournament , which on monday will release an all-star squad of 23 and announce the player of the tournament , said that he was particularly pleased with the attitude of the players towards each other .
the scotsman said that he was not sure whether it made much difference for players to be at the end of their season .
" that is always an issue and there is just one player left in the tournament who played in the champions league final -lrb- germany captain michael ballack -rrb- .
" the russian players are in the middle of their season and they are certainly very fit and have just been improving from game to game , " he added .
" clearly that they are in the middle of a season will be an advantage , but one ca n't really say how much of an advantage . "
arshavin the top man so far , says roxburgh roxburgh singled out russia 's andrei arshavin as one of the players of the tournament so far , even though he was suspended for the opening two matches .
" he was n't playing in the first two matches because of suspension but his introduction to the russian team has been like a sparkle of magic , " said roxburgh .
" he almost seems to have ignited them .
he has made a good team even better since he has come in .
the russian team is getting stronger and stronger as the competition goes on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arshavin 's goal against sweden was rated highly roxburgh also said arshavin 's goal against sweden , which helped russia to a 2-0 win and a place in the last eight , was one of the best at the tournament .
the former scotland boss also gave germany captain michael ballack a special mention for his performance against portugal .
" against portugal he was moved into what i call the ' free spirit role ' playing up front and suddenly - boom , " roxburgh said .
" he has been playing well in the championship but it seemed as though he came to life against portugal .
that was one of the best matches of the tournament too . "
uefa advisor not drawn on second-string team issue on the issue of coaches playing reserve sides for their final group games once their teams had already qualified , roxburgh was non-committal .
portugal , croatia , spain and the netherlands , who all won their group ahead of their last group game , rested most of their regulars in their final game .
of those , only spain are left in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holland effectively played their reserves against romania " there are positives and negatives to playing a second-string side .
on the one hand you would want to keep the momentum going , on the other you would want to rest players .
it is really up to each individual coach to see what work for his side . "
roxburgh said that the competition showed that teams were , on the one hand , dominated by efficiency , with no room for error , while on the other hand there has also been a lot of emphasis on solo play .
" it is about balance .
the top teams have both , both efficiency and quality , " he said , naming germany a prime example , " roxburgh said .
" you have them being clinical and efficient , but you also have a player like michael ballack , who played very well when he was given a free role . "
roxburgh praises co-hosts he complimented the two co-hosts austria and switzerland even though both teams went out in the group stage .
" they have been brilliant hosts .
in terms of football they had great passion and wonderful enthusiasm .
what they lacked was the finishing touch .
being knocked out has not really affected the tournament at all .
it was unfortunate and sad to see them go , but they have and are brilliant hosts , " said roxburgh .
meanwhile uefa admitted that ticketing problems had resulted in the stadiums not being filled for some of the matches at euro 2008 .
the director of communications and public affairs of europe 's governing football body , william gaillard , said that although all the games had been sold out , some seats had been empty .
" there were again some empty seats in sunday 's quarter-final clash between spain and italy .
this happens because teams that have received tickets have not returned them to us , " he said .
" when we were made aware of this , we tried to sell them , but could not manage . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's fans could face ticketing stress for the semis he added that as a result uefa had decided to restrict the ticket allocation to russia and italy for semi-final matches .
" obviously this will make no difference in the case of italy , as they have been knocked out , but russia will only receive 4,000 instead of 6,000 tickets for their semi-final game against spain . "
ticketing woes lead to discussions for semi-finals a spokesman for the euro organizing committee said that they would be speaking to the four semi-finalists to try to ensure that the ticketing problems which resulted in empty seats , would not be repeated .
" i do not , at this stage , want to give details how we are going to solve the problem , " wolfgang eichler said .
when tickets for euro were first offered earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of soccer fans failed to secure one , partly because the stadiums in switzerland and austria are so small .
the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- alone had 2,630,027 applications for tickets - more than double the amount of total tickets for the tournament .
gaillard said that uefa was considering a more flexible ticketing system for the 2012 euro in ukraine and poland . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she studies a very special habitat in the gulf of mexico .
there at depths of 3,000 meters large areas of the sea floor are covered with swathes of asphalt . this material originates in the petroleum deposits beneath the sea bed .
as hydrocarbons leak out through cracks in the sea floor , lighter components rise up to the water surface , the cooled , denser components remain on the seabed , leaving a solid mass of asphalt .
the result is a submarine landscape that resembles a cooled volcanic lava field .
inhospitable as it may seem , these formations are home to a unique community of organisms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us report showed security failures " atomic weapons in germany are a holdover from the cold war .
they must go , ” guido westerwelle , leader of the opposition free democrat party , told the berliner zeitung .
' no security with atomic weapons ' germany should quickly look for a solution , together with the usa , he said , adding that such a withdrawal could also be the impetus for a new round of disarmament in europe .
green party head juergen trittin also called for the removal of nuclear weapons , saying that german chancellor angela merkel should reject germany 's role in a nuclear partnership .
gregor gysi , party leader of the left , told the paper that if the current government was strong enough , it would “ immediately demand the us to withdraw - and preferably destroy - the atomic weapons . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle disagree on the issue this would make germany more secure , he said , adding that the report shows that “ with atomic weapons , there is no security . ”
merkel 's party favors nuclear defense spd foreign affairs expert niels annen said the withdrawal would be a huge step toward nuclear disarmament .
but members of merkel 's ruling coalition party , the christian democratic union / christian socialist union , want to maintain their strategy of nuclear threat .
of course , the weapons should be stored according to the highest security standards , the cdu foreign affairs spokesman eckart von klaeden told the berliner zeitung .
" but we can not do without them , as long as there are nuclear weapons in the world , “ he said .
“ they protect us , too . "
nuclear weaponry has to be part of german security policy , continued von klaeden .
“ we have to protect ourselves against being taken hostage someday from a country like iran , " he said .
report on ' nuclear security problem ' a summary of the report was released in february , but declassified details obtained by the federation of american scientists revealed " a much bigger nuclear security problem in europe " than was previously known , the group wrote on its web site .
as a consequence , the us military plans to withdraw its nuclear custodial unit from one base and possibly consolidate remaining sites into fewer bases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are nukes a cold war relic , or a necessity ?
the european bases in question are places where nuclear weapons are stored for possible use by the host country 's own aircraft .
us nuclear weapons are stored in underground vaults at bases in belgium , germany , holland , italy , turkey and the united kingdom , the federation said , mostly at us air force bases .
belgium , germany , holland and italy each have nuclear weapons at one of their national air bases .
losing track of warheads the weapons at each of the national bases are under control of the us air force in peacetime but would , upon receipt of proper authority from the us national command authority , be handed over to the national air force at the base in a war for delivery by the host nation 's own aircraft , the federation wrote .
the review was carried out after the us air force lost track of six nuclear warheads for more than a day last year as they were flown across the us .
the federation of american scientists is pushing for release of details of the report .
the review found that " host nation security at overseas nuclear-capable units varies from country to country in terms of personnel , facilities , and equipment , " the federation quoted the report as saying . there were security lapses in " support buildings , fencing , lighting , and security systems , " the report found . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about 80 % of the voters backed the measure in a referendum , several pollsters said .
the result is being seen as a rejection of president evo morales ' drive to redistribute wealth in south america 's poorest nation .
tarija is the fourth province to back greater autonomy .
the central government says the polls are illegal . "
a new bolivia must be built on a foundation of autonomy .
centralism has left a bad legacy " tarija governor mario cossio according to several exit polls , just over 80 % of those voting in tarija voted yes in the referendum .
however , pollsters say that most supporters of president morales did not vote .
some voters were deterred by unusually cold weather and a few minor outbreaks of violence , the bbc 's daniel schweimler says .
electoral officials have said final results are expected later this week .
autonomy backers celebrated in tarija 's capital after the exit polls were released .
" a new bolivia must be built on a foundation of autonomy .
centralism has left a bad legacy , " regional governor mario cossio told a crowd of supporters late on sunday .
earlier this year , the provinces of santa cruz , beni and pando also voted to distance themselves from the central government in la paz .
tarija 's referendum is another brick in the wall that is increasingly dividing the poorer , predominantly indigenous western half of bolivia from the gas and oil-rich eastern half , our correspondent says .
constitution reform president morales , who has more than two years left in office , faces a recall referendum on his leadership in august .
if successful in the ballot , mr morales says he wants to hold a public referendum on a draft constitution which has been awaiting approval since last year .
the constitution aims to enshrine reforms such as land redistribution to bolivia 's indigenous majority and sharing of wealth with the poorer western regions .
however , critics say it cedes too much control to the government in la paz .
mr morales 's opponents in the eastern states argue that his plans would unfairly privilege indigenous groups and would mean greater central control .
the proposals also include allowing the president to stand for re-election for another five-year term .

about 80 % of the voters backed the measure in a referendum , several pollsters said .
the result is being seen as a rejection of president evo morales ' drive to redistribute wealth in south america 's poorest nation .
tarija is the fourth province to back greater autonomy .
the central government says the polls are illegal .
a new bolivia must be built on a foundation of autonomy .
centralism has left a bad legacy tarija governor mario cossio according to several exit polls , just over 80 % of those voting in tarija voted yes in the referendum .
however , pollsters say that most supporters of president morales did not vote .
some voters were deterred by unusually cold weather and a few minor outbreaks of violence , the bbc 's daniel schweimler says .
electoral officials have said final results are expected later this week .
autonomy backers celebrated in tarija 's capital after the exit polls were released .
" a new bolivia must be built on a foundation of autonomy .
centralism has left a bad legacy , " regional governor mario cossio told a crowd of supporters late on sunday .
earlier this year , the provinces of santa cruz , beni and pando also voted to distance themselves from the central government in la paz .
tarija 's referendum is another brick in the wall that is increasingly dividing the poorer , predominantly indigenous western half of bolivia from the gas and oil-rich eastern half , our correspondent says .
constitution reform president morales , who has more than two years left in office , faces a recall referendum on his leadership in august .
the referendum will test whether mr morales still has the people 's support if successful in the ballot , mr morales says he wants to hold a public referendum on a draft constitution which has been awaiting approval since last year .
the constitution aims to enshrine reforms such as land redistribution to bolivia 's indigenous majority and sharing of wealth with the poorer western regions .
however , critics say it cedes too much control to the government in la paz .
mr morales 's opponents in the eastern states argue that his plans would unfairly privilege indigenous groups and would mean greater central control .
the proposals also include allowing the president to stand for re-election for another five-year term .

there is general agreement that the global body charged with conserving whales and regulating whaling does neither task very effectively .
a year-long diplomatic effort by the us has built bridges between the parties .
but there is still deep suspicion , and a fundamental divide over whether it is right to hunt whales at all .
it appears that japan , the head of the pro-hunting bloc , and most of its traditional opponents sense they have something to gain from trying to find common ground . "
the question is , do we accept the status quo and see more than 1,600 whales killed each year , or do we look and see is there a solution ? "
dr sue lieberman , wwf fin de guerre : whalers at peace ?
the hunting nations would gain legitimacy , while the prizes for the anti-whalers could include a smaller annual catch , the end of scientific whaling and greater regulation of the hunting that does take place .
if the spirit of harmony survives this week , another year of diplomacy is expected , aiming to agree a package of reforms by the next annual meeting .
" every party i 've talked to senses that the iwc can not continue on the path it 's on and i think that 's the first thing , to recognise that you have problems , " said william hogarth , the us whaling commissioner who , as iwc chair , has been leading the diplomacy .
" there 's no doubt that the only way to do this is to negotiate a package - everybody wins , nobody loses - but for the sake of the whales , we need to do this . "
compromise question what concerns some countries and some groups in the anti-whaling camp is that the package would almost certainly have to include a partial lifting of the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling , which to some is sacrosanct .
the legalities of whaling under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : objection - a country formally objects to the iwc moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
example : norway scientific - a nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any iwc member can do this .
example : japan aboriginal - iwc grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
example : alaskan inupiat " australia has n't come to this whaling commission to compromise at all , " australian environment minister peter garrett told reporters .
" we are strongly of the view that we do not want to see the commercial exploitation of whale populations . "
some conservation groups feel the same way .
but others believe that a deal might curb the annual whale catch which has risen steadily since the moratorium was established .
" the question is , do we accept the status quo and see more than 1,600 whales killed each year , or do we look and see if there is a solution ? " said sue lieberman , director of the global species programme for wwf international .
" we do n't like commercial whaling at all .
but if there could be a package that reduced what 's gong on right now , i think it would be wrong not at least to put it on the table and see what 's on offer ; but it has to be much better for whales than what we 've got right now . "
warmer climes another reason for doing a deal on hunting , in some people 's eyes , is that it would free the commission to look at other issues affecting whales .
the next whale to go extinct , for example , could be the north atlantic right whale .
only about 300 remain ; and although they were hunted in large numbers in previous centuries , the main threat to them now is being hit by ships .
guide to great whales recent reports have also highlighted the potential impacts of climate change .
" when you have species with restricted habitats , such as river dolphins or the vaquita in the gulf of california , as climate changes the animals have nowhere to go - they can not migrate out of trouble , " said mark simmonds , international director of science for the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- .
many of the ocean-going whales , meanwhile , depend on sea ice for their food .
the arctic ice is retreating fast in summertime , and computer models suggest the antarctic may see a reduction in decades to come .
" there is also growing evidence that we are seeing more disease events , and that those events that have large-scale population impacts are being modified by climate change , " added dr simmonds .
local needs as the meeting opens on monday at 1000 in santiago -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- , chilean president michelle bachelet will sign a bill seeking to establish a whale sanctuary in national waters .
the larger aim of the latin american bloc is to create a sanctuary for the entire south atlantic ocean .
greenland hunt ' too commercial ' but that will be a contentious issue ; and the choice before the latin americans is to push it and risk breaching the fragile peace , or to risk losing a certain amount of domestic face by not pushing it .
also likely to prove controversial as the meeting progresses is the request for greenlanders -lrb- who hunt under regulations permitting a subsistence catch -rrb- to be allowed an extra quota of humpback whales , which they do not currently hunt .
a report published last week showed that about 25 % of the meat was sold through commercial companies to supermarkets .
conservation groups say that shows the indigenous population 's " need " for whalemeat is open to question .
but the iwc 's scientists are likely to conclude that the quota is sustainable , and in that case the greenland request is likely to pass .

there is general agreement that the global body charged with conserving whales and regulating whaling does neither task very effectively .
a year-long diplomatic effort by the us has built bridges between the parties .
but there is still deep suspicion , and a fundamental divide over whether it is right to hunt whales at all .
it appears that japan , the head of the pro-hunting bloc , and most of its traditional opponents sense they have something to gain from trying to find common ground .
the question is , do we accept the status quo and see more than 1,600 whales killed each year , or do we look and see is there a solution ?
dr sue lieberman , wwf fin de guerre : whalers at peace ?
the hunting nations would gain legitimacy , while the prizes for the anti-whalers could include a smaller annual catch , the end of scientific whaling and greater regulation of the hunting that does take place .
if the spirit of harmony survives this week , another year of diplomacy is expected , aiming to agree a package of reforms by the next annual meeting .
" every party i 've talked to senses that the iwc can not continue on the path it 's on and i think that 's the first thing , to recognise that you have problems , " said william hogarth , the us whaling commissioner who , as iwc chair , has been leading the diplomacy .
" there 's no doubt that the only way to do this is to negotiate a package - everybody wins , nobody loses - but for the sake of the whales , we need to do this . "
compromise question what concerns some countries and some groups in the anti-whaling camp is that the package would almost certainly have to include a partial lifting of the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling , which to some is sacrosanct .
the legalities of whaling under the global moratorium on commercial whaling , hunting is conducted in three ways : objection - a country formally objects to the iwc moratorium , declaring itself exempt .
example : norway scientific - a nation issues unilateral ' scientific permits ' ; any iwc member can do this .
example : japan aboriginal - iwc grants permits to indigenous groups for subsistence food .
example : alaskan inupiat " australia has n't come to this whaling commission to compromise at all , " australian environment minister peter garrett told reporters .
" we are strongly of the view that we do not want to see the commercial exploitation of whale populations . "
some conservation groups feel the same way .
but others believe that a deal might curb the annual whale catch which has risen steadily since the moratorium was established .
" the question is , do we accept the status quo and see more than 1,600 whales killed each year , or do we look and see if there is a solution ? " said sue lieberman , director of the global species programme for wwf international .
" we do n't like commercial whaling at all .
but if there could be a package that reduced what 's gong on right now , i think it would be wrong not at least to put it on the table and see what 's on offer ; but it has to be much better for whales than what we 've got right now . "
warmer climes another reason for doing a deal on hunting , in some people 's eyes , is that it would free the commission to look at other issues affecting whales .
the next whale to go extinct , for example , could be the north atlantic right whale .
only about 300 remain ; and although they were hunted in large numbers in previous centuries , the main threat to them now is being hit by ships .
guide to great whales recent reports have also highlighted the potential impacts of climate change .
" when you have species with restricted habitats , such as river dolphins or the vaquita in the gulf of california , as climate changes the animals have nowhere to go - they can not migrate out of trouble , " said mark simmonds , international director of science for the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- .
many of the ocean-going whales , meanwhile , depend on sea ice for their food .
the arctic ice is retreating fast in summertime , and computer models suggest the antarctic may see a reduction in decades to come .
" there is also growing evidence that we are seeing more disease events , and that those events that have large-scale population impacts are being modified by climate change , " added dr simmonds .
local needs as the meeting opens on monday at 1000 in santiago -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- , chilean president michelle bachelet will sign a bill seeking to establish a whale sanctuary in national waters .
the larger aim of the latin american bloc is to create a sanctuary for the entire south atlantic ocean .
greenland hunt ' too commercial ' but that will be a contentious issue ; and the choice before the latin americans is to push it and risk breaching the fragile peace , or to risk losing a certain amount of domestic face by not pushing it .
also likely to prove controversial as the meeting progresses is the request for greenlanders -lrb- who hunt under regulations permitting a subsistence catch -rrb- to be allowed an extra quota of humpback whales , which they do not currently hunt .
a report published last week showed that about 25 % of the meat was sold through commercial companies to supermarkets .
conservation groups say that shows the indigenous population 's " need " for whalemeat is open to question .
but the iwc 's scientists are likely to conclude that the quota is sustainable , and in that case the greenland request is likely to pass .

advertisement all-wales new nurse uniform nurses across wales are to be issued with the same uniform so that patients can easily see who is in control and to help stop infection spreading .
health minister edwina hart is to announce plans to introduce an all-wales uniform within about two years .
" i want to ensure that anyone entering our hospitals in wales knows immediately who is a nurse and who is in charge , " she said .
a design will be sought which will minimise the risk of infection .
a working group of members of the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- , the union unison and the royal college of midwives was asked to investigate .
its members were told to look at ways of improving the patient experience and empowering ward sisters and charge nurses .
a new nationally-recognised uniform will be symbolic of the individual and the organisation health minister edwina hart but their investigation found patients confused because there is no consistent approach on hospital uniforms .
the group came up with recommendations which will mean different staff grades in every welsh nhs trust will have their own standard uniform to allow patients to distinguish who does what on the ward .
other recommendations to improve hygiene , cleanliness and the patient experience will be included in the working group 's report published this week .
ms hart said : " a new nationally-recognised uniform will be symbolic of the individual and the organisation .
" it will not only convey identity , but also a reassurance to patients and relatives and a sense of solidarity and pride among staff themselves . "
the new uniform will also be designed to reduce the risk of hospital infections spreading , ms hart added .
she said this would help meet the commitment to improve hospital cleanliness under the one wales document agreed by the labour and plaid cymru assembly government coalition .
daily change the working group has suggested the uniform be short-sleeved , and will have a side button or zip to avoid pulling stained or contaminated uniforms over the head and face when changing .
it would also be available on a daily change basis with access to extra changes if required .
richard jones , acting director of the rcn wales , said they saw the introduction of a single uniform as a " significant move " which would support nurses and enable patients to identify clearly the person delivering their care .
mr jones added : " an adequate supply of fit-for-purpose uniforms and onsite laundry facilities is a key means of combating healthcare associated infections such as mrsa and c.difficile.
" for these reasons we have been pleased to support the initiative and the wider empowering ward sisters and charge nurses project .
dave galligan , head of health at unison in wales , said the change to an all-wales uniform would be " particularly challenging but absolutely essential " .
" nurses should not need to be washing their own uniforms or indeed wearing them outside of the workplace , " he said .
" what is being proposed here will address both these issues and also help to reinforce the concept of an all-wales nhs in practice . "

advertisement all-wales new nurse uniform nurses across wales are to be issued with the same uniform so that patients can easily see who is in control and to help stop infection spreading .
health minister edwina hart is to announce plans to introduce an all-wales uniform within about two years .
" i want to ensure that anyone entering our hospitals in wales knows immediately who is a nurse and who is in charge , " she said .
a design will be sought which will minimise the risk of infection .
a working group of members of the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- , the union unison and the royal college of midwives was asked to investigate .
its members were told to look at ways of improving the patient experience and empowering ward sisters and charge nurses .
a new nationally-recognised uniform will be symbolic of the individual and the organisation health minister edwina hart but their investigation found patients confused because there is no consistent approach on hospital uniforms .
the group came up with recommendations which will mean different staff grades in every welsh nhs trust will have their own standard uniform to allow patients to distinguish who does what on the ward .
other recommendations to improve hygiene , cleanliness and the patient experience will be included in the working group 's report published this week .
ms hart said : " a new nationally-recognised uniform will be symbolic of the individual and the organisation .
" it will not only convey identity , but also a reassurance to patients and relatives and a sense of solidarity and pride among staff themselves . "
the new uniform will also be designed to reduce the risk of hospital infections spreading , ms hart added .
she said this would help meet the commitment to improve hospital cleanliness under the one wales document agreed by the labour and plaid cymru assembly government coalition .
daily change the working group has suggested the uniform be short-sleeved , and will have a side button or zip to avoid pulling stained or contaminated uniforms over the head and face when changing .
it would also be available on a daily change basis with access to extra changes if required .
richard jones , acting director of the rcn wales , said they saw the introduction of a single uniform as a " significant move " which would support nurses and enable patients to identify clearly the person delivering their care .
mr jones added : " an adequate supply of fit-for-purpose uniforms and onsite laundry facilities is a key means of combating healthcare associated infections such as mrsa and c.difficile.
" for these reasons we have been pleased to support the initiative and the wider empowering ward sisters and charge nurses project .
dave galligan , head of health at unison in wales , said the change to an all-wales uniform would be " particularly challenging but absolutely essential " .
" nurses should not need to be washing their own uniforms or indeed wearing them outside of the workplace , " he said .
" what is being proposed here will address both these issues and also help to reinforce the concept of an all-wales nhs in practice . "

eric and viola are among the estimated 375,000 expatriates who have retired to europe and seen the value of their uk pension plummet because of the soaring value of the euro .

by simon atkinson business reporter , bbc news , costa blanca , spain with a copy of the daily mail on the cafe table , eric summers orders a white coffee for himself and a tonic water for wife viola - in fluent spanish .
a late-morning drink on the pavement cafes of torrevieja has been a way of life since the couple moved to the costa blanca about nine years ago .
but in recent months , like many others , they have been more careful about watching the pennies , or at least the euro cents .
eric and viola are among the estimated 375,000 expatriates who have retired to europe and seen the value of their uk pension plummet because of the soaring value of the euro .
many state pensions , paid in sterling , are now worth between £ 50 and £ 80 less a month after the exchange rate sank earlier this year .
" you definitely notice it , " says eric , 78 , folding his newspaper .
" this time last year my british pension got me 750 euros a month - now it 's about 670 euros . "
better off they are not pleading poverty but their sinking incomes have been compounded by problems in spain that are all too familiar to their family back home - inflation and a struggling property market like in the uk - spaniards and expats who have made their homes here have seen the cost of filling a supermarket trolley rise sharply while on the petrol station forecourt , the price of fuel is soaring .
eric and viola say their weekly shopping bill has leapt from between 30 and 40 euros , to at least 60 euros .
" all the prices have gone up , but even though things have got more expensive , we 're still much better off than we would be in england , " eric adds .
" if we were living there we 'd have to be on benefits . "
and with day after day of sunshine , it is easy to see how moving abroad - and staying there - is not a decision purely driven by economics .
" the quality of life here is so much better , " says eric .
" of course there 's the weather , but the hospitals are tremendous and it 's a very cultural place too - lots of concerts and shows .
we love it . "
language barrier on torrevieja 's newly repaved promenade , the chalk board outside st jeremi 's traditional irish abbey pub advertises guinness and an all day english breakfast .

and those on fixed uk incomes - such as pensions - have also seen the strong euro bite deep into money they bring into europe .
we speak to some of those who have made a home on the costa blanca about their concerns about their financial situation and the impact on their lifestyle .

my raf and british aerospace pensions are paid in pounds in the uk .
transferring the same amount of money into euros now gives us about 18 % less than a few months ago .
spain is no longer a cheap option for us .
in real terms our bills - from electricity and water to the typical weekly supermarket shop - have risen considerably .

it 's partly for financial reasons .
with the green fees and all other costs it was eating into too much of our income . "
audrey and allan sinclair , 65 & 70 , originally from county durham " we enjoy our life here - especially the wonderful weather and great social life .
we would n't say that we 're struggling , but we really do notice a big difference .
at the moment , for every £ 1,000 gbp we transfer from the uk we are losing 200 euros -lrb- £ 157 -rrb- .
instead of eating out three times a week it 's just once or twice .
we have to start thinking whether we can really justify paying 50 to 70 euros for this meal out for the two of us .
when we do go out , we really notice how quiet the restaurants are .
i eat english here anyway .
i do n't like spanish food and never will so expect to pay more if we go to the english butchers and buy the imported food .
but there 's nothing you can do about it apart from be careful about what you spend we 've always said that we intend to end our days in england , but i 'd worry about not being able to sell the house .

astrella newman , originally from essex " i worked in a bank and my husband was in the metropolitan police .
his parents have a place here and we moved out for a change of lifestyle .
but if i had known then what i know now i might have stayed .
it 's a lovely place to live if you have got money but to make a living is very , very hard .
what we are earning here between us is what i was earning on my own working part time in the uk .
i have a full-time job in a clothes shop but lots of our friends are doing two or three part-time jobs .
we think about going back , but property prices in england are so high that we 'd never be able to afford anything like what we used to have .
the property market here is struggling .
we did n't buy an expensive place but we 'd be struggling to make back what we paid .
our options have got narrower .

the people are lovely but the authorities can be difficult . "

murli deora said some " minor problems " over the pipeline had been sorted out .
the pipeline will transport gas from iran to india through pakistan , and is seen as crucial to indian energy needs .
analysts say the pipeline could contribute to regional security as iran , pakistan and india would depend on each other more .
a deal has been stalled by disputes over transit fees and security issues .
mr deora , who attended a meeting of leading oil exporting countries in saudi arabia , told an indian news channel that the agreement to construct the pipeline would be signed " very soon " .
" there were ... some issues with pakistan that have been taken care of , " he said .
in april , iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , had told the indian prime minister , manmohan singh , that all obstacles holding up the long-delayed project would be resolved within 45 days .
the 2,600-km -lrb- 1,620-mile -rrb- pipeline would initially transport 60 million cubic metres of gas -lrb- 2.2bn cubic feet -rrb- a day .
the indian government has said the project is feasible , but needs to be financially viable with assured supplies .

the australian licensed aircraft engineers association -lrb- alaea -rrb- last week announced action in five major cities after failing to agree a pay deal .
the alaea had demanded a 5 % wage rise for 1,500 engineers , but the airline has offered 3 % .
the wage demands come as qantas is being squeezed by high fuel costs .
the strikes currently affect only domestic australian flights .
turbulent times qantas executive general manager for people kevin brown said that the airline had a " range of contingencies " to deal with the disruptions and that affected passengers would be placed on other flights .
the dispute is expected to continue as union leaders argue that qantas chiefs have shown no flexibility in meeting their demands .
qantas , like many airlines , is struggling to deal with a consumer downturn and surging fuel prices .
the firm has already announced a pay freeze for senior bosses and cancelled flights on key routes .
last month , a two-day strike grounded 17 qantas flights .
