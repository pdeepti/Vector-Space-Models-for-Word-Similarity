11 , carrying blue eu balloons and pro-european banners to urge their leaders to continue serbia 's process of integration into the european union . they chanted anti-kostunica slogans , demanded the government and parliament be allowed to continue their work and called for the immediate signing of an eu pact , which was originally intended to be agreed on last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers said they do n't want only the status of kosovo to determine serbia 's future " down with kostunica , the new milosevic , " some shouted in reference to the late autocratic leader slobodan milosevic , ousted in a popular uprising in 2000 as the protests continued despite plummeting temperatures and icy winds . last week kostunica blocked a cabinet meeting , fearing his coalition partners would approve the deal with the eu that he believes would be the first step to the independence of kosovo .

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan .

now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .
a 25-year-old man named salih s. from the central state of hesse vanished after leaving behind a letter to his family , saying that he would join the jihad . a 28-year-old man called cüney c. from bavaria cleared out his apartment and headed for pakistan , where german officials apparently lost track of him .
according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german officials fear that at least four islamists have left germany for terror training in camps along the afghan-pakistani border , according to a news report .
now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .

according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .

" assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .

its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .

" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .

nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 , carrying blue eu balloons and pro-european banners to urge their leaders to continue serbia 's process of integration into the european union . they chanted anti-kostunica slogans , demanded the government and parliament be allowed to continue their work and called for the immediate signing of an eu pact , which was originally intended to be agreed on last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers said they do n't want only the status of kosovo to determine serbia 's future " down with kostunica , the new milosevic , " some shouted in reference to the late autocratic leader slobodan milosevic , ousted in a popular uprising in 2000 as the protests continued despite plummeting temperatures and icy winds . last week kostunica blocked a cabinet meeting , fearing his coalition partners would approve the deal with the eu that he believes would be the first step to the independence of kosovo .
the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .

" whatever the solution for kosovo , it can not and does not have to stop our integration with the eu , " said viktor rajds , a 47-year-old economist taking part in the protest . " we are protesting against kostunica , " said a student who only identified herself as dijana .
" he would like to destroy everything because of kosovo , when there are things much more important , such as a better life , which are not possible without the eu .

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .
while in germany , olmert will also meet with german president horst köhler , parliamentary representatives and leaders of the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .
while in germany , olmert will also meet with german president horst köhler , parliamentary representatives and leaders of the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .
while in germany , olmert will also meet with german president horst köhler , parliamentary representatives and leaders of the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german officials fear that at least four islamists have left germany for terror training in camps along the afghan-pakistani border , according to a news report .
now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .
a 25-year-old man named salih s. from the central state of hesse vanished after leaving behind a letter to his family , saying that he would join the jihad . a 28-year-old man called cüney c. from bavaria cleared out his apartment and headed for pakistan , where german officials apparently lost track of him .
according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

on sylt , you have to go swimming every day - no matter what the weather 's like .
the best place to swim is called puan klent and there 's a great beach there .

i take off my windbreaker and dive into the water , which is always very clean .

when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .

she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

click on the link below to tell us about your trip . nikolai ivanov , 21 , is a student from st. petersburg , russia . my favorite destination in germany : the island of sylt in north frisia my preferred accommodation : youth hostels a perfect day on sylt : it 's a beautiful summer day , but i still put on a windbreaker before i go out - not because it 's supposed to rain , but because there 's a constant stormy wind on the island , even in the summer .
on sylt , you have to go swimming every day - no matter what the weather 's like .
the best place to swim is called puan klent and there 's a great beach there .
every time i stand at the water , the same thing happens : it 's rather chilly , it 's windy and the waves are big .
i have to hurry .
i take off my windbreaker and dive into the water , which is always very clean .
it 's an unforgettable feeling ! after my swim , i go over to the other side of the island - to the wadden sea mudflats .
people say that the mud from the wadden sea has a healing effect .
wading through it is fun !
in the evening , i enjoy drinking a cup of coffee in a cozy beach cafe in the village hörnum - next to the famous lighthouse . i tend to spend my money on : postcards , souvenirs , food and drink . my tip : do n't just stick to typical tourist places .
in every city or region , try to find something new - old ruins off the beaten path perhaps , or simply a pub where the locals gather .

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

11 , carrying blue eu balloons and pro-european banners to urge their leaders to continue serbia 's process of integration into the european union . they chanted anti-kostunica slogans , demanded the government and parliament be allowed to continue their work and called for the immediate signing of an eu pact , which was originally intended to be agreed on last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers said they do n't want only the status of kosovo to determine serbia 's future " down with kostunica , the new milosevic , " some shouted in reference to the late autocratic leader slobodan milosevic , ousted in a popular uprising in 2000 as the protests continued despite plummeting temperatures and icy winds . last week kostunica blocked a cabinet meeting , fearing his coalition partners would approve the deal with the eu that he believes would be the first step to the independence of kosovo .
the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .

" he would like to destroy everything because of kosovo , when there are things much more important , such as a better life , which are not possible without the eu .

our fashion , our music even our food can be found in any country in the world .
but how do people know what everything is if they do n't understand the language ? one of the most difficult things about living in a foreign country is getting to know what you 're actually buying in the supermarket .
if the products do n't feature any images then it 's usually anyone 's guess what it actually is , especially if the language in which the ingredients are written is a completely alien one . these risks are multiplied in a globalized world .
your own supermarket , filled with recognizable products and brands , have been infiltrated by foreign goods .
luckily , they are usually arranged on the shelves beside familiar products that give you some indication of whether you should eat the unknown product , rub it on you body or clean your toilet with it . the absences of such supermarket-shelf context , however , spilled out onto the streets of germany in last week 's carnival festivities .
one incident led the german police to issue a warning to the public about the dangers of eating shower gel . new danger to be added to list of carnival risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german shower gel : not to be taken internally it appears that during the procession in lampertheim , south of frankfurt , the traditional practice of throwing free treats to the watching crowds included a new risk .
common complaints during carnival often include eye damage from flying sweets and injuries sustained while fighting for candy but poisoning from eating italian shower gel is a new and unusual one - even by german carnival standards . an unidentified victim , who suffered burning sensations in the mouth and throat after eating the snack , which he thought was a dairy product , was unable to read any of the italian words on the label of the free gift except the fragrance description : " yoghurt . " police could not confirm whether anyone else had mistaken the soap for food . many gifts thrown to the masses during the late-winter festivities are low-priced turkish and southern european brands that are not on sale internationally and have no translations on the packaging .
most product safety laws only apply to goods on sale , not hand-outs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .

merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .

11 , carrying blue eu balloons and pro-european banners to urge their leaders to continue serbia 's process of integration into the european union . they chanted anti-kostunica slogans , demanded the government and parliament be allowed to continue their work and called for the immediate signing of an eu pact , which was originally intended to be agreed on last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers said they do n't want only the status of kosovo to determine serbia 's future " down with kostunica , the new milosevic , " some shouted in reference to the late autocratic leader slobodan milosevic , ousted in a popular uprising in 2000 as the protests continued despite plummeting temperatures and icy winds . last week kostunica blocked a cabinet meeting , fearing his coalition partners would approve the deal with the eu that he believes would be the first step to the independence of kosovo .
the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .
the request has so far been refused by the official , a supporter of pro-western president boris tadic , responsible for calling emergency sessions of parliament . students call for action on eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationalist graffiti reads : " never eu " the student protestors marched towards the serbian government building , led by a band of noisy drummers , where speakers urged the government to push for serbia 's membership of the eu regardless of what happens to the breakaway kosovo province . " whatever the solution for kosovo , it can not and does not have to stop our integration with the eu , " said viktor rajds , a 47-year-old economist taking part in the protest . " we are protesting against kostunica , " said a student who only identified herself as dijana .
" he would like to destroy everything because of kosovo , when there are things much more important , such as a better life , which are not possible without the eu . " after presenting their demands to the government , student union leader simon simonovic told the demonstrators to give the authorities time to see whether their requests will be met . protestors pledge to continue campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic supports serbia 's route to eu membership " young people want to join the eu and there is no compromise for this , " said simonovic .
" if the authorities do not want to take the way of european integration without compromise , we will return the next weeks with radical requests and much more . " last month , brussels offered belgrade the interim deal on political dialogue , free trade , visa relaxation and educational cooperation in place of a wider rapprochement accord . tadic , who opposes kosovo 's independence but not at the cost of serbia 's eu integration , was re-elected on feb .

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .
while in germany , olmert will also meet with german president horst köhler , parliamentary representatives and leaders of the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .

its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .

its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

11 , carrying blue eu balloons and pro-european banners to urge their leaders to continue serbia 's process of integration into the european union . they chanted anti-kostunica slogans , demanded the government and parliament be allowed to continue their work and called for the immediate signing of an eu pact , which was originally intended to be agreed on last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers said they do n't want only the status of kosovo to determine serbia 's future " down with kostunica , the new milosevic , " some shouted in reference to the late autocratic leader slobodan milosevic , ousted in a popular uprising in 2000 as the protests continued despite plummeting temperatures and icy winds . last week kostunica blocked a cabinet meeting , fearing his coalition partners would approve the deal with the eu that he believes would be the first step to the independence of kosovo .
the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .
the request has so far been refused by the official , a supporter of pro-western president boris tadic , responsible for calling emergency sessions of parliament . students call for action on eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationalist graffiti reads : " never eu " the student protestors marched towards the serbian government building , led by a band of noisy drummers , where speakers urged the government to push for serbia 's membership of the eu regardless of what happens to the breakaway kosovo province . " whatever the solution for kosovo , it can not and does not have to stop our integration with the eu , " said viktor rajds , a 47-year-old economist taking part in the protest . " we are protesting against kostunica , " said a student who only identified herself as dijana .
" he would like to destroy everything because of kosovo , when there are things much more important , such as a better life , which are not possible without the eu . " after presenting their demands to the government , student union leader simon simonovic told the demonstrators to give the authorities time to see whether their requests will be met . protestors pledge to continue campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic supports serbia 's route to eu membership " young people want to join the eu and there is no compromise for this , " said simonovic .
" if the authorities do not want to take the way of european integration without compromise , we will return the next weeks with radical requests and much more . " last month , brussels offered belgrade the interim deal on political dialogue , free trade , visa relaxation and educational cooperation in place of a wider rapprochement accord . tadic , who opposes kosovo 's independence but not at the cost of serbia 's eu integration , was re-elected on feb .

now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .

according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german officials fear that at least four islamists have left germany for terror training in camps along the afghan-pakistani border , according to a news report .
now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .
a 25-year-old man named salih s. from the central state of hesse vanished after leaving behind a letter to his family , saying that he would join the jihad . a 28-year-old man called cüney c. from bavaria cleared out his apartment and headed for pakistan , where german officials apparently lost track of him .
according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euromillions already joins nine countries in a scheme another collective , euromillions , a scheme set up by lottery companies francaise des jeux in france , loterias y apuestas del estado in spain and camelot in britain , started in early 2004 .
by the end of that year , austria , belgium , ireland , luxembourg , portugal and switzerland had joined the three founding nations .
unlike viking lottery , all prizes are of the same amount in each country .
it is unclear at this time whether the proposed new lottery would incorporate or replace euromillions or if any of the countries currently involved in euromillions would be involved . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .

sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .

merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan .

our fashion , our music even our food can be found in any country in the world .
but how do people know what everything is if they do n't understand the language ? one of the most difficult things about living in a foreign country is getting to know what you 're actually buying in the supermarket .
if the products do n't feature any images then it 's usually anyone 's guess what it actually is , especially if the language in which the ingredients are written is a completely alien one . these risks are multiplied in a globalized world .
your own supermarket , filled with recognizable products and brands , have been infiltrated by foreign goods .
luckily , they are usually arranged on the shelves beside familiar products that give you some indication of whether you should eat the unknown product , rub it on you body or clean your toilet with it . the absences of such supermarket-shelf context , however , spilled out onto the streets of germany in last week 's carnival festivities .
one incident led the german police to issue a warning to the public about the dangers of eating shower gel . new danger to be added to list of carnival risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german shower gel : not to be taken internally it appears that during the procession in lampertheim , south of frankfurt , the traditional practice of throwing free treats to the watching crowds included a new risk .
common complaints during carnival often include eye damage from flying sweets and injuries sustained while fighting for candy but poisoning from eating italian shower gel is a new and unusual one - even by german carnival standards . an unidentified victim , who suffered burning sensations in the mouth and throat after eating the snack , which he thought was a dairy product , was unable to read any of the italian words on the label of the free gift except the fragrance description : " yoghurt . " police could not confirm whether anyone else had mistaken the soap for food . many gifts thrown to the masses during the late-winter festivities are low-priced turkish and southern european brands that are not on sale internationally and have no translations on the packaging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .
while in germany , olmert will also meet with german president horst köhler , parliamentary representatives and leaders of the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .

they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .
while in germany , olmert will also meet with german president horst köhler , parliamentary representatives and leaders of the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german officials fear that at least four islamists have left germany for terror training in camps along the afghan-pakistani border , according to a news report .
now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .
a 25-year-old man named salih s. from the central state of hesse vanished after leaving behind a letter to his family , saying that he would join the jihad . a 28-year-old man called cüney c. from bavaria cleared out his apartment and headed for pakistan , where german officials apparently lost track of him .
according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euromillions already joins nine countries in a scheme another collective , euromillions , a scheme set up by lottery companies francaise des jeux in france , loterias y apuestas del estado in spain and camelot in britain , started in early 2004 .
by the end of that year , austria , belgium , ireland , luxembourg , portugal and switzerland had joined the three founding nations .
unlike viking lottery , all prizes are of the same amount in each country .
it is unclear at this time whether the proposed new lottery would incorporate or replace euromillions or if any of the countries currently involved in euromillions would be involved . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euromillions already joins nine countries in a scheme another collective , euromillions , a scheme set up by lottery companies francaise des jeux in france , loterias y apuestas del estado in spain and camelot in britain , started in early 2004 .
by the end of that year , austria , belgium , ireland , luxembourg , portugal and switzerland had joined the three founding nations .
unlike viking lottery , all prizes are of the same amount in each country .
it is unclear at this time whether the proposed new lottery would incorporate or replace euromillions or if any of the countries currently involved in euromillions would be involved . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 11.02.2008 german chancellor rejects turkish view on integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel disagreed with some of erdogan 's comments on educating turks in germany turkish prime minister erdogan called on his compatriots living in germany not to give up their ethnicity .
chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

11 , carrying blue eu balloons and pro-european banners to urge their leaders to continue serbia 's process of integration into the european union . they chanted anti-kostunica slogans , demanded the government and parliament be allowed to continue their work and called for the immediate signing of an eu pact , which was originally intended to be agreed on last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers said they do n't want only the status of kosovo to determine serbia 's future " down with kostunica , the new milosevic , " some shouted in reference to the late autocratic leader slobodan milosevic , ousted in a popular uprising in 2000 as the protests continued despite plummeting temperatures and icy winds . last week kostunica blocked a cabinet meeting , fearing his coalition partners would approve the deal with the eu that he believes would be the first step to the independence of kosovo .
the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .
the request has so far been refused by the official , a supporter of pro-western president boris tadic , responsible for calling emergency sessions of parliament . students call for action on eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationalist graffiti reads : " never eu " the student protestors marched towards the serbian government building , led by a band of noisy drummers , where speakers urged the government to push for serbia 's membership of the eu regardless of what happens to the breakaway kosovo province . " whatever the solution for kosovo , it can not and does not have to stop our integration with the eu , " said viktor rajds , a 47-year-old economist taking part in the protest . " we are protesting against kostunica , " said a student who only identified herself as dijana .
" he would like to destroy everything because of kosovo , when there are things much more important , such as a better life , which are not possible without the eu .

" if the authorities do not want to take the way of european integration without compromise , we will return the next weeks with radical requests and much more . " last month , brussels offered belgrade the interim deal on political dialogue , free trade , visa relaxation and educational cooperation in place of a wider rapprochement accord . tadic , who opposes kosovo 's independence but not at the cost of serbia 's eu integration , was re-elected on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 11.02.2008 german chancellor rejects turkish view on integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel disagreed with some of erdogan 's comments on educating turks in germany turkish prime minister erdogan called on his compatriots living in germany not to give up their ethnicity .
chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .

our fashion , our music even our food can be found in any country in the world .
but how do people know what everything is if they do n't understand the language ? one of the most difficult things about living in a foreign country is getting to know what you 're actually buying in the supermarket .
if the products do n't feature any images then it 's usually anyone 's guess what it actually is , especially if the language in which the ingredients are written is a completely alien one . these risks are multiplied in a globalized world .
your own supermarket , filled with recognizable products and brands , have been infiltrated by foreign goods .
luckily , they are usually arranged on the shelves beside familiar products that give you some indication of whether you should eat the unknown product , rub it on you body or clean your toilet with it . the absences of such supermarket-shelf context , however , spilled out onto the streets of germany in last week 's carnival festivities .
one incident led the german police to issue a warning to the public about the dangers of eating shower gel . new danger to be added to list of carnival risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german shower gel : not to be taken internally it appears that during the procession in lampertheim , south of frankfurt , the traditional practice of throwing free treats to the watching crowds included a new risk .
common complaints during carnival often include eye damage from flying sweets and injuries sustained while fighting for candy but poisoning from eating italian shower gel is a new and unusual one - even by german carnival standards . an unidentified victim , who suffered burning sensations in the mouth and throat after eating the snack , which he thought was a dairy product , was unable to read any of the italian words on the label of the free gift except the fragrance description : " yoghurt . " police could not confirm whether anyone else had mistaken the soap for food . many gifts thrown to the masses during the late-winter festivities are low-priced turkish and southern european brands that are not on sale internationally and have no translations on the packaging .

german officials fear that at least four islamists have left germany for terror training in camps along the afghan-pakistani border , according to a news report .
now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .
a 25-year-old man named salih s. from the central state of hesse vanished after leaving behind a letter to his family , saying that he would join the jihad . a 28-year-old man called cüney c. from bavaria cleared out his apartment and headed for pakistan , where german officials apparently lost track of him .
according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our fashion , our music even our food can be found in any country in the world .
but how do people know what everything is if they do n't understand the language ? one of the most difficult things about living in a foreign country is getting to know what you 're actually buying in the supermarket .
if the products do n't feature any images then it 's usually anyone 's guess what it actually is , especially if the language in which the ingredients are written is a completely alien one . these risks are multiplied in a globalized world .
your own supermarket , filled with recognizable products and brands , have been infiltrated by foreign goods .
luckily , they are usually arranged on the shelves beside familiar products that give you some indication of whether you should eat the unknown product , rub it on you body or clean your toilet with it . the absences of such supermarket-shelf context , however , spilled out onto the streets of germany in last week 's carnival festivities .
one incident led the german police to issue a warning to the public about the dangers of eating shower gel . new danger to be added to list of carnival risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german shower gel : not to be taken internally it appears that during the procession in lampertheim , south of frankfurt , the traditional practice of throwing free treats to the watching crowds included a new risk .
common complaints during carnival often include eye damage from flying sweets and injuries sustained while fighting for candy but poisoning from eating italian shower gel is a new and unusual one - even by german carnival standards . an unidentified victim , who suffered burning sensations in the mouth and throat after eating the snack , which he thought was a dairy product , was unable to read any of the italian words on the label of the free gift except the fragrance description : " yoghurt . " police could not confirm whether anyone else had mistaken the soap for food . many gifts thrown to the masses during the late-winter festivities are low-priced turkish and southern european brands that are not on sale internationally and have no translations on the packaging .

german officials fear that at least four islamists have left germany for terror training in camps along the afghan-pakistani border , according to a news report .
now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .
a 25-year-old man named salih s. from the central state of hesse vanished after leaving behind a letter to his family , saying that he would join the jihad . a 28-year-old man called cüney c. from bavaria cleared out his apartment and headed for pakistan , where german officials apparently lost track of him .
according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .
while in germany , olmert will also meet with german president horst köhler , parliamentary representatives and leaders of the local jewish community . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .

german officials fear that at least four islamists have left germany for terror training in camps along the afghan-pakistani border , according to a news report .
now the main objective is to keep them from returning . german news magazine der spiegel reported in its edition on monday , feb .
11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .
a 25-year-old man named salih s. from the central state of hesse vanished after leaving behind a letter to his family , saying that he would join the jihad . a 28-year-old man called cüney c. from bavaria cleared out his apartment and headed for pakistan , where german officials apparently lost track of him .
according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .

demands on workers are increasing while job security is decreasing , according to a new study . europe 's reputation for 35-hour work weeks and generous amounts of vacation time belies the fact that many workers find themselves facing an unhealthy amount of stress . stress is responsible for more than half of all missed work days , costing the european economy an estimated 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- each year , according to statistics from the european agency for safety and health at work -lrb- eu-osha -rrb- .
the agency recently released a study results on psychosocial risks in the workplace . there 's no doubt that job insecurity and high work intensity can pose a danger to workers ' health , said jukka takala , director of eu-osha . " working life in europe is changing at an ever-increasing speed , " takala said . feeling insecure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stress is a major cause of missed work days increasingly , european workers are offered temporary contracts , which can cause feelings of job insecurity .
furthermore , many of the workers with precarious employment contracts tend to carry out the most hazardous jobs , work in poorer conditions and receive less safety training , according to the study . another problem deals with europe 's ageing workforce .
the study found that older workers are not getting the training they need to deal with increasing demands made on them .
this has a negative impact on their health and increases the chance of work-related accidents . all workers are being asked to take on more tasks .
workers are facing increasing pressure , which can lead to a drop in perceived security .
sometimes , workers are not compensated for increased workload and do not receive the necessary support to carry it out , according to the study . taking stress home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some workers have trouble balancing work and private life in some cases european work situations are downright hostile .

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .
" the german government is responsible for these people , without them sacrificing their cultural plurality . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .

by the end of that year , austria , belgium , ireland , luxembourg , portugal and switzerland had joined the three founding nations .
unlike viking lottery , all prizes are of the same amount in each country .
it is unclear at this time whether the proposed new lottery would incorporate or replace euromillions or if any of the countries currently involved in euromillions would be involved . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euromillions already joins nine countries in a scheme another collective , euromillions , a scheme set up by lottery companies francaise des jeux in france , loterias y apuestas del estado in spain and camelot in britain , started in early 2004 .
by the end of that year , austria , belgium , ireland , luxembourg , portugal and switzerland had joined the three founding nations .
unlike viking lottery , all prizes are of the same amount in each country .
it is unclear at this time whether the proposed new lottery would incorporate or replace euromillions or if any of the countries currently involved in euromillions would be involved . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .

11 , carrying blue eu balloons and pro-european banners to urge their leaders to continue serbia 's process of integration into the european union . they chanted anti-kostunica slogans , demanded the government and parliament be allowed to continue their work and called for the immediate signing of an eu pact , which was originally intended to be agreed on last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marchers said they do n't want only the status of kosovo to determine serbia 's future " down with kostunica , the new milosevic , " some shouted in reference to the late autocratic leader slobodan milosevic , ousted in a popular uprising in 2000 as the protests continued despite plummeting temperatures and icy winds . last week kostunica blocked a cabinet meeting , fearing his coalition partners would approve the deal with the eu that he believes would be the first step to the independence of kosovo .
the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .
the request has so far been refused by the official , a supporter of pro-western president boris tadic , responsible for calling emergency sessions of parliament . students call for action on eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationalist graffiti reads : " never eu " the student protestors marched towards the serbian government building , led by a band of noisy drummers , where speakers urged the government to push for serbia 's membership of the eu regardless of what happens to the breakaway kosovo province . " whatever the solution for kosovo , it can not and does not have to stop our integration with the eu , " said viktor rajds , a 47-year-old economist taking part in the protest . " we are protesting against kostunica , " said a student who only identified herself as dijana .
" he would like to destroy everything because of kosovo , when there are things much more important , such as a better life , which are not possible without the eu . " after presenting their demands to the government , student union leader simon simonovic told the demonstrators to give the authorities time to see whether their requests will be met . protestors pledge to continue campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic supports serbia 's route to eu membership " young people want to join the eu and there is no compromise for this , " said simonovic .
" if the authorities do not want to take the way of european integration without compromise , we will return the next weeks with radical requests and much more . " last month , brussels offered belgrade the interim deal on political dialogue , free trade , visa relaxation and educational cooperation in place of a wider rapprochement accord . tadic , who opposes kosovo 's independence but not at the cost of serbia 's eu integration , was re-elected on feb .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .

the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .

" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 11.02.2008 german chancellor rejects turkish view on integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel disagreed with some of erdogan 's comments on educating turks in germany turkish prime minister erdogan called on his compatriots living in germany not to give up their ethnicity .
chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .
" the german government is responsible for these people , without them sacrificing their cultural plurality . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euromillions already joins nine countries in a scheme another collective , euromillions , a scheme set up by lottery companies francaise des jeux in france , loterias y apuestas del estado in spain and camelot in britain , started in early 2004 .
by the end of that year , austria , belgium , ireland , luxembourg , portugal and switzerland had joined the three founding nations .
unlike viking lottery , all prizes are of the same amount in each country .
it is unclear at this time whether the proposed new lottery would incorporate or replace euromillions or if any of the countries currently involved in euromillions would be involved . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu , which plans to send a mission to kosovo , has made it clear that it would support an independent kosovo despite protests from nationalist serbs . after blocking the meeting , kostunica requested a debate on the eu mission to kosovo in the serbian parliament where he has the support of the ultra-nationalist radical party and socialists once led by slobodan milosevic .

" whatever the solution for kosovo , it can not and does not have to stop our integration with the eu , " said viktor rajds , a 47-year-old economist taking part in the protest . " we are protesting against kostunica , " said a student who only identified herself as dijana .
" he would like to destroy everything because of kosovo , when there are things much more important , such as a better life , which are not possible without the eu .

" if the authorities do not want to take the way of european integration without compromise , we will return the next weeks with radical requests and much more . " last month , brussels offered belgrade the interim deal on political dialogue , free trade , visa relaxation and educational cooperation in place of a wider rapprochement accord . tadic , who opposes kosovo 's independence but not at the cost of serbia 's eu integration , was re-elected on feb .

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .

our fashion , our music even our food can be found in any country in the world .
but how do people know what everything is if they do n't understand the language ? one of the most difficult things about living in a foreign country is getting to know what you 're actually buying in the supermarket .
if the products do n't feature any images then it 's usually anyone 's guess what it actually is , especially if the language in which the ingredients are written is a completely alien one . these risks are multiplied in a globalized world .
your own supermarket , filled with recognizable products and brands , have been infiltrated by foreign goods .
luckily , they are usually arranged on the shelves beside familiar products that give you some indication of whether you should eat the unknown product , rub it on you body or clean your toilet with it . the absences of such supermarket-shelf context , however , spilled out onto the streets of germany in last week 's carnival festivities .

" police could not confirm whether anyone else had mistaken the soap for food . many gifts thrown to the masses during the late-winter festivities are low-priced turkish and southern european brands that are not on sale internationally and have no translations on the packaging .

11 , that officials for germany 's federal criminal police -lrb- bka -rrb- believe the four men in their twenties are being trained to conduct terror attacks in germany . at the end of last year , 20-year-old eric b. , a german convert to islam , and 23-year-old houssain al-m . , a stateless man of lebanese origin , headed to pakistan via dubai and iran , according to the report . both men are thought to belong to a group called islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- in the southwestern state of saarland , which had planned a major terror attack in germany in the fall of 2007 .
german officials prevented that attack and arrested three terror suspects in september . terror training with family bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic militants training in pakistan two more men have disappeared from germany and are likely to have joined terror camps , the report stated .

according to e-mails he sent , he is planning to join the jihad with his entire family . while bka officials did not want to confirm the report , according to the associated press news service , the country 's law enforcement agencies are on high alert with regards to a possible terror attack . police want more controls bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officials want more tools to combat terrorism deputy interior minister august hanning said late last week that the threat level had risen since last summer . " the decision to attack europe and also germany has been made in the pakistani tribal regions , " he said . according to the spiegel report , german law enforcement officials are therefore trying to prevent the four islamists from returning to germany and putting their training into practice . german police union officials meanwhile accused lawmakers of neglecting the country 's security interests , saying that more control tools were needed . " those who do n't close these gaps right now will bear the responsibility for possible attacks , " konrad freiberg , the police union 's president , told hanover 's neue presse newspaper over the weekend . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .

this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chances of hitting a euro jackpot may be about to increase in an age where europeans are increasingly urged to share and cooperate across borders , it seems only logical that someone would have the idea to spread the possibility of wealth and good fortune between neighbors . plans are being mulled over by nine european countries to create a cross-border lottery where citizens of those countries joining the proposed scheme could stand to profit from jackpots which increase in size every week .
" it 's true there are talks among several european lotteries on creating a joint , jackpot-oriented game , " klaus sattler , spokesman for the baden-württemberg state lottery commission , said in a statement from stuttgart over the weekend .
sattler would not confirm if germany would be one of the countries involved .
germany 's mass-circulation tabloid bild reported that the lottery would be drawn every friday starting this autumn , with the jackpot always amounting to at least 10 million euros -lrb- $ 14.5 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros .
players would have to correctly guess five numbers out of 50 to win an ordinary prize and pick two more out of eight to gain the jackpot , the newspaper said .
pan-european scheme not a new idea the idea of a pan-european lottery is not a new one .
the nordic countries - norway , sweden , denmark , iceland , finland and estonia - became the first to form a lottery cooperative in 1993 .
viking lottery has a top prize which remains of the same value for all the countries involved , while the smaller prizes are decided locally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : euromillions already joins nine countries in a scheme another collective , euromillions , a scheme set up by lottery companies francaise des jeux in france , loterias y apuestas del estado in spain and camelot in britain , started in early 2004 .
by the end of that year , austria , belgium , ireland , luxembourg , portugal and switzerland had joined the three founding nations .
unlike viking lottery , all prizes are of the same amount in each country .
it is unclear at this time whether the proposed new lottery would incorporate or replace euromillions or if any of the countries currently involved in euromillions would be involved . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration . merkel said she was pleased that turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan had pronounced himself in favor of integration .
but she wondered if they were talking about the same thing . " we will have to continue debating our understanding of integration issues with the turkish prime minister , " merkel said during a visit to the northern city of hamburg on monday , feb .
11 . erdogan shocked germans when he warned turks against losing their culture during a political speech to 20,000 turks in cologne on sunday . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan said . erdogan encouraged turks living in germany to teach their children to speak german , but he warned against giving up their turkish ethnicity .
merkel sharply disagreed with many of his statements . " i am pleased he pronounces himself in favor of integration and learning the german language , but long-term life in a country also involves a stronger acceptance of its habits , " she said .
" i do n't think we have reached the end of this debate . " integration debate continues statistics show that some 2.4 million people of turkish origin live in germany , more than in any other country in western europe .
some are well integrated into german life .
others live a ghettoized existence where they speak only turkish and maintain old traditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called on turkish teachers to work at turkish schools in germany merkel , who has promoted offering turkey a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than full membership , has been a proponent of integration for foreigners , holding a series of summits on the issue .
merkel and her conservative christian democratic union take the view that immigrants should adapt to german culture . this has caused frequent ire in parts of the turkish community which advocate a multicultural approach . ali kizilkaya , head of the german muslim group islamrat , told the tagesspiegel newspaper that erdogan 's sunday speech had touched many turks in germany by encouraging them not to forget their culture .
kizilkaya said he found it unbelievable that the speech had sparked outrage among german conservatives . " a lot of turks finally got the feeling a government leader was listening to them , " kizilkaya said of erdogan 's visit .
" that 's something merkel could do too . " educating future generations but conservative leaders , such as bavarian premier guenther beckstein , were alarmed by the turkish prime minister 's remarks .
beckstein called them " nationalistic " and " highly displeasing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish students wo n't get turkish teachers " the task -lrb- for turks -rrb- is to be good citizens in germany , to learn german and to speak german in their families , " beckstein told n24 television . one further sticking point is whether students should be taught in turkish .
merkel 's government has been steadfast in saying that the primary language of instruction needs to be german . erdogan , however , suggested that since german-language schools and universities exist in turkey , the opposite is desirable in germany .
he said ankara could supply the teachers .
merkel rejected that idea .
teachers need to be trained in germany , not abroad , merkel said monday . search for cultural balance the chancellor said she supported ethnic turks who grew up in germany becoming teachers since these young people " know the problems of integration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is n't seen the same way by everyone merkel said she also gave her backing to more schools offering turkish as a second language " just like they offer english or french or chinese . " but merkel added that she did n't want " a child here going to a turkish-language school where they learn german as their fifth foreign language . " merkel also reiterated that for minority youth living in germany , she is their leader , not erdogan . " if you have a concern , then this concern is just as important to me as it is to someone who can say they 500 years of german ancestry , " she said .
" the german government is responsible for these people , without them sacrificing their cultural plurality . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : climate change : the world 's greatest challenge germany : allowances for co2 emissions during nuke phase-out german environment minister calls off biofuel plans cebit features green computing possibilities eu wants to set pace in protecting environment climate -pipe- 11.02.2008 eu cities commit to climate package , but challenges lay ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is one of the eu cities committed to reducing its co2 levels by 20 percent by 2020 fighting global warming can happen one city at a time .
this is the belief of those who signed up to the eu 's new climate package .
now , those cities who pledged to slash their co2 are facing the reality of their promise . almost 100 european cities committed themselves recently to the european union 's campaign to fight global warming .
the covenant of mayors , as the plan has been dubbed , commits the city councils involved to cutting emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- by more than 20 percent by 2020 .
london , berlin , venice and warsaw are among the cities that have signed up to the pledge which goes one better than a promise made by the eu 's national governments in march 2007 to cut their co2 emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 .
the initiative , to be coordinated by the eu 's executive , the european commission , is expected to help cities share ideas on how best to fight global warming .
" cities are becoming the places to deliver new ideas and innovative projects against global warming ...
cities must therefore become leading actors for implementing sustainable energy policies , " eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs said at the launch of the initiative .
some of the cities involved have already made their own steps towards dealing with co2 emissions .
london , for example , pioneered the use of congestion charging , a scheme which makes motorists pay to enter the city center .
others , however , face an uphill struggle to reduce their co2 output .
warsaw and riga and other cities in former communist countries have seen an explosion in construction and car use in recent years , and their emissions have risen accordingly .
cities to get in step with eu 's plan for 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso 's eu commission has taken the lead in climate change the european commission wants to lead the world 's industrialized countries into a global climate deal by 2009 to help arrest global warming , which risks raising sea levels and causing more floods and droughts .
its plans for doing so have already been released in draft form , causing some argument as to whether the proposals go far enough .
under the 2009 plan , local authorities in europe will have to present regular reports and provide action plans as to how they intend to reduce their cities ' carbon dioxide output .
those who do not conform to the rules will be excluded from the plan , which allots european money to local authorities to aid their climate programs and promote energy efficiency or renewable energy in the region .
" no town can change the climate situation on its own , " said regina kneiding , the berlin senate 's environmental spokeswoman .
" only together and in the long term can we make an actual contribution . "
the covenant of mayors , just as the overall eu plan for 2009 , does not go far enough , according to bund , the german branch of the environmental group friends of the earth .
german cities , in particular , appear to be getting an easier ride considering the federal government has set its own co2 reduction target at 40 percent . german cities need to commit to more , say groups bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has set itself some high targets " in this case , german cities should be setting their own targets at 40 percent , " criticized andreas jarfe , bund berlin 's director .
this is a view taken by the climate alliance of european cities , a europe-wide environmental pressure group .
" germany 's cities must follow what the government is planning on a national level , " said project leader ulrike janssen .
according to senate data , the german capital has reduced its emissions output to 20 percent of its 1990 level .
nevertheless , jarfe still sees many possibilities for saving energy in berlin , particularly in the renovation of buildings .
however , private companies are still more preoccupied with fast profits than energy efficiency .
the result is that heating systems are updated but the walls remain the same in terms of thickness and inadequate insulation .
" with building renovation , there is still room for improvement , " regina kneiding said .
energy efficiency the key , say scientists bildunterschrift : advances in home energy efficiency can help the climate the modernization of energy efficiency is backed by scientists in germany as a way of tackling climate change on a municipal level .
" the continuing modernization is very important , " said guido spor of the university of applied sciences department for traffic and transportation in erfurt .
" increased and more advanced insulation in roofs and cellars is already making a big difference . "
however , spor added that the national reduction targets would be difficult to achieve .
erfurt introduced its own scheme to reduce its emissions by 30 percent by 2020 at the start of february and that , spor said , was already a tough target .
the 40 percent level set by the federal government was " very ambitious , " he said , and that only by developing strong support structures would this be attainable . dirk eckert -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

on sylt , you have to go swimming every day - no matter what the weather 's like .
the best place to swim is called puan klent and there 's a great beach there .
every time i stand at the water , the same thing happens : it 's rather chilly , it 's windy and the waves are big .
i have to hurry .
i take off my windbreaker and dive into the water , which is always very clean .
it 's an unforgettable feeling ! after my swim , i go over to the other side of the island - to the wadden sea mudflats .

wading through it is fun !

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

the premier " will discuss the serious problem of iran 's nuclear program , " an israeli government official told news agency afp on condition of anonymity before the visit .
" we expect further efforts in terms of economic and political pressure on iran to renounce its nuclear projects , and germany is a key player in this , " the official added .
" all options on the table " germany has traditionally been among the top exporters to iran , sending goods worth 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has called for israel to be wiped off the map last month , germany joined the five permanent members of the un security council - britain , the us , france , russia and china - in formulating a third un resolution against iran containing stringent sanctions to further tighten the economic screws .
they include mandatory travel bans , asset freezes and monitoring all banks in the country .
the international community widely believes iran is developing a secret program to build nuclear weapons , a charge tehran denies .
israel considers iran its arch-foe following repeated calls by president mahmoud ahmadinejad for israel to be wiped off the map .
olmert said last month israel , widely considered the middle east 's sole if undeclared nuclear power , would not be reconciled to a nuclear iran and " all options are on the table .
" a secure and stable israel " this week , diplomats said iran was testing an advanced centrifuge at its natanz nuclear complex , a move many fear could lead tehran to enrich uranium faster - a prerequisite for building nuclear weapons .
tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for peaceful civilian means , largely for producing electricity .
the islamic republic remains under sanctions for concealing the program until 2003 and preventing un inspectors since then from inspecting its facilities .
olmert , who is scheduled to meet merkel on tuesday , feb .
12 , is to brief the german chancellor on peace negotiations he initiated with palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a us-led conference in annapolis , maryland , last november .
" germany and the european union will do everything in their power to support the peace process … our goal is that a secure and stable israel and a palestinian state can live as neighbors in the region in peace and freedom , " merkel said on saturday in her weekly online podcast .

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

demands on workers are increasing while job security is decreasing , according to a new study . europe 's reputation for 35-hour work weeks and generous amounts of vacation time belies the fact that many workers find themselves facing an unhealthy amount of stress . stress is responsible for more than half of all missed work days , costing the european economy an estimated 20 billion euros -lrb- $ 29 billion -rrb- each year , according to statistics from the european agency for safety and health at work -lrb- eu-osha -rrb- .

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .

when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

have you been to germany , too ?
click on the link below to tell us about your trip . nikolai ivanov , 21 , is a student from st. petersburg , russia . my favorite destination in germany : the island of sylt in north frisia my preferred accommodation : youth hostels a perfect day on sylt : it 's a beautiful summer day , but i still put on a windbreaker before i go out - not because it 's supposed to rain , but because there 's a constant stormy wind on the island , even in the summer .
on sylt , you have to go swimming every day - no matter what the weather 's like .
the best place to swim is called puan klent and there 's a great beach there .
every time i stand at the water , the same thing happens : it 's rather chilly , it 's windy and the waves are big .
i have to hurry .
i take off my windbreaker and dive into the water , which is always very clean .
it 's an unforgettable feeling ! after my swim , i go over to the other side of the island - to the wadden sea mudflats .
people say that the mud from the wadden sea has a healing effect .
wading through it is fun !
in the evening , i enjoy drinking a cup of coffee in a cozy beach cafe in the village hörnum - next to the famous lighthouse . i tend to spend my money on : postcards , souvenirs , food and drink . my tip : do n't just stick to typical tourist places .
in every city or region , try to find something new - old ruins off the beaten path perhaps , or simply a pub where the locals gather .
only then can you have the feeling that you 've really " discovered " germany . where i want to visit next : i would like to travel to berlin and munich . what i like best about germany : the friendliness of the people .

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

have you been to germany , too ?
click on the link below to tell us about your trip . nikolai ivanov , 21 , is a student from st. petersburg , russia . my favorite destination in germany : the island of sylt in north frisia my preferred accommodation : youth hostels a perfect day on sylt : it 's a beautiful summer day , but i still put on a windbreaker before i go out - not because it 's supposed to rain , but because there 's a constant stormy wind on the island , even in the summer .
on sylt , you have to go swimming every day - no matter what the weather 's like .
the best place to swim is called puan klent and there 's a great beach there .
every time i stand at the water , the same thing happens : it 's rather chilly , it 's windy and the waves are big .
i have to hurry .
i take off my windbreaker and dive into the water , which is always very clean .
it 's an unforgettable feeling ! after my swim , i go over to the other side of the island - to the wadden sea mudflats .
people say that the mud from the wadden sea has a healing effect .
wading through it is fun !
in the evening , i enjoy drinking a cup of coffee in a cozy beach cafe in the village hörnum - next to the famous lighthouse . i tend to spend my money on : postcards , souvenirs , food and drink . my tip : do n't just stick to typical tourist places .
in every city or region , try to find something new - old ruins off the beaten path perhaps , or simply a pub where the locals gather .
only then can you have the feeling that you 've really " discovered " germany . where i want to visit next : i would like to travel to berlin and munich . what i like best about germany : the friendliness of the people .
and being able to relive the fairy tales of times gone by in germany 's medieval cities . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the series continues in ireland . marilena is an italian who moved to ireland two years ago to study english .
she now works as a cashier at a cinema .
she lives 20 minutes by bus from the city of cork and shares a house with her partner .
the house has two floors and is about 160 square meters -lrb- 1,722 square feet -rrb- . monthly income : 1,120 euros -lrb- $ 1,653 -rrb- rent : 240 euros per month -lrb- $ 354 -rrb- monthly utilities : 35 euros -lrb- $ 51.65 -rrb- one liter milk : 0.60 euros -lrb- $ 0.88 -rrb- loaf of bread : 1.20 euros -lrb- $ 1.77 -rrb- one kilogram of sugar : 0.80 euros -lrb- $ 1.18 -rrb- movie ticket : 5.50 euros -lrb- $ 8.12 -rrb- before 5:00 p.m. , 8.50 euros -lrb- $ 12.55 -rrb- after 5:00 p.m. have you noticed that things have become more expensive recently ? yes , after the summer the prices have risen . how easy is it for you to get by ? in my opinion people who are working do n't have any problems in meeting their needs , but the problem is for people who sign a new work contract .
when you begin a new job you begin at the base salary and that could be a problem .
but with the years that pass your salary will increase so it 's only hard in the beginning . in any case the irish government helps people .
in my opinion , here in ireland you ca n't talk about poverty , when i look around and talk to people , i see that there are n't any really poor people here .
i have n't heard of people talking about economic difficulties here . the only thing that people say is expensive is entertainment .
to go out , to go to a restaurant , the cinema or in a pub you pay a lot .
if you work and you stay at home then i think you are able to put some money aside , but if you like to go out and have a social life , such as going to a nightclub , then you have to pay for it .
for example , in italy my home country , for girls it 's free to go to most nightclubs , but in ireland even the girls have to pay . to what extent does inflation affect you ? since january the prices have increased .
i 've been reading in the papers that the cost of buying a house has increased .
here in ireland , at this moment the construction industry is in crisis .
they began to build a large number of houses to be rented out to guest workers , from counties like poland .
now many of the workers have returned home , so there 's a large number of houses but they 're empty .
that keeps the construction industry from moving ahead because there are already too many houses and they have n't been sold or rented . the rent is therefore really cheap , but if you want to buy then it 's really expensive . what 's your opinion on the european economy ? even with the minimum wage here in ireland you manage to meet your needs .
i 'm someone who likes to go out , to have a good time and not stay at home , but even i manage to do this .
i can even plan a holiday .
the minimum wage allows for basic things , but you can live well here in ireland .
it 's all proportional , you pay a lot but you earn enough . nb .

click on the link below to tell us about your trip . nikolai ivanov , 21 , is a student from st. petersburg , russia . my favorite destination in germany : the island of sylt in north frisia my preferred accommodation : youth hostels a perfect day on sylt : it 's a beautiful summer day , but i still put on a windbreaker before i go out - not because it 's supposed to rain , but because there 's a constant stormy wind on the island , even in the summer .
on sylt , you have to go swimming every day - no matter what the weather 's like .
the best place to swim is called puan klent and there 's a great beach there .
every time i stand at the water , the same thing happens : it 's rather chilly , it 's windy and the waves are big .
i have to hurry .
i take off my windbreaker and dive into the water , which is always very clean .
it 's an unforgettable feeling ! after my swim , i go over to the other side of the island - to the wadden sea mudflats .
people say that the mud from the wadden sea has a healing effect .
wading through it is fun !

our fashion , our music even our food can be found in any country in the world .
but how do people know what everything is if they do n't understand the language ? one of the most difficult things about living in a foreign country is getting to know what you 're actually buying in the supermarket .
if the products do n't feature any images then it 's usually anyone 's guess what it actually is , especially if the language in which the ingredients are written is a completely alien one . these risks are multiplied in a globalized world .
your own supermarket , filled with recognizable products and brands , have been infiltrated by foreign goods .
luckily , they are usually arranged on the shelves beside familiar products that give you some indication of whether you should eat the unknown product , rub it on you body or clean your toilet with it . the absences of such supermarket-shelf context , however , spilled out onto the streets of germany in last week 's carnival festivities .
one incident led the german police to issue a warning to the public about the dangers of eating shower gel . new danger to be added to list of carnival risks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german shower gel : not to be taken internally it appears that during the procession in lampertheim , south of frankfurt , the traditional practice of throwing free treats to the watching crowds included a new risk .
common complaints during carnival often include eye damage from flying sweets and injuries sustained while fighting for candy but poisoning from eating italian shower gel is a new and unusual one - even by german carnival standards . an unidentified victim , who suffered burning sensations in the mouth and throat after eating the snack , which he thought was a dairy product , was unable to read any of the italian words on the label of the free gift except the fragrance description : " yoghurt . " police could not confirm whether anyone else had mistaken the soap for food . many gifts thrown to the masses during the late-winter festivities are low-priced turkish and southern european brands that are not on sale internationally and have no translations on the packaging .
most product safety laws only apply to goods on sale , not hand-outs . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

have you been to germany , too ?
click on the link below to tell us about your trip . nikolai ivanov , 21 , is a student from st. petersburg , russia . my favorite destination in germany : the island of sylt in north frisia my preferred accommodation : youth hostels a perfect day on sylt : it 's a beautiful summer day , but i still put on a windbreaker before i go out - not because it 's supposed to rain , but because there 's a constant stormy wind on the island , even in the summer .
on sylt , you have to go swimming every day - no matter what the weather 's like .
the best place to swim is called puan klent and there 's a great beach there .
every time i stand at the water , the same thing happens : it 's rather chilly , it 's windy and the waves are big .
i have to hurry .
i take off my windbreaker and dive into the water , which is always very clean .
it 's an unforgettable feeling ! after my swim , i go over to the other side of the island - to the wadden sea mudflats .
people say that the mud from the wadden sea has a healing effect .
wading through it is fun !
in the evening , i enjoy drinking a cup of coffee in a cozy beach cafe in the village hörnum - next to the famous lighthouse . i tend to spend my money on : postcards , souvenirs , food and drink . my tip : do n't just stick to typical tourist places .
in every city or region , try to find something new - old ruins off the beaten path perhaps , or simply a pub where the locals gather .
only then can you have the feeling that you 've really " discovered " germany . where i want to visit next : i would like to travel to berlin and munich . what i like best about germany : the friendliness of the people .

the group , called anonymous , said they wanted to highlight the organisation 's " inherent flaws " and " fight for freedom of knowledge and information " .
the city of london police said about 200 people took part in the peaceful protest in queen victoria street .
after about two hours the protestors moved to the scientology recruitment centre in tottenham court road .
similar gatherings took place outside scientology centres across the uk and in countries including australia , canada and the us .
in a video statement broadcast online , the organisers said : " the idea of anonymous is to systematically dismantle the church of scientology in its present form . "
' religious bigotry ' they said they were campaigning against " toxic ideals " and a " corrupt leadership " , not the beliefs of members .
anonymous posted a scientology video of tom cruise on the internet last month , which was taken down after complaints about copyright infringement .
janet laveau , from the church of scientology , said the protest group were " cyber-terrorists " motivated by " religious bigotry " .
she said : " the actions of anonymous will not interrupt the church 's normal activities serving its parishioners and the community , and the church is working in co-ordination with local authorities to minimize the negative impact of this mask-wearing , cyber-terrorist group . "
the protests were held on 10 february to mark the birthday of lisa mcpherson , an american scientologist who died in 1995 while under the care of the organisation .

the group , called anonymous , said they wanted to highlight the organisation 's " inherent flaws " and " fight for freedom of knowledge and information " .
the city of london police said about 200 people took part in the peaceful protest in queen victoria street .
after about two hours the protestors moved to the scientology recruitment centre in tottenham court road .
similar gatherings took place outside scientology centres across the uk and in countries including australia , canada and the us .
in a video statement broadcast online , the organisers said : " the idea of anonymous is to systematically dismantle the church of scientology in its present form . "
' religious bigotry ' they said they were campaigning against " toxic ideals " and a " corrupt leadership " , not the beliefs of members .
anonymous posted a scientology video of tom cruise on the internet last month , which was taken down after complaints about copyright infringement .
janet laveau , from the church of scientology , said the protest group were " cyber-terrorists " motivated by " religious bigotry " .
she said : " the actions of anonymous will not interrupt the church 's normal activities serving its parishioners and the community , and the church is working in co-ordination with local authorities to minimize the negative impact of this mask-wearing , cyber-terrorist group . "
the protests were held on 10 february to mark the birthday of lisa mcpherson , an american scientologist who died in 1995 while under the care of the organisation .

the new series , which features guest appearances from shane ritchie and bill bailey , offers more of the same .
april pearson , 19 , who plays michelle , talks about skins parties , finding fame and her grandparents ' reaction to the series .
you were born and bred in bristol .
is that the same for many other cast members ?
i think five of us are born and bred in bristol and the rest are from elsewhere but i think the idea at the beginning was to try and get as many bristolians as possible .
it adds another layer of reality to it because we all know where the skins crew hang out - i think it does help .
during filming , the bristolians stay at home and the rest of them stay in a very posh hotel .
we try and hang out here as much as possible but we got told off a few times for doing that .
are you friends with the other actors ?
of course .
now the bulk of the filming 's finished we 're just trying to keep in touch and i think we probably will .
when we were filming we used to hang out all the time and we 'd always try to go out as a group .
as the show got more popular , it was obviously a bit more difficult when we were trying to move around as a group because people kept recognising us .
were there any cast parties and were they as wild as the ones on the show ?
i 'm not sure whether they were as wild .
but we 're a group of young teenagers who got together so it got pretty frisky , if you will .
what is it like filming those trademark skins parties ?
generally party scenes , although they look fun , go on all day because there 's so many angles you have to get .
in fact , they 're generally quite tiresome after a while .
in between each shot you just stand around and then dance again when they say action .
what was the wildest party you went to as a teenager ?
probably a house party where someone 's house got completely trashed .
i think every teenager 's been to a party like that .
your character michelle split up with her boyfriend tony -lrb- played by about a boy star nicholas hoult -rrb- in the last series .
will they be getting together in series two ?
i could n't possibly divulge that information .
but michelle definitely has a few liaisons in series two and whether that 's with tony or with another member of the cast , i will leave up to you . "
my parents have got used to it now " april pearson on skins ' racier moments in series one , tony messes about with other girls but michelle keeps going back to him .
was michelle right to do that ?
i think she was blinded by the fact that he was the coolest guy around and the hottest guy in town and she felt like she had to grab hold of him and keep hold of him .
i would n't have if it was me .
i think i would have chucked him miles before he messed me around that much .
what can we expect from the second series ?
we 're all a lot better because , for most of us , skins was our first ever job .
so we know the score and we 're acting a bit better - from my point of view anyway .
can you tell us a secret from the new series ?
there are two deaths .
they could be main cast , they could be ancillary cast , it could be anyone .
i 'm not saying more than that .
how well do you think skins tackles teenage issues ?
i think that 's one of the best things about it , it 's definitely true and honest and faces issues that teenagers have without trying to make it a morality issue .
it 's not trying to force it down your neck and saying " this is the moral of the story , you do n't have to do this " .
how has your life been changed by skins ?
i would n't ever say it 's changed in a bad way .
it 's opened up so many doors and taken me on the career path i 've always wanted .
i get recognised in town a bit i would n't say it 's hindering my life in any way .
sometimes it gets a bit annoying when you just want to go get some milk , but i have n't ever had anyone coming up to me and saying they hate me and they want me to die .
what do your parents and grandparents think of the show ?
my parents have got used to it now .
right in the beginning , it was a bit of a shock but they 've learnt to love it , i think .
as for my grandparents , i 'm not sure they 're coming around to the idea right now .
i think they 're looking forward to me doing something a little less controversial and hopefully that will happen .

the new series , which features guest appearances from shane ritchie and bill bailey , offers more of the same .
april pearson , 19 , who plays michelle , talks about skins parties , finding fame and her grandparents ' reaction to the series .
you were born and bred in bristol .
is that the same for many other cast members ?
i think five of us are born and bred in bristol and the rest are from elsewhere but i think the idea at the beginning was to try and get as many bristolians as possible .
it adds another layer of reality to it because we all know where the skins crew hang out - i think it does help .
during filming , the bristolians stay at home and the rest of them stay in a very posh hotel .
we try and hang out here as much as possible but we got told off a few times for doing that .
are you friends with the other actors ?
of course .
now the bulk of the filming 's finished we 're just trying to keep in touch and i think we probably will .
when we were filming we used to hang out all the time and we 'd always try to go out as a group .
as the show got more popular , it was obviously a bit more difficult when we were trying to move around as a group because people kept recognising us .
were there any cast parties and were they as wild as the ones on the show ?
i 'm not sure whether they were as wild .
but we 're a group of young teenagers who got together so it got pretty frisky , if you will .
what is it like filming those trademark skins parties ?
generally party scenes , although they look fun , go on all day because there 's so many angles you have to get .
in fact , they 're generally quite tiresome after a while .
in between each shot you just stand around and then dance again when they say action .
what was the wildest party you went to as a teenager ?
probably a house party where someone 's house got completely trashed .
i think every teenager 's been to a party like that .
your character michelle split up with her boyfriend tony -lrb- played by about a boy star nicholas hoult -rrb- in the last series .
will they be getting together in series two ?
i could n't possibly divulge that information .
but michelle definitely has a few liaisons in series two and whether that 's with tony or with another member of the cast , i will leave up to you . "
my parents have got used to it now " april pearson on skins ' racier moments in series one , tony messes about with other girls but michelle keeps going back to him .
was michelle right to do that ?
i think she was blinded by the fact that he was the coolest guy around and the hottest guy in town and she felt like she had to grab hold of him and keep hold of him .
i would n't have if it was me .
i think i would have chucked him miles before he messed me around that much .
what can we expect from the second series ?
we 're all a lot better because , for most of us , skins was our first ever job .
so we know the score and we 're acting a bit better - from my point of view anyway .
can you tell us a secret from the new series ?
there are two deaths .
they could be main cast , they could be ancillary cast , it could be anyone .
i 'm not saying more than that .
how well do you think skins tackles teenage issues ?
i think that 's one of the best things about it , it 's definitely true and honest and faces issues that teenagers have without trying to make it a morality issue .
it 's not trying to force it down your neck and saying " this is the moral of the story , you do n't have to do this " .

right in the beginning , it was a bit of a shock but they 've learnt to love it , i think .
as for my grandparents , i 'm not sure they 're coming around to the idea right now .
i think they 're looking forward to me doing something a little less controversial and hopefully that will happen .

the new series , which features guest appearances from shane ritchie and bill bailey , offers more of the same .
april pearson , 19 , who plays michelle , talks about skins parties , finding fame and her grandparents ' reaction to the series .
you were born and bred in bristol .
is that the same for many other cast members ?
i think five of us are born and bred in bristol and the rest are from elsewhere but i think the idea at the beginning was to try and get as many bristolians as possible .
it adds another layer of reality to it because we all know where the skins crew hang out - i think it does help .
during filming , the bristolians stay at home and the rest of them stay in a very posh hotel .
we try and hang out here as much as possible but we got told off a few times for doing that .
are you friends with the other actors ?
of course .
now the bulk of the filming 's finished we 're just trying to keep in touch and i think we probably will .
when we were filming we used to hang out all the time and we 'd always try to go out as a group .
as the show got more popular , it was obviously a bit more difficult when we were trying to move around as a group because people kept recognising us .
the cast were all teenagers when they filmed the first series were there any cast parties and were they as wild as the ones on the show ?
i 'm not sure whether they were as wild .
but we 're a group of young teenagers who got together so it got pretty frisky , if you will .
what is it like filming those trademark skins parties ?
generally party scenes , although they look fun , go on all day because there 's so many angles you have to get .
in fact , they 're generally quite tiresome after a while .
in between each shot you just stand around and then dance again when they say action .
what was the wildest party you went to as a teenager ?
probably a house party where someone 's house got completely trashed .
i think every teenager 's been to a party like that .
your character michelle split up with her boyfriend tony -lrb- played by about a boy star nicholas hoult -rrb- in the last series .
will they be getting together in series two ?
i could n't possibly divulge that information .
but michelle definitely has a few liaisons in series two and whether that 's with tony or with another member of the cast , i will leave up to you .
my parents have got used to it now april pearson on skins ' racier moments in series one , tony messes about with other girls but michelle keeps going back to him .
was michelle right to do that ?
i think she was blinded by the fact that he was the coolest guy around and the hottest guy in town and she felt like she had to grab hold of him and keep hold of him .
i would n't have if it was me .
i think i would have chucked him miles before he messed me around that much .
what can we expect from the second series ?
we 're all a lot better because , for most of us , skins was our first ever job .
so we know the score and we 're acting a bit better - from my point of view anyway .
can you tell us a secret from the new series ?
there are two deaths .
they could be main cast , they could be ancillary cast , it could be anyone .
i 'm not saying more than that .
how well do you think skins tackles teenage issues ?
i think that 's one of the best things about it , it 's definitely true and honest and faces issues that teenagers have without trying to make it a morality issue .
it 's not trying to force it down your neck and saying " this is the moral of the story , you do n't have to do this " .
skins was up for best drama at the edinburgh tv festival awards how has your life been changed by skins ?
i would n't ever say it 's changed in a bad way .
it 's opened up so many doors and taken me on the career path i 've always wanted .
i get recognised in town a bit i would n't say it 's hindering my life in any way .
sometimes it gets a bit annoying when you just want to go get some milk , but i have n't ever had anyone coming up to me and saying they hate me and they want me to die .
what do your parents and grandparents think of the show ?
my parents have got used to it now .
right in the beginning , it was a bit of a shock but they 've learnt to love it , i think .
as for my grandparents , i 'm not sure they 're coming around to the idea right now .
i think they 're looking forward to me doing something a little less controversial and hopefully that will happen .

by jane wakefield technology reporter , bbc news the show moved from cannes because it needed a bigger city an opportunity to get up close and personal with hollywood icon robert redford is among the highlights at the annual world mobile congress -lrb- formerly known as 3gsm -rrb- .
rubbing shoulders with mobile operators , content providers and handset manufacturers in the gaudi-inspired streets of barcelona will be plenty of big web brands and representatives from the world of entertainment - including redford , who will be one of the conference 's key speakers .
every year there is a debate about just how much the mobile handset can do and whether it can become the all-encompassing device for gadget lovers .
with phones on show packing plenty of memory , some think the phone is ready to compete with digital music players .
" it could finally become a credible alternative to the stand-alone music player , " said ben wood , director of research at analyst firm ccs insight .
among technologies that will enhance this idea is dolby 's newly launched surround sound for mobiles .
it will use the congress to announce deals with symbian , texas instruments , arm and rmi .
its dolby mobile system will also support video , and video is likely to be a big talking point .
film star redford will be talking about making short movies just for mobiles to date the mobile industry has flirted with films with motorola shipping its z8 handset with the bourne identity and nokia offering users of its n95 8gb model , the spiderman 3 movie .
that 's where robert redford , star of movies such as butch cassidy and the sundance kid and all the president 's men and director of films including ordinary people , comes in .
his keynote speech will examine the opportunity of making bespoke short films for mobiles .
most analysts now agree that watching a full-length feature film on a mobile phone is unlikely to appeal to many mobile users .
instead it will be bite-sized highlights and news and sports clips which will capture consumers ' imaginations .
with apple offering already offering ipod users over 500 tv series and with 120m tv shows sold to date , it could be the firm that heralds the newly portable video age .
" people will put tv shows on their ipods and ask why they ca n't have that on their mobiles , then find out that they can , " said mr wood .
the market for user-generated content should also not be underestimated .
" the youtube generation watch far more user-generated content than they do packaged content .
if the network structure and the pricing can be got right that could take off in a big way , " said margaret rice-jones , chief executive of mobile consultants aircom .
cheaper network for operators the biggest question remains how to make money from services and for years it has been kicking around the idea of mobile advertising .
the marriage of operators keen to make money from ads and consumers who find them intrusive is likely to remain a tricky one although there are suggestions that , for some , it could be a happy relationship .
blyk offers a free network to 16-24 year-olds in return for advertising and has generated a response rate of 29 % among its target group .
more appealing for consumers might be the idea that the mobile network can finally compete and prove cheaper than fixed line .
with 3g networks in europe now capable of offering speeds of up to 8mbps -lrb- megabits per second -rrb- and with memory sticks and dongles that offer high-speed access without the need for wires , there are even rumblings about how much we need fixed line access .
" mobile broadband is more than capable of competing with the fixed-line broadband market in certain socio-demographic groups , " said michael phillips , product director of broadbandchoices.co.uk.
people who rent - from young professionals to students and foreign workers - might find the no-contract obligations of mobile broadband more attractive that having to pay landline activation charges .

by jane wakefield technology reporter , bbc news an opportunity to get up close and personal with hollywood icon robert redford is among the highlights at the annual world mobile congress -lrb- formerly known as 3gsm -rrb- .
rubbing shoulders with mobile operators , content providers and handset manufacturers in the gaudi-inspired streets of barcelona will be plenty of big web brands and representatives from the world of entertainment - including redford , who will be one of the conference 's key speakers .
every year there is a debate about just how much the mobile handset can do and whether it can become the all-encompassing device for gadget lovers .
with phones on show packing plenty of memory , some think the phone is ready to compete with digital music players .
" it could finally become a credible alternative to the stand-alone music player , " said ben wood , director of research at analyst firm ccs insight .
among technologies that will enhance this idea is dolby 's newly launched surround sound for mobiles .
it will use the congress to announce deals with symbian , texas instruments , arm and rmi .
its dolby mobile system will also support video , and video is likely to be a big talking point .
film star to date the mobile industry has flirted with films with motorola shipping its z8 handset with the bourne identity and nokia offering users of its n95 8gb model , the spiderman 3 movie .
that 's where robert redford , star of movies such as butch cassidy and the sundance kid and all the president 's men and director of films including ordinary people , comes in .
his keynote speech will examine the opportunity of making bespoke short films for mobiles .
most analysts now agree that watching a full-length feature film on a mobile phone is unlikely to appeal to many mobile users .
instead it will be bite-sized highlights and news and sports clips which will capture consumers ' imaginations .
with apple offering already offering ipod users over 500 tv series and with 120m tv shows sold to date , it could be the firm that heralds the newly portable video age .
" people will put tv shows on their ipods and ask why they ca n't have that on their mobiles , then find out that they can , " said mr wood .
the market for user-generated content should also not be underestimated .
" the youtube generation watch far more user-generated content than they do packaged content .
if the network structure and the pricing can be got right that could take off in a big way , " said margaret rice-jones , chief executive of mobile consultants aircom .
cheaper network for operators the biggest question remains how to make money from services and for years it has been kicking around the idea of mobile advertising .

the jazz and planet rock are to go , and gcap 's stake in digital one , a national broadcasting platform for digital stations , will be sold to arqiva .
gcap also plans to boost advertising at its flagship capital 95.8 station .
in january , gcap rejected an approach from rival global radio that valued it at about £ 313m .
we believe a further offer from global radio is likely and that other parties could also enter the fray roddy davidson , altium securities check gcap share price b > what future for dab radio ?
chief executive fru hazlitt said digital " was not an economically viable growth platform for gcap media " .
she said gcap hoped to make £ 8.8m of annual savings through disposals and restructuring .
she also hopes gcap , whose stations include choice and xfm , can achieve profit margins of up to 19 % by march 2010 under the " radical but realistic " plans .
in november gcap , hit in recent years by falling advertising revenues , reported a 3 % fall in six month underlying pre-tax profits to £ 5.6m.
gcap 's previous chief executive , ralph bernard , quit last year after profits fell on the back of sliding advertising revenues .
altium securities analyst roddy davidson said : " we believe a further offer from global radio is likely and that other parties could also enter the fray . "
meanwhile , bbc radio and the 4 digital group confirmed their commitment to develop digital radio in the uk .
the two parties said they would look at ways of encouraging more rapid consumer take-up of digital radio and developing the available technology to secure a successful future for dab .
