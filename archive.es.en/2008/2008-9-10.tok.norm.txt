sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .

russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .

" the outlook for growth has clearly worsened for the second half of this year , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
he blamed high energy and food prices as well as a global financial slowdown for the slump .
the executive arm of the eu also cut the bloc 's 2008 growth estimates for a second time in seven months , this time to 1.4 per cent .
the commission had previously forecast a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth rate for the 27-member bloc of 2.0 per cent .
the commission 's february interim estimate had in turn been revised down by about half a percentage point from its november forecast .
gdp for the 15-member eurozone , which shares the common euro currency , was similarly revised down , from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent , in line with analysts ' expectations .
german institute echoes bleak eu forecast echoing the eu 's dark forecast , a leading berlin institute said wednesday europe 's largest economy is set to contract by 0.1 percent in the current , third quarter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are feeling the pinch of high prices , in turn leading to low consumer spending the forecast , part of the diw 's " barometer " series , is worse than an earlier diw prediction that there would be nil growth in this quarter in germany .
diw said it saw a weakening in industrial production and in construction .
for the whole of 2008 , the eu commission forecast that the german economy would expand 1.8 percent , unchanged from its last estimate dating from april .
europe 's economic slowdown is blamed on a combination of factors , most notably a deepening of the global financial turmoil , the international credit crunch due to the collapse of the housing markets and soaring commodity prices .
the commission now expects inflation to average 3.6 per cent in the eurozone this year .
jean-claude trichet , head of the european central bank , warned the economic crisis had become a " continual process " and said europe " needs to be alert . "
germany 's top banker remain upbeat but josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , stuck wednesday to his optimistic prediction that the world financial crisis will be over soon .
his remarks at a conference in frankfurt contrasted with the more pessimistic eurozone outlook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann is unruffled by the barrage of bad economic news ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest commercial bank , told a gathering organized by german newspaper handelsblatt that the end of the downturn was becoming more tangible .
" we see a stabilization .
we see the beginning of the end .
there is growing confirmation of that , " he said .
ackermann also said he did not expect us investment bank lehman brothers to fail despite its huge problems this week .
" a collapse of a bank on this scale would have a whole train of repercussions .
but i do n't expect it to happen , " he said .
" i assume solutions will be found if it comes to the worst . "
bad news for britain and spain in a statement accompanying wednesday 's interim forecasts , the eu commission said plummeting business and consumer confidence , as well as falling industrial production and retail sales in europe , suggest " a bleak outlook " for the eu economies .
in britain , which is reeling from a wobbly housing market and turmoil on financial markets , economic activity is expected to contract by 0.2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen a mushrooming of " for sale " signs that would bring growth in britain , which is not a member of the eurozone , for the whole of 2008 to 1.1 percent , down from an april forecast of 1.7 percent .
the commission also slashed its 2008 growth forecast for spain to 1.4 percent , down from its april estimate of 2.2 percent .
with a long housing boom turning to bust , spain would see its economy contract by 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.3 percent in the final three months of the year , the commission said .
italy too confirmed its reputation as " the sick man of europe " after its economic growth for 2008 was slashed from 0.5 to just 0.1 per cent . dw staff -lrb- df / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 10.09.2008 german education spending below other nations : oecd report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite budgetary woes , germany is one of top three destinations for foreign students germany is falling behind in producing qualified university graduates because average public spending on higher education is well behind most other western nations , a new report said this week . the rising cost of higher education means either increasing public spending or introducing private fees for schools and universities .
both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .
nearly nine percent of foreigners choose to pursue their studies in germany . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 10.09.2008 happy birthday , mr. lagerfeld , however old you are großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld is rarely seen without his trademark sunglasses dark glasses , black suits and a white ponytail : karl lagerfeld is a fashion icon .
but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .

it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .

germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .
" germany can not afford a full year of electioneering between the chancellor and the deputy chancellor , " he said .
meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz say germany must present a united front steinmeier has frequently clashed with the chancellor on issues such as the human rights situation in china and russia , where he has taken a less overtly critical approach than merkel .
ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .
the head of the employers ' organization bda , dieter hundt , noted that steinmeier and muentefering were both close associates of schroeder and worked together on his agenda 2010 program that slashed social benefits and promoted job creation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering , steinmeier : spd dream team ?
their appointment offered the chance that the agenda 2010 program , widely credited with cutting unemployment by 2 million over the past three years and putting the federal budget on course for balance by 2011 , would be continued , hundt said .
german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- president georg ludwig braun also welcomed the changes as bringing clarity to the party .
the dihk had long worked effectively with the new duo at the top of the spd , despite clear differences of opinion , he said .
muentefering told reporters merkel 's party might dominate the government , " but it does not represent the majority political view . "
he admitted the spd trailed far behind , but said it could catch up to the cdu by next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .

couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .

he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .

klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .
other problems cited by wuttke included the exclusion of foreign firms from infrastructure projects and government procurement programs in china .
" economic nationalism is primarily driven by economic interest groups that try to gain a monopoly and try to exclude foreigners , " he said .

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly nine percent of foreigners choose to pursue their studies in germany . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .
other problems cited by wuttke included the exclusion of foreign firms from infrastructure projects and government procurement programs in china .
" economic nationalism is primarily driven by economic interest groups that try to gain a monopoly and try to exclude foreigners , " he said .
the eu chamber said it would use the annual report to lobby the chinese government , the european commission and eu member states . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .
" germany can not afford a full year of electioneering between the chancellor and the deputy chancellor , " he said .
meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz say germany must present a united front steinmeier has frequently clashed with the chancellor on issues such as the human rights situation in china and russia , where he has taken a less overtly critical approach than merkel .
ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .
the head of the employers ' organization bda , dieter hundt , noted that steinmeier and muentefering were both close associates of schroeder and worked together on his agenda 2010 program that slashed social benefits and promoted job creation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering , steinmeier : spd dream team ?
their appointment offered the chance that the agenda 2010 program , widely credited with cutting unemployment by 2 million over the past three years and putting the federal budget on course for balance by 2011 , would be continued , hundt said .
german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- president georg ludwig braun also welcomed the changes as bringing clarity to the party .
the dihk had long worked effectively with the new duo at the top of the spd , despite clear differences of opinion , he said .
muentefering told reporters merkel 's party might dominate the government , " but it does not represent the majority political view . "
he admitted the spd trailed far behind , but said it could catch up to the cdu by next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .
other problems cited by wuttke included the exclusion of foreign firms from infrastructure projects and government procurement programs in china .
" economic nationalism is primarily driven by economic interest groups that try to gain a monopoly and try to exclude foreigners , " he said .
the eu chamber said it would use the annual report to lobby the chinese government , the european commission and eu member states . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 10.09.2008 happy birthday , mr. lagerfeld , however old you are großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld is rarely seen without his trademark sunglasses dark glasses , black suits and a white ponytail : karl lagerfeld is a fashion icon .
but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.09.2008 " major contributions to science " expected from lhc says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. wilczek believes the lhc will lead to great breakthroughs in physics as the physics world excitedly watches the first ever activation of the lhc particle collider , nobel prize laureate and mit physics professor frank wilczek told dw-world.de what scientists hope to find . how do you explain the highly emotional discussion that has been sparked by the long hadron collider project ?
well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .

christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.09.2008 " major contributions to science " expected from lhc says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. wilczek believes the lhc will lead to great breakthroughs in physics as the physics world excitedly watches the first ever activation of the lhc particle collider , nobel prize laureate and mit physics professor frank wilczek told dw-world.de what scientists hope to find . how do you explain the highly emotional discussion that has been sparked by the long hadron collider project ?
well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .

10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.09.2008 scientists in europe successfully test new atom smasher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists around the world are looking forward to information produced by the large hadron collider europe 's center for nuclear research made scientific history when it successfully tested the world 's largest particle collider on wednesday .
some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia : eu observers can watch the widrawal , in part the issue has been brought into sharper focus against the backdrop of events in georgia , where the us has accused russia of seeking to redraw the map by brutally violating another country 's territorial integrity .
russia poured tanks and thousands of troops into its southern neighbour last month as it repelled a georgian attempt to regain control of the breakaway province of south ossetia from moscow-backed separatists .
dispute over role of eu peacekeepers russian president dmitry medvedev committed on monday , sept .
8 , to pull all russian troops back from georgia - apart from the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - within a month .
medvedev also pledged to allow 200 eu observers to join other international staff in monitoring the withdrawal and ensuring the truce .
but foreign minister lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility that eu observers would be allowed into south ossetia and abkhazia .

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 10.09.2008 happy birthday , mr. lagerfeld , however old you are großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld is rarely seen without his trademark sunglasses dark glasses , black suits and a white ponytail : karl lagerfeld is a fashion icon .
but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finasteride is on a list of banned substances because , according to the statement , although it does not enhance performance itself , it can be used to conceal drugs that do .
the substance is , however , also found in anti-hair loss treatments , which is what coskun claimed he was using it for according to the statement .
" i was thinking about my hair and had no idea that the drug , which is against hair loss , contained a banned substance .
i 'm very upset .
i never intended to do doping , " the statement quoted 33-year-old coskun as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.09.2008 germany headed for recession , eu commission says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's robust economic recovery is under threat again the european commission forecast on wednesday that europe 's largest economy is heading for a recession this year and said britain and spain too are in for a major economic downturn . warning of tough times ahead , the european commission on wednesday estimated the three eu heavyweights would see two consecutive quarters of economic contraction over the course of this year . " the outlook for growth has clearly worsened for the second half of this year , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
he blamed high energy and food prices as well as a global financial slowdown for the slump .
the executive arm of the eu also cut the bloc 's 2008 growth estimates for a second time in seven months , this time to 1.4 per cent .
the commission had previously forecast a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth rate for the 27-member bloc of 2.0 per cent .
the commission 's february interim estimate had in turn been revised down by about half a percentage point from its november forecast .
gdp for the 15-member eurozone , which shares the common euro currency , was similarly revised down , from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent , in line with analysts ' expectations .
german institute echoes bleak eu forecast echoing the eu 's dark forecast , a leading berlin institute said wednesday europe 's largest economy is set to contract by 0.1 percent in the current , third quarter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are feeling the pinch of high prices , in turn leading to low consumer spending the forecast , part of the diw 's " barometer " series , is worse than an earlier diw prediction that there would be nil growth in this quarter in germany .
diw said it saw a weakening in industrial production and in construction .
for the whole of 2008 , the eu commission forecast that the german economy would expand 1.8 percent , unchanged from its last estimate dating from april .
europe 's economic slowdown is blamed on a combination of factors , most notably a deepening of the global financial turmoil , the international credit crunch due to the collapse of the housing markets and soaring commodity prices .
the commission now expects inflation to average 3.6 per cent in the eurozone this year .
jean-claude trichet , head of the european central bank , warned the economic crisis had become a " continual process " and said europe " needs to be alert . "
germany 's top banker remain upbeat but josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , stuck wednesday to his optimistic prediction that the world financial crisis will be over soon .
his remarks at a conference in frankfurt contrasted with the more pessimistic eurozone outlook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann is unruffled by the barrage of bad economic news ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest commercial bank , told a gathering organized by german newspaper handelsblatt that the end of the downturn was becoming more tangible .
" we see a stabilization .
we see the beginning of the end .
there is growing confirmation of that , " he said .
ackermann also said he did not expect us investment bank lehman brothers to fail despite its huge problems this week .
" a collapse of a bank on this scale would have a whole train of repercussions .
but i do n't expect it to happen , " he said .
" i assume solutions will be found if it comes to the worst . "
bad news for britain and spain in a statement accompanying wednesday 's interim forecasts , the eu commission said plummeting business and consumer confidence , as well as falling industrial production and retail sales in europe , suggest " a bleak outlook " for the eu economies .
in britain , which is reeling from a wobbly housing market and turmoil on financial markets , economic activity is expected to contract by 0.2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen a mushrooming of " for sale " signs that would bring growth in britain , which is not a member of the eurozone , for the whole of 2008 to 1.1 percent , down from an april forecast of 1.7 percent .
the commission also slashed its 2008 growth forecast for spain to 1.4 percent , down from its april estimate of 2.2 percent .
with a long housing boom turning to bust , spain would see its economy contract by 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.3 percent in the final three months of the year , the commission said .
italy too confirmed its reputation as " the sick man of europe " after its economic growth for 2008 was slashed from 0.5 to just 0.1 per cent . dw staff -lrb- df / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .

it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the outlook for growth has clearly worsened for the second half of this year , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
he blamed high energy and food prices as well as a global financial slowdown for the slump .
the executive arm of the eu also cut the bloc 's 2008 growth estimates for a second time in seven months , this time to 1.4 per cent .
the commission had previously forecast a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth rate for the 27-member bloc of 2.0 per cent .
the commission 's february interim estimate had in turn been revised down by about half a percentage point from its november forecast .
gdp for the 15-member eurozone , which shares the common euro currency , was similarly revised down , from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent , in line with analysts ' expectations .
german institute echoes bleak eu forecast echoing the eu 's dark forecast , a leading berlin institute said wednesday europe 's largest economy is set to contract by 0.1 percent in the current , third quarter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are feeling the pinch of high prices , in turn leading to low consumer spending the forecast , part of the diw 's " barometer " series , is worse than an earlier diw prediction that there would be nil growth in this quarter in germany .
diw said it saw a weakening in industrial production and in construction .
for the whole of 2008 , the eu commission forecast that the german economy would expand 1.8 percent , unchanged from its last estimate dating from april .
europe 's economic slowdown is blamed on a combination of factors , most notably a deepening of the global financial turmoil , the international credit crunch due to the collapse of the housing markets and soaring commodity prices .
the commission now expects inflation to average 3.6 per cent in the eurozone this year .
jean-claude trichet , head of the european central bank , warned the economic crisis had become a " continual process " and said europe " needs to be alert . "
germany 's top banker remain upbeat but josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , stuck wednesday to his optimistic prediction that the world financial crisis will be over soon .
his remarks at a conference in frankfurt contrasted with the more pessimistic eurozone outlook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann is unruffled by the barrage of bad economic news ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest commercial bank , told a gathering organized by german newspaper handelsblatt that the end of the downturn was becoming more tangible .
" we see a stabilization .
we see the beginning of the end .
there is growing confirmation of that , " he said .
ackermann also said he did not expect us investment bank lehman brothers to fail despite its huge problems this week .
" a collapse of a bank on this scale would have a whole train of repercussions .
but i do n't expect it to happen , " he said .
" i assume solutions will be found if it comes to the worst . "
bad news for britain and spain in a statement accompanying wednesday 's interim forecasts , the eu commission said plummeting business and consumer confidence , as well as falling industrial production and retail sales in europe , suggest " a bleak outlook " for the eu economies .
in britain , which is reeling from a wobbly housing market and turmoil on financial markets , economic activity is expected to contract by 0.2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen a mushrooming of " for sale " signs that would bring growth in britain , which is not a member of the eurozone , for the whole of 2008 to 1.1 percent , down from an april forecast of 1.7 percent .
the commission also slashed its 2008 growth forecast for spain to 1.4 percent , down from its april estimate of 2.2 percent .
with a long housing boom turning to bust , spain would see its economy contract by 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.3 percent in the final three months of the year , the commission said .
italy too confirmed its reputation as " the sick man of europe " after its economic growth for 2008 was slashed from 0.5 to just 0.1 per cent . dw staff -lrb- df / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .

" the outlook for growth has clearly worsened for the second half of this year , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
he blamed high energy and food prices as well as a global financial slowdown for the slump .
the executive arm of the eu also cut the bloc 's 2008 growth estimates for a second time in seven months , this time to 1.4 per cent .
the commission had previously forecast a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth rate for the 27-member bloc of 2.0 per cent .
the commission 's february interim estimate had in turn been revised down by about half a percentage point from its november forecast .
gdp for the 15-member eurozone , which shares the common euro currency , was similarly revised down , from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent , in line with analysts ' expectations .
german institute echoes bleak eu forecast echoing the eu 's dark forecast , a leading berlin institute said wednesday europe 's largest economy is set to contract by 0.1 percent in the current , third quarter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are feeling the pinch of high prices , in turn leading to low consumer spending the forecast , part of the diw 's " barometer " series , is worse than an earlier diw prediction that there would be nil growth in this quarter in germany .
diw said it saw a weakening in industrial production and in construction .
for the whole of 2008 , the eu commission forecast that the german economy would expand 1.8 percent , unchanged from its last estimate dating from april .
europe 's economic slowdown is blamed on a combination of factors , most notably a deepening of the global financial turmoil , the international credit crunch due to the collapse of the housing markets and soaring commodity prices .
the commission now expects inflation to average 3.6 per cent in the eurozone this year .
jean-claude trichet , head of the european central bank , warned the economic crisis had become a " continual process " and said europe " needs to be alert . "
germany 's top banker remain upbeat but josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , stuck wednesday to his optimistic prediction that the world financial crisis will be over soon .
his remarks at a conference in frankfurt contrasted with the more pessimistic eurozone outlook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann is unruffled by the barrage of bad economic news ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest commercial bank , told a gathering organized by german newspaper handelsblatt that the end of the downturn was becoming more tangible .
" we see a stabilization .
we see the beginning of the end .
there is growing confirmation of that , " he said .
ackermann also said he did not expect us investment bank lehman brothers to fail despite its huge problems this week .
" a collapse of a bank on this scale would have a whole train of repercussions .
but i do n't expect it to happen , " he said .
" i assume solutions will be found if it comes to the worst . "
bad news for britain and spain in a statement accompanying wednesday 's interim forecasts , the eu commission said plummeting business and consumer confidence , as well as falling industrial production and retail sales in europe , suggest " a bleak outlook " for the eu economies .
in britain , which is reeling from a wobbly housing market and turmoil on financial markets , economic activity is expected to contract by 0.2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen a mushrooming of " for sale " signs that would bring growth in britain , which is not a member of the eurozone , for the whole of 2008 to 1.1 percent , down from an april forecast of 1.7 percent .
the commission also slashed its 2008 growth forecast for spain to 1.4 percent , down from its april estimate of 2.2 percent .
with a long housing boom turning to bust , spain would see its economy contract by 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.3 percent in the final three months of the year , the commission said .
italy too confirmed its reputation as " the sick man of europe " after its economic growth for 2008 was slashed from 0.5 to just 0.1 per cent . dw staff -lrb- df / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 10.09.2008 german education spending below other nations : oecd report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite budgetary woes , germany is one of top three destinations for foreign students germany is falling behind in producing qualified university graduates because average public spending on higher education is well behind most other western nations , a new report said this week . the rising cost of higher education means either increasing public spending or introducing private fees for schools and universities .
both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .
other problems cited by wuttke included the exclusion of foreign firms from infrastructure projects and government procurement programs in china .
" economic nationalism is primarily driven by economic interest groups that try to gain a monopoly and try to exclude foreigners , " he said .
the eu chamber said it would use the annual report to lobby the chinese government , the european commission and eu member states . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .
" germany can not afford a full year of electioneering between the chancellor and the deputy chancellor , " he said .
meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz say germany must present a united front steinmeier has frequently clashed with the chancellor on issues such as the human rights situation in china and russia , where he has taken a less overtly critical approach than merkel .
ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .
the head of the employers ' organization bda , dieter hundt , noted that steinmeier and muentefering were both close associates of schroeder and worked together on his agenda 2010 program that slashed social benefits and promoted job creation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering , steinmeier : spd dream team ?
their appointment offered the chance that the agenda 2010 program , widely credited with cutting unemployment by 2 million over the past three years and putting the federal budget on course for balance by 2011 , would be continued , hundt said .
german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- president georg ludwig braun also welcomed the changes as bringing clarity to the party .
the dihk had long worked effectively with the new duo at the top of the spd , despite clear differences of opinion , he said .
muentefering told reporters merkel 's party might dominate the government , " but it does not represent the majority political view . "
he admitted the spd trailed far behind , but said it could catch up to the cdu by next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 10.09.2008 happy birthday , mr. lagerfeld , however old you are großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld is rarely seen without his trademark sunglasses dark glasses , black suits and a white ponytail : karl lagerfeld is a fashion icon .
but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 10.09.2008 german education spending below other nations : oecd report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite budgetary woes , germany is one of top three destinations for foreign students germany is falling behind in producing qualified university graduates because average public spending on higher education is well behind most other western nations , a new report said this week . the rising cost of higher education means either increasing public spending or introducing private fees for schools and universities .
both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .
nearly nine percent of foreigners choose to pursue their studies in germany . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia : eu observers can watch the widrawal , in part the issue has been brought into sharper focus against the backdrop of events in georgia , where the us has accused russia of seeking to redraw the map by brutally violating another country 's territorial integrity .
russia poured tanks and thousands of troops into its southern neighbour last month as it repelled a georgian attempt to regain control of the breakaway province of south ossetia from moscow-backed separatists .
dispute over role of eu peacekeepers russian president dmitry medvedev committed on monday , sept .
8 , to pull all russian troops back from georgia - apart from the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - within a month .
medvedev also pledged to allow 200 eu observers to join other international staff in monitoring the withdrawal and ensuring the truce .
but foreign minister lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility that eu observers would be allowed into south ossetia and abkhazia .
in brussels , however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana claimed the observer mission " will be deployed with the spirit that it can deploy everywhere " , including the two rebel regions . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .

but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .

his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .

on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia : eu observers can watch the widrawal , in part the issue has been brought into sharper focus against the backdrop of events in georgia , where the us has accused russia of seeking to redraw the map by brutally violating another country 's territorial integrity .
russia poured tanks and thousands of troops into its southern neighbour last month as it repelled a georgian attempt to regain control of the breakaway province of south ossetia from moscow-backed separatists .
dispute over role of eu peacekeepers russian president dmitry medvedev committed on monday , sept .
8 , to pull all russian troops back from georgia - apart from the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - within a month .
medvedev also pledged to allow 200 eu observers to join other international staff in monitoring the withdrawal and ensuring the truce .
but foreign minister lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility that eu observers would be allowed into south ossetia and abkhazia .
in brussels , however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana claimed the observer mission " will be deployed with the spirit that it can deploy everywhere " , including the two rebel regions . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .

23 showed the presence of finasteride .
finasteride is on a list of banned substances because , according to the statement , although it does not enhance performance itself , it can be used to conceal drugs that do .
the substance is , however , also found in anti-hair loss treatments , which is what coskun claimed he was using it for according to the statement .
" i was thinking about my hair and had no idea that the drug , which is against hair loss , contained a banned substance .
i 'm very upset .
i never intended to do doping , " the statement quoted 33-year-old coskun as saying .
it is the second incidence of doping ahead of the paralympics opening ceremony after pakistani power lifter naveed ahmed butt tested positive for the steroid methandienone metabolites on tuesday sep .

cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .

ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .

10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.09.2008 " major contributions to science " expected from lhc says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. wilczek believes the lhc will lead to great breakthroughs in physics as the physics world excitedly watches the first ever activation of the lhc particle collider , nobel prize laureate and mit physics professor frank wilczek told dw-world.de what scientists hope to find . how do you explain the highly emotional discussion that has been sparked by the long hadron collider project ?
well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 10.09.2008 eu businesses worried by " economic nationalism " in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european firms say chinese trade barriers are getting more sophisticated in a report released this week , an eu business group said a range of non-tariff barriers to market access in china reflects a growing " economic nationalism " that is against the interests of european firms . " european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.09.2008 scientists in europe successfully test new atom smasher großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists around the world are looking forward to information produced by the large hadron collider europe 's center for nuclear research made scientific history when it successfully tested the world 's largest particle collider on wednesday .
some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "
redundancies not mentioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois , ceo of eads french chairman gallois said that the new plan did not include any reference to job cuts because " growth of the market is such that we can carry it -lrb- the plan -rrb- out without putting in question our existing installations , which we are continuing to modernise . "
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "
redundancies not mentioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois , ceo of eads french chairman gallois said that the new plan did not include any reference to job cuts because " growth of the market is such that we can carry it -lrb- the plan -rrb- out without putting in question our existing installations , which we are continuing to modernise . "
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia : eu observers can watch the widrawal , in part the issue has been brought into sharper focus against the backdrop of events in georgia , where the us has accused russia of seeking to redraw the map by brutally violating another country 's territorial integrity .
russia poured tanks and thousands of troops into its southern neighbour last month as it repelled a georgian attempt to regain control of the breakaway province of south ossetia from moscow-backed separatists .
dispute over role of eu peacekeepers russian president dmitry medvedev committed on monday , sept .
8 , to pull all russian troops back from georgia - apart from the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - within a month .
medvedev also pledged to allow 200 eu observers to join other international staff in monitoring the withdrawal and ensuring the truce .
but foreign minister lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility that eu observers would be allowed into south ossetia and abkhazia .

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .

warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .

lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .

russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .
other problems cited by wuttke included the exclusion of foreign firms from infrastructure projects and government procurement programs in china .
" economic nationalism is primarily driven by economic interest groups that try to gain a monopoly and try to exclude foreigners , " he said .

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "
redundancies not mentioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois , ceo of eads french chairman gallois said that the new plan did not include any reference to job cuts because " growth of the market is such that we can carry it -lrb- the plan -rrb- out without putting in question our existing installations , which we are continuing to modernise . "
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .
other problems cited by wuttke included the exclusion of foreign firms from infrastructure projects and government procurement programs in china .
" economic nationalism is primarily driven by economic interest groups that try to gain a monopoly and try to exclude foreigners , " he said .
the eu chamber said it would use the annual report to lobby the chinese government , the european commission and eu member states . dpa news agency -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .
" germany can not afford a full year of electioneering between the chancellor and the deputy chancellor , " he said .
meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz say germany must present a united front steinmeier has frequently clashed with the chancellor on issues such as the human rights situation in china and russia , where he has taken a less overtly critical approach than merkel .
ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .
the head of the employers ' organization bda , dieter hundt , noted that steinmeier and muentefering were both close associates of schroeder and worked together on his agenda 2010 program that slashed social benefits and promoted job creation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering , steinmeier : spd dream team ?
their appointment offered the chance that the agenda 2010 program , widely credited with cutting unemployment by 2 million over the past three years and putting the federal budget on course for balance by 2011 , would be continued , hundt said .
german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- president georg ludwig braun also welcomed the changes as bringing clarity to the party .
the dihk had long worked effectively with the new duo at the top of the spd , despite clear differences of opinion , he said .

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .
" germany can not afford a full year of electioneering between the chancellor and the deputy chancellor , " he said .
meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz say germany must present a united front steinmeier has frequently clashed with the chancellor on issues such as the human rights situation in china and russia , where he has taken a less overtly critical approach than merkel .
ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .
the head of the employers ' organization bda , dieter hundt , noted that steinmeier and muentefering were both close associates of schroeder and worked together on his agenda 2010 program that slashed social benefits and promoted job creation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering , steinmeier : spd dream team ?
their appointment offered the chance that the agenda 2010 program , widely credited with cutting unemployment by 2 million over the past three years and putting the federal budget on course for balance by 2011 , would be continued , hundt said .
german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- president georg ludwig braun also welcomed the changes as bringing clarity to the party .
the dihk had long worked effectively with the new duo at the top of the spd , despite clear differences of opinion , he said .
muentefering told reporters merkel 's party might dominate the government , " but it does not represent the majority political view . "

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "

“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .

as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .

his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .

as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .

his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .

cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "

" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .

ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .

german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- president georg ludwig braun also welcomed the changes as bringing clarity to the party .
the dihk had long worked effectively with the new duo at the top of the spd , despite clear differences of opinion , he said .

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .
" germany can not afford a full year of electioneering between the chancellor and the deputy chancellor , " he said .
meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz say germany must present a united front steinmeier has frequently clashed with the chancellor on issues such as the human rights situation in china and russia , where he has taken a less overtly critical approach than merkel .
ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .

but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .

in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .

it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .

but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "
redundancies not mentioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois , ceo of eads french chairman gallois said that the new plan did not include any reference to job cuts because " growth of the market is such that we can carry it -lrb- the plan -rrb- out without putting in question our existing installations , which we are continuing to modernise . "
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .

" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .

" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .

meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .

" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .

ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .

the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "

germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .

ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .
other problems cited by wuttke included the exclusion of foreign firms from infrastructure projects and government procurement programs in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 10.09.2008 german education spending below other nations : oecd report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite budgetary woes , germany is one of top three destinations for foreign students germany is falling behind in producing qualified university graduates because average public spending on higher education is well behind most other western nations , a new report said this week . the rising cost of higher education means either increasing public spending or introducing private fees for schools and universities .
both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .
nearly nine percent of foreigners choose to pursue their studies in germany . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .

germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .
nearly nine percent of foreigners choose to pursue their studies in germany . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 10.09.2008 germany face first real qualifying test against finland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany strolled to a 6-0 win over liechtenstein but finland wo n't be as easy germany face the first test of their 2010 world cup qualifying campaign when they take on finland in helsinki on wednesday , sept .
10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .

as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .

his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .

“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .
lagerfeld , it seems , will remain a mystery as long as he chooses to . dw staff -lrb- sje -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .

meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .

ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .
the head of the employers ' organization bda , dieter hundt , noted that steinmeier and muentefering were both close associates of schroeder and worked together on his agenda 2010 program that slashed social benefits and promoted job creation .

however , the working relationship between merkel and her deputy is likely to deteriorate slowly as the elections in 2009 get closer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can steinmeier and merkel keep electioneering at bay ?
christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- merkel criticized the weekend maneuvering in her junior coalition partner that saw the popular steinmeier named as the spd candidate for the chancellorship and kurt beck ousted as party chairman .
cracks in the coalition ?
the machinations within the spd were " unworthy " of a major german party and indicated " deep division , " merkel said , following the unexpected shake-up in the spd hierarchy on sunday .
government spokesman thomas steg said merkel and steinmeier , who also holds the office of deputy chancellor , aimed to focus on the business in hand " until far into next year . "
but political commentators said cooperation within the unwieldy coalition would become increasingly difficult in the months leading up to the elections , provisionally set for sept .
27 , 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in replacing beck , the party moves to center and the chairman of the minority opposition liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , called for early elections .
" germany can not afford a full year of electioneering between the chancellor and the deputy chancellor , " he said .
meanwhile , a key merkel ally urged steinmeier to resist party pressure to campaign on foreign policy issues ahead of the election .
lawmaker urges united foreign-policy front ruprecht polenz , head of the german parliament 's foreign policy committee , said steinmeier 's nomination came with risks at a time of major international crises such as the georgia conflict .
" -lrb- the georgia -rrb- crisis is not yet over .
and on other issues , such as iran or the middle east , germany will have to play an important role inside the eu and has to present a united front , " polenz told reuters news service .
" if other countries receive contradictory messages from germany , germany 's weight in the international community would be reduced .
that 's not in germany 's interests .
germany must present a united front , " polenz told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz say germany must present a united front steinmeier has frequently clashed with the chancellor on issues such as the human rights situation in china and russia , where he has taken a less overtly critical approach than merkel .
ronald pofalla , general secretary of merkel 's cdu , called on steinmeier to make clear the spd 's position on pro-market reforms and on its relations with the socialist left party , which has eaten into the spd support base in recent months .
steinmeier was named the spd 's top candidate in next year 's elections at a closed meeting of around 50 top spd leaders near berlin on sunday .
the announcement had been widely anticipated , but beck 's decision to resign as party chairman in favor of veteran spd campaigner franz muentefering shook the german political landscape .
german business hails spd changes german business welcomed the changes at the top of the spd as marking the return of leaders pledged to maintaining the pro-market reforms initiated by the last spd chancellor , gerhard schroeder .
the head of the employers ' organization bda , dieter hundt , noted that steinmeier and muentefering were both close associates of schroeder and worked together on his agenda 2010 program that slashed social benefits and promoted job creation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering , steinmeier : spd dream team ?
their appointment offered the chance that the agenda 2010 program , widely credited with cutting unemployment by 2 million over the past three years and putting the federal budget on course for balance by 2011 , would be continued , hundt said .
german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- president georg ludwig braun also welcomed the changes as bringing clarity to the party .
the dihk had long worked effectively with the new duo at the top of the spd , despite clear differences of opinion , he said .
muentefering told reporters merkel 's party might dominate the government , " but it does not represent the majority political view . "
he admitted the spd trailed far behind , but said it could catch up to the cdu by next year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .

but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .

" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .
wuttke said foreign businesses were " lacking good success stories " in mergers and acquisitions and would watch " very closely " the planned takeover of china 's leading fruit juice firm by coca-cola co .
chinese state media said the commerce ministry planned an anti-monopoly review of the us-based soft-drink giant 's $ 2.4 billion -lrb- 1.7 billion euros -rrb- offer last week to buy the huiyuan juice group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 10.09.2008 german education spending below other nations : oecd report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite budgetary woes , germany is one of top three destinations for foreign students germany is falling behind in producing qualified university graduates because average public spending on higher education is well behind most other western nations , a new report said this week . the rising cost of higher education means either increasing public spending or introducing private fees for schools and universities .
both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .
nearly nine percent of foreigners choose to pursue their studies in germany . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .

" the outlook for growth has clearly worsened for the second half of this year , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
he blamed high energy and food prices as well as a global financial slowdown for the slump .
the executive arm of the eu also cut the bloc 's 2008 growth estimates for a second time in seven months , this time to 1.4 per cent .
the commission had previously forecast a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth rate for the 27-member bloc of 2.0 per cent .
the commission 's february interim estimate had in turn been revised down by about half a percentage point from its november forecast .
gdp for the 15-member eurozone , which shares the common euro currency , was similarly revised down , from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent , in line with analysts ' expectations .
german institute echoes bleak eu forecast echoing the eu 's dark forecast , a leading berlin institute said wednesday europe 's largest economy is set to contract by 0.1 percent in the current , third quarter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are feeling the pinch of high prices , in turn leading to low consumer spending the forecast , part of the diw 's " barometer " series , is worse than an earlier diw prediction that there would be nil growth in this quarter in germany .
diw said it saw a weakening in industrial production and in construction .
for the whole of 2008 , the eu commission forecast that the german economy would expand 1.8 percent , unchanged from its last estimate dating from april .
europe 's economic slowdown is blamed on a combination of factors , most notably a deepening of the global financial turmoil , the international credit crunch due to the collapse of the housing markets and soaring commodity prices .
the commission now expects inflation to average 3.6 per cent in the eurozone this year .
jean-claude trichet , head of the european central bank , warned the economic crisis had become a " continual process " and said europe " needs to be alert . "
germany 's top banker remain upbeat but josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , stuck wednesday to his optimistic prediction that the world financial crisis will be over soon .
his remarks at a conference in frankfurt contrasted with the more pessimistic eurozone outlook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann is unruffled by the barrage of bad economic news ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest commercial bank , told a gathering organized by german newspaper handelsblatt that the end of the downturn was becoming more tangible .
" we see a stabilization .
we see the beginning of the end .
there is growing confirmation of that , " he said .
ackermann also said he did not expect us investment bank lehman brothers to fail despite its huge problems this week .
" a collapse of a bank on this scale would have a whole train of repercussions .
but i do n't expect it to happen , " he said .
" i assume solutions will be found if it comes to the worst . "
bad news for britain and spain in a statement accompanying wednesday 's interim forecasts , the eu commission said plummeting business and consumer confidence , as well as falling industrial production and retail sales in europe , suggest " a bleak outlook " for the eu economies .
in britain , which is reeling from a wobbly housing market and turmoil on financial markets , economic activity is expected to contract by 0.2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain has seen a mushrooming of " for sale " signs that would bring growth in britain , which is not a member of the eurozone , for the whole of 2008 to 1.1 percent , down from an april forecast of 1.7 percent .
the commission also slashed its 2008 growth forecast for spain to 1.4 percent , down from its april estimate of 2.2 percent .
with a long housing boom turning to bust , spain would see its economy contract by 0.1 percent in the third quarter and 0.3 percent in the final three months of the year , the commission said .
italy too confirmed its reputation as " the sick man of europe " after its economic growth for 2008 was slashed from 0.5 to just 0.1 per cent . dw staff -lrb- df / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .

as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .

experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia : eu observers can watch the widrawal , in part the issue has been brought into sharper focus against the backdrop of events in georgia , where the us has accused russia of seeking to redraw the map by brutally violating another country 's territorial integrity .
russia poured tanks and thousands of troops into its southern neighbour last month as it repelled a georgian attempt to regain control of the breakaway province of south ossetia from moscow-backed separatists .

medvedev also pledged to allow 200 eu observers to join other international staff in monitoring the withdrawal and ensuring the truce .
but foreign minister lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility that eu observers would be allowed into south ossetia and abkhazia .

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "

"
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "

"
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia : eu observers can watch the widrawal , in part the issue has been brought into sharper focus against the backdrop of events in georgia , where the us has accused russia of seeking to redraw the map by brutally violating another country 's territorial integrity .
russia poured tanks and thousands of troops into its southern neighbour last month as it repelled a georgian attempt to regain control of the breakaway province of south ossetia from moscow-backed separatists .
dispute over role of eu peacekeepers russian president dmitry medvedev committed on monday , sept .
8 , to pull all russian troops back from georgia - apart from the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - within a month .
medvedev also pledged to allow 200 eu observers to join other international staff in monitoring the withdrawal and ensuring the truce .
but foreign minister lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility that eu observers would be allowed into south ossetia and abkhazia .
in brussels , however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana claimed the observer mission " will be deployed with the spirit that it can deploy everywhere " , including the two rebel regions . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 10.09.2008 germany headed for recession , eu commission says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's robust economic recovery is under threat again the european commission forecast on wednesday that europe 's largest economy is heading for a recession this year and said britain and spain too are in for a major economic downturn . warning of tough times ahead , the european commission on wednesday estimated the three eu heavyweights would see two consecutive quarters of economic contraction over the course of this year . " the outlook for growth has clearly worsened for the second half of this year , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
he blamed high energy and food prices as well as a global financial slowdown for the slump .
the executive arm of the eu also cut the bloc 's 2008 growth estimates for a second time in seven months , this time to 1.4 per cent .
the commission had previously forecast a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth rate for the 27-member bloc of 2.0 per cent .
the commission 's february interim estimate had in turn been revised down by about half a percentage point from its november forecast .
gdp for the 15-member eurozone , which shares the common euro currency , was similarly revised down , from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent , in line with analysts ' expectations .
german institute echoes bleak eu forecast echoing the eu 's dark forecast , a leading berlin institute said wednesday europe 's largest economy is set to contract by 0.1 percent in the current , third quarter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are feeling the pinch of high prices , in turn leading to low consumer spending the forecast , part of the diw 's " barometer " series , is worse than an earlier diw prediction that there would be nil growth in this quarter in germany .
diw said it saw a weakening in industrial production and in construction .
for the whole of 2008 , the eu commission forecast that the german economy would expand 1.8 percent , unchanged from its last estimate dating from april .
europe 's economic slowdown is blamed on a combination of factors , most notably a deepening of the global financial turmoil , the international credit crunch due to the collapse of the housing markets and soaring commodity prices .
the commission now expects inflation to average 3.6 per cent in the eurozone this year .
jean-claude trichet , head of the european central bank , warned the economic crisis had become a " continual process " and said europe " needs to be alert . "
germany 's top banker remain upbeat but josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , stuck wednesday to his optimistic prediction that the world financial crisis will be over soon .
his remarks at a conference in frankfurt contrasted with the more pessimistic eurozone outlook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann is unruffled by the barrage of bad economic news ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest commercial bank , told a gathering organized by german newspaper handelsblatt that the end of the downturn was becoming more tangible .
" we see a stabilization .
we see the beginning of the end .
there is growing confirmation of that , " he said .
ackermann also said he did not expect us investment bank lehman brothers to fail despite its huge problems this week .
" a collapse of a bank on this scale would have a whole train of repercussions .
but i do n't expect it to happen , " he said .
" i assume solutions will be found if it comes to the worst . "
bad news for britain and spain in a statement accompanying wednesday 's interim forecasts , the eu commission said plummeting business and consumer confidence , as well as falling industrial production and retail sales in europe , suggest " a bleak outlook " for the eu economies .

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .
10 .
and earlier in the day , a russian general threatened to target the planned missile shield sites with icbms .
warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .
14 to base part of a us missile shield in poland , in the face of moscow 's vehement opposition and amid mounting east-west tensions over georgia .
" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .
" this means poland took revenge on us for defending the ossetians .
this is rather small-minded behavior as well as a political mistake , " lavrov said .
bildunterschrift : us , polish diplomats signed the missile deal in august washington plans to base 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic by 2011-2013 to complete a system already in place in the united states , greenland and britain .
also on wednesday , with the signing of an agreement on us forces , the czech government got one step closer to putting a missile-shield plan before the czech parliament .
threats of icbm targets earlier in the day , russia threatened to target planned us missile shield sites in europe .
russian general nikolai solovtsov , head of strategic missile forces , said if the us set up installations in central europe , the kremlin would ensure that russia 's vast nuclear arsenal remained effective .
he criticized a lack of transparency in washington 's plans and warned that its missile shield in poland and the czech republic and " other such objects " could become " designated targets " for inter-continental ballistic missiles .
" we should be sure that the current and future strategic missile forces ... are guaranteed to fulfil the task of strategic deterrence , " he told the afp news service .
georgia conflict highlights problems washington insists its shield - endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - is to fend off potential missile attacks by what it calls " rogue states " , presumably such as iran .
russia has long complained that the system is a security threat designed to undermine its nuclear deterrent .
it has threatened retaliation against the poles and czechs , warning they could become a target for russian attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia : eu observers can watch the widrawal , in part the issue has been brought into sharper focus against the backdrop of events in georgia , where the us has accused russia of seeking to redraw the map by brutally violating another country 's territorial integrity .
russia poured tanks and thousands of troops into its southern neighbour last month as it repelled a georgian attempt to regain control of the breakaway province of south ossetia from moscow-backed separatists .
dispute over role of eu peacekeepers russian president dmitry medvedev committed on monday , sept .
8 , to pull all russian troops back from georgia - apart from the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia - within a month .
medvedev also pledged to allow 200 eu observers to join other international staff in monitoring the withdrawal and ensuring the truce .
but foreign minister lavrov on wednesday ruled out the possibility that eu observers would be allowed into south ossetia and abkhazia .
in brussels , however , eu foreign policy chief javier solana claimed the observer mission " will be deployed with the spirit that it can deploy everywhere " , including the two rebel regions . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "
redundancies not mentioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois , ceo of eads french chairman gallois said that the new plan did not include any reference to job cuts because " growth of the market is such that we can carry it -lrb- the plan -rrb- out without putting in question our existing installations , which we are continuing to modernise . "
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "
redundancies not mentioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois , ceo of eads french chairman gallois said that the new plan did not include any reference to job cuts because " growth of the market is such that we can carry it -lrb- the plan -rrb- out without putting in question our existing installations , which we are continuing to modernise . "
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

9 . unlike the original plan , which was created in response to losses suffered by airbus because of wiring problems with its a 380 superjumbo jet , the new " power 8 plus " program involves the entire company and should save about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.41 billion -rrb- beginning in 2010 , the french daily le monde reported .
of that amount , savings at airbus will total about 650 million euros , while measures involving the eads eurocopter subsidiary as well as the space and military transport divisions will account for 350 million euros in reduced costs .
moving production to us dollar zones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus could be on the move to the united states a large part of the savings at airbus are to be achieved by moving production to " us dollar zones " or where labour is less costly than in europe . eads chairman louis gallois said that airbus would have to " increase its presence in india given the number and quality of its -lrb- india 's -rrb- engineers . "
the french-speaking maghreb region of north africa was of interest " for standard production because of the costs . "
gallois told le monde about plans to build one airbus factory in tunesia and a production base in china " for reasons of proximity to market " , where there have been some big orders for passenger jets . the factory , where airbus is already setting up an assembly line in china for its single-aisle a320 aircraft , is expected to open at the end of september . gallois added that it was " important " for airbus to have a production site in russia as well and mentioned mexico , where the french group safran makes engines and has production facilities , as a possible gateway to the north american market .
the german chief executive of airbus , tom enders , said in the statement : " power8 is the centre piece in airbus ' restructuring and integration efforts and we have been very successful in achieving our targets so far . "
but he added " further measures to improve our cost base and overall efficiency are necessary to secure the long-term competitiveness of our company . "
" by pushing forward with internationalization we secure growth , we take advantage of lower cost structures , we access talent on a world-wide basis and , simultaneously , support employment and core competences in europe . "
redundancies not mentioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois , ceo of eads french chairman gallois said that the new plan did not include any reference to job cuts because " growth of the market is such that we can carry it -lrb- the plan -rrb- out without putting in question our existing installations , which we are continuing to modernise . "
the first power8 cutbacks , which had been announced in 2007 , stipulated the loss of 10,000 jobs , of which half are at the sub-contractor level .
gallois said that airbus intended " to invest in the most sophisticated production facilities in france , and particularly in composite materials , " and to do the same in germany and spain where aircraft parts are also built .

both are anathema in germany , meaning relatively little is being invested in improving the educational system of europe 's largest economy .
the paris-based organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released its annual report on the state of education in the world 's industrialized countries on tuesday with a warning : higher education in germany is slipping behind other oecd members and in the near future , the situation is likely to worsen .
public spending earmarked for education in germany is relatively less than what some thirty other oecd members invest , according to the 2008 report .
in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .

in the five year period between 2000 and 2005 , the average spending on education as part of gross domestic product was 13.2 percent for oecd members , whereas german spending accounted for slightly less than ten percent of the federal budget .
germans less qualified compared to others in oecd more students however are enrolling in german institutions of higher learning and more are graduating , but they tend to be less qualified than their oecd counterparts .
germany does not produce enough homegrown engineering and science graduates for a growing number of high-tech jobs , which are often filled by skilled migrants from india and elsewhere .
even the number of medical graduates and teachers is expected to diminish soon .
“ if this trend continues , the german economy will not be able to meet its demand for qualified people , ” said oecd 's educational director barbara ischinger in an interview with deutsche welle radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany spends less than others on education as a percent of gdp although the oecd report shows that the number of graduates from universities and tertiary institutions rose from 18 to 21 percent in the six year period to 2006 , the average increase for oecd members during the same time bracket was considerably more — from 28 to 37 percent .
us spending way ahead of europe the united states comes out ahead of europe as a whole , according oecd .
american universities on average spent 24,370 dollars -lrb- 17,200 euros -rrb- per student per year in 2005 , compared with $ 10,474 among 19 oecd european countries , which are also eu members .
only switzerland , which is not a european union member , comes close to american spending levels , with the alpine country 's public universities allocating $ 21,734 dollars to each student per year .
the demand for higher education among oecd nations keeps rising though .
in the decade from 1995 to 2005 , the number of young people attending university level programs increased from 37 percent to 57 percent .
governments have generally reacted with three different approaches to such an upsurge in demand .
the scandinavian countries have revamped public expenditure to earmark more funds for public education , whereas the us and japan have increased fees at state institutions , but offer loans and scholarships to lower income students .
increase public spending or introduce tuition fees ?
germany has opted for the third policy choice that prohibits public educational institutions from charging any fees at all , but keeps public spending stagnant , which has only created budgetary problems for universities that the oecd said would impact on the quality of educational programs . the report said “ while choices between greater public investments and a larger share of private money are difficult to make , doing neither in the face of the rising demand for more and better tertiary education seems no longer an option . "
annegret kramp-karrenbauer , who heads the standing conference of the ministers of education and cultural affairs of germany 's 16 states , said she is in favor of introducing tuition fees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough qualified graduates for high tech jobs german official in favor of fees “ i 'm for university fees , but i must add , that whoever introduces them , must also make sure there 's a reasonable access to scholarships .
and compared to other countries , we are way behind in that regard , “ she told deutsche welle radio .
the oecd warned that european governments , such as germany 's should carefully consider the balance between state funding and university fees , noting that per-student expenditure at the university level in many european countries is less than half of the amount spent in the united states .
however for all its budgetary woes , germany still remains one of the top three university destinations for foreign students within the oecd after the us , which takes in 20 percent of foreign students and the uk , which takes in 11.3 percent .
nearly nine percent of foreigners choose to pursue their studies in germany . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .

finasteride is on a list of banned substances because , according to the statement , although it does not enhance performance itself , it can be used to conceal drugs that do .
the substance is , however , also found in anti-hair loss treatments , which is what coskun claimed he was using it for according to the statement .
" i was thinking about my hair and had no idea that the drug , which is against hair loss , contained a banned substance .
i 'm very upset .
i never intended to do doping , " the statement quoted 33-year-old coskun as saying .
it is the second incidence of doping ahead of the paralympics opening ceremony after pakistani power lifter naveed ahmed butt tested positive for the steroid methandienone metabolites on tuesday sep .

10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sergei lavrov warned poland it was making a mistake by hosting a us missile shield . the polish decision to allow the us to install a missile shield on its territory is a " very dangerous game , " which had upset the military balance between washington and moscow , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov told a polish newspaper on wednesday , sept .

warsaw and washington signed a preliminary deal on aug .

" poland appears not to have understood that it has become a party to a very dangerous game , " lavrov said in an interview to the polska daily newspaper ahead of his visit to warsaw on thursday .
lavrov : ' poland took revenge on us ' in warsaw , lavrov is expected to meet with poland 's foreign minister radoslaw sikorski and prime minister donald tusk .
it will be the first visit by a senior moscow official to an eu member nation since the outbreak of the georgia crisis on august 8 .

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .

" european companies are generally optimistic about their business in china , but their concerns remain about market access , transparency , intellectual property rights and environmental sustainability , " the european union chamber of commerce in china said in a " position paper " on tuesday , sept 9 .
" economic nationalism appears to be a growing concern , " the paper , which was based on a survey of many of its 1,400 members , said .
joerg wuttke , president of the chamber , said foreign businesses continued to benefit from china 's strong economic growth but warned that " trade barriers and investment hurdles are getting more sophisticated . "
" european business could contribute more to china 's economy if our companies shared a level playing field with their domestic competitors , " he told reporters .

" the outlook for growth has clearly worsened for the second half of this year , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
he blamed high energy and food prices as well as a global financial slowdown for the slump .
the executive arm of the eu also cut the bloc 's 2008 growth estimates for a second time in seven months , this time to 1.4 per cent .
the commission had previously forecast a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth rate for the 27-member bloc of 2.0 per cent .
the commission 's february interim estimate had in turn been revised down by about half a percentage point from its november forecast .
gdp for the 15-member eurozone , which shares the common euro currency , was similarly revised down , from 1.7 per cent to 1.3 per cent , in line with analysts ' expectations .

diw said it saw a weakening in industrial production and in construction .
for the whole of 2008 , the eu commission forecast that the german economy would expand 1.8 percent , unchanged from its last estimate dating from april .
europe 's economic slowdown is blamed on a combination of factors , most notably a deepening of the global financial turmoil , the international credit crunch due to the collapse of the housing markets and soaring commodity prices .
the commission now expects inflation to average 3.6 per cent in the eurozone this year .
jean-claude trichet , head of the european central bank , warned the economic crisis had become a " continual process " and said europe " needs to be alert . "
germany 's top banker remain upbeat but josef ackermann , chief executive of deutsche bank , stuck wednesday to his optimistic prediction that the world financial crisis will be over soon .
his remarks at a conference in frankfurt contrasted with the more pessimistic eurozone outlook . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann is unruffled by the barrage of bad economic news ackermann , the head of germany 's biggest commercial bank , told a gathering organized by german newspaper handelsblatt that the end of the downturn was becoming more tangible .
" we see a stabilization .
we see the beginning of the end .
there is growing confirmation of that , " he said .
ackermann also said he did not expect us investment bank lehman brothers to fail despite its huge problems this week .
" a collapse of a bank on this scale would have a whole train of repercussions .
but i do n't expect it to happen , " he said .
" i assume solutions will be found if it comes to the worst . "
bad news for britain and spain in a statement accompanying wednesday 's interim forecasts , the eu commission said plummeting business and consumer confidence , as well as falling industrial production and retail sales in europe , suggest " a bleak outlook " for the eu economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.09.2008 " major contributions to science " expected from lhc says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. wilczek believes the lhc will lead to great breakthroughs in physics as the physics world excitedly watches the first ever activation of the lhc particle collider , nobel prize laureate and mit physics professor frank wilczek told dw-world.de what scientists hope to find . how do you explain the highly emotional discussion that has been sparked by the long hadron collider project ?
well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 .
it will be the first real examination of the team since its euro 2008 final defeat . the germans began their qualifying campaign with a comfortable 6-0 outing against liechtenstein in vaduz on saturday , and coach joachim loew looks like keeping an unchanged side against the finns .
it means the attack will again be spearheaded by bayern munich partners lukas podolski and miroslav klose , while the new-look central defense of heiko westermann and serdar tasci will also be retained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski and klose will start up front again for germany podolski is out of favor at bayern munich but bagged a brace against liechtenstein and is already up to 30 goals with the national team from just 56 games .
klose , however , failed to find the net again to continue his run of poor scoring form , but continues to have the coach 's backing .
" miro is very important for the team .
he is a striker of international format and will rediscover his form , " loew said .
finland to provide loew 's team with proper work-out liechtenstein was no yardstick of the state of the german national team following defeat in the euro 2008 final against spain .
" finland will be a different caliber , " loew said monday .
" they have many players from england .
we will have to see how we manage . "
germany , three-time world champions , have a strong record against finland , having lost just once - back in 1923 - in 20 matches .
but their last two meetings in world cup qualifiers in 2001 both ended in draws .
as a result germany had to go into a two-match play-off against ukraine to reach the 2002 finals .
still absent from the germany set-up is captain michael ballack who has returned to london following treatment from the german team doctors on a foot injury .
loew will also be without schalke defender christian pander who left the squad after picking up a viral infection .
ballack and bierhoff still butting heads however a reported row between 31-year-old midfielder ballack and team manager oliver bierhoff has proved a distraction to preparations .
it prompted german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger to call monday on the team to focus on the finland match .
" the coach must be able to concentrate fully on preparing the team for wednesday 's difficult task , " he said , calling on ballack and bierhoff to end their differences .
bildunterschrift : ballack is restrained after the altercation with bierhoff at the end of the euro 2008 final the dispute has been simmering since the euro 2008 final in vienna on june 29 when the two had to be kept apart by players during an altercation on the pitch following the 1-0 defeat to spain .
finland 's english coach stuart baxter will meanwhile have to reshuffle his defense following injury to central defender hannu tihinen , while goalkeeper niko maenpaa , midfielder teemu tainjo and captain jari litmanen are also sidelined .
finland have never qualified for a world cup finals but striker mikael forsell believes the team has a chance of making it to south africa in 2010 .
the hanover striker , who comes up against club team-mate robert enke in the germany goal , scored both goals for finland in a 2-2 draw the last time the teams met in helsinki in june 2001 .
" we always seem to get at least two strong opponents - this time russia and germany .
we know wales and azerbaijan are also strong at home , but i think we can reach the world cup if we can get good results at home against the big teams , " he told germany 's kicker magazine . dw staff / dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 10.09.2008 happy birthday , mr. lagerfeld , however old you are großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl lagerfeld is rarely seen without his trademark sunglasses dark glasses , black suits and a white ponytail : karl lagerfeld is a fashion icon .
but while his style may be timeless , the man himself is not . the german designer has been sly about his true age , claiming that he was born in 1938 and that his birth certificate was destroyed in the bombing of hamburg in the second world war .
but not everyone buys the story that lagerfeld is celebrating his 70th birthday this year .
“ there are even people who say i will turn 75 , " lagerfeld recently said , referring to rumors that he was lying about his age .
the controversy surrounding lagerfeld ’ s real age erupted in 2003 , when german tabloid newspaper bild published a copy of the iconic deisgner ’ s baptism certificate from 1933 .
it also reported that local records in lagerfeld ’ s hometown of hamburg-winterhude officially list the designer 's date of birth as september 10 , 1933 .
when a book by british journalist alicia drake added evidence to the suggestions in 2006 , it was met with fierce criticism by lagerfeld - not that he ’ s likely to be touched by this anniversary .
“ i hate birthdays , " lagerfeld told news agency dpa . although the same is true for retrospectives - lagerfeld likes to quote the jewish saying " you do n't get credit for the past " - his timeless persona is worth a look .
couture career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lagerfeld design from chanel 's 2008 collection lagerfeld has been chief designer at french fashion label chanel for 25 years .
but his glittering career has its roots in northern germany ’ s industrial upper class .
as the son of a millionaire condensed-milk magnate , lagerfeld grew up in the countryside near hamburg , shielded from the disasters of world war two . in 1953 , he moved with his mother to paris , where he showed an interest in fashion design .
in 1955 , one of lagerfeld ’ s coat designs won a competition sponsored by the international wool secretariat ; the prize was an apprenticeship at the fashion house pierre balmain .
after three years at balmain , lagerfeld moved to jean patou , where he designed two haute couture collections a year for five years .
by 1962 , lagerfeld had grown bored of working for one label and decided to launch his freelance career .
international fame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lagerfeld poses with german actress maria furtwaengler -lrb- left -rrb- and former model claudia schiffer -lrb- right -rrb- he rapidly built up a following , designing collections for labels such as tiziani , chloe , curiel and fendi .
he made news in 1983 , when he was the first german to put a haute couture collection on the runway for chanel .
his makeover brought the traditional fashion house into the 21st century .
in 1990 , he chose claudia schiffer as the new face of chanel .
the model became the fashion guru 's muse and one of germany 's most celebrated faces .
lagerfeld 's work ethic is legendary ; he spends up to 20 hours a day at his desk .
from his villas in germany , france italy and monaco , he not only steers fashions labels through the shallows of the couture market , but has earned kudos as a fashion photographer , publishing 13 books and photo collections .
he has also served as a role model for the 3d diet , which helped him lose 42 kilograms -lrb- 92 lbs . -rrb- in 2002 .
his most recent foray saw him join forces with german toy manufacturer steiff to design a limited edition teddy bear resembling himself - complete with dark glasses and a black suit .
back to the birthday karl lagerfeld has long been known to indulge his eccentricities - whether it be his love for fingerless gloves , his habit of wearing up to 26 rings at a time , or his reluctance to reveal his real date of birth .
but the designer recently announced that he will clear up the question marks surrounding 1933/1938 .
“ my birthday is somewhere in between .
but you will have to wait for my memoirs to be published before you find it out , ” lagerfeld told bild .
nothing is known about the release date of the book .

some , however , are worried the machine may mean the end of the world . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- , which was switched on at 09:30 cet on wednesday , sept .
10 after nearly two decades of construction to the tune of 6 billion swiss francs -lrb- 3.76 billion euros , $ 5.46 billion -rrb- , will help scientists understand the material that makes up the universe , according to cern -lrb- center for nuclear research -rrb- spokesman and physicist james gillies .
on wednesday , a beam of protons was successfully fired all the way around a 17-mile tunnel beneath the swiss-french border , traveling the full length of the lhc .
" we take a couple of particles , we throw them at each other , we see them smash into each other , we observe what happens and that allows us to test the way they interact with each and understand their behavior , " he said .
the work being done 100 meters beneath the ground in the lhc at cern is unique , gillies added , meaning that world 's particle physics community is looking to see what happens at the center .
hubert reeves , a french astro-physician , told the swiss daily le matin that the invention could bring " unexpected results " that would change the world of particle physics forever .
" this machine will probably bring unexpected results that could turn particle physics on its head , " reeves said .
doubts on the surface bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the rest of the cern labs be intact in the coming weeks ?
but above ground , there are doubts .
many have been made anxious by rumors that the center may produce miniature black holes .
local resident bethan montague brown said she is anxious about rumors she 's heard about the possible side effects of particle bombardment .
" i 'm not a scientist and i do n't know what all the pros and cons of black holes , but i do n't think they 're good , " she said .
" they 're talking about these black holes being very small , but i do n't know that that means .
i do n't know how big or small a black hole needs to be to swallow half the planet ... or the whole planet . "
even some scientists , like german chemistry professor otto roessler have expressed their doubts about the safety of the lhc .
he said it 's plausible that the black holes , small though they may be , could potentially " survive and grow exponentially and eat the planet from the inside . "
he is so convinced that he has filed suit at an eu court in which he says cern violates the right to life guaranteed by the european convention on human rights .
tiny black holes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : any resulting black holes wo n't be big enough to end the world , scientists said but back at cern , there are reassurances - of a kind .
while switching on the large hadron collider may create black holes , they 're sure to be harmless and are probably nothing new , said gillies .
" there are theories out there that say perhaps the lhc can produce microscopic black holes , if the lhc can do it , then cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere can do it , and cosmic rays have been hitting the atmosphere since the earth existed , " he said .
" all you can say is maybe those theories are correct , but if they are , then microscopic black holes are quite harmless . "
beyond the possible armageddon scenarios some fear will be produced at the center , more down-to-earth concerns about energy use at cern also exist .
cern has cost at least $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.1 billion euros -rrb- , and the electricity needed to power the lhg would be enough for the entire city of geneva .
yves preville , a local town councilor , said he 's not sure money at cern is being well spent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the center requires a large amount of computing power to analyze the data acquired " the physics being done here is very futuristic physics , it won ’ t have any direct application to human well being , " he said .
" the beauty is we have been able to train a great number of physicists and mathematicians , for me this is a great value . "
part of human nature nevertheless , pure scientific research does have its supporters .
geneva resident rudi schoech said he believes expecting immediate benefits form cern 's research is unrealistic .
" it 's certainly an enormous waste of money if you think you don ’ t need this kind of information , if you ca n't build anything from it , " he said .
" but i think it ’ s a very integral part of human nature , to look for things , to search for the origins of how things work . "
gillies said the part of human nature that works at discovering the unknown has led to inventions that are now essential parts of our everyday life .
the history of science is littered with scientists who say , you 'll never find any use for this , and then , 100 years after they 're dead we 're using them , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 10.09.2008 " major contributions to science " expected from lhc says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prof. wilczek believes the lhc will lead to great breakthroughs in physics as the physics world excitedly watches the first ever activation of the lhc particle collider , nobel prize laureate and mit physics professor frank wilczek told dw-world.de what scientists hope to find . how do you explain the highly emotional discussion that has been sparked by the long hadron collider project ?
well , people in general fear the unknown and that makes sense .
if you do n't understand something that 's potentially dangerous then that 's the first thing you want to know about it - is it something we should be afraid of ?
and of course scientists have an aura , still deriving from world war ii and the atomic bomb and the nuclear age , and the things they do .
this is very , very different , but people on the outside might not be able to see the fine points and the differences - but this is a completely different kind of thing from any kind of bomb building .
the other thing is that people use the same words for things that are actually quite different , like one of the main things that people were frightened about was the idea that you could produce black holes at lhc .
there are some very , very speculative ideas that suggest that you might be able to produce very , very small black holes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilczek won the nobel prize for physics in 2004 but , although we use the same word , namely black holes , for really , really small ones and really , really big ones , they are very different .
small black holes - the ones that might be produced at the lhc - are much smaller than a single atom , much smaller even than a single proton and they exert less gravity than a gram of matter , and they 're completely unstable so they live for much less than a second .
so , although we call them black holes , they 're not at all the kind of thing that might swallow you up or produce a catastrophe .
perhaps you do not so much have to convince the greater public of the safety of the project , but other scientists , like professor roessler of tuebingen for example .
why has there been no great discussion between scientists ?
oh there has !
there 's a very , very careful process that we do - and elaborate reports .
thousands of scientists worked on the lhc and there 's a community of tens of thousands with families , with the lives that they live - they do n't want to destroy the world .
if there were any real danger , believe me , you would be hearing from thousands of scientists , not just a few isolated fighters , about the potential dangers .
there 's an overwhelming scientific consensus that the thing is safe after careful study and very open discussions .
there 's no conspiracy or secrecy here , everything 's out in the open and everything has been carefully discussed .
so it gives the wrong impression to say that scientists are arguing with each other about this .
how is this experiment going to change our vision of the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc is a 27 kilometer -lrb- 17 mile -rrb- long underground ring of magnets we do n't know in detail what 's going to happen and there may be some big surprises , but i think the three kinds of ideas that look most promising to me - any one of which would be a major , major contribution to science - are the following : firstly , equations tell us that what appears to us in ordinary life as empty space is actually a material which affects the properties of matter in ways that our very successful equations tell us , but we 've never yet really broken down this material to see what it 's made out of .
so it 's as if we have been fish in an ocean , surrounded by water , and for a long time we 've taken the water for granted because it 's the only thing we know , we could n't imagine a world without it .
but then if we were smart fish we would eventually realize that we are surrounded by something that is slowing us down and changing the way we move and function , and then the next step would be to figure out what this founding medium is made out of .
that 's what the lhc is going to be able to do for the world we actually live in and the complex medium that we call empty space .
for the first time we 're going to be able to tell what kinds of things it is made out of .
this is usually called looking for the “ higgs particle , ” but it might not be one particle , it might be a whole bunch of things .
another idea is that we will be able to make more beautiful equations of physics and combine our descriptions of all the different forces of nature , that at present have separate theories , into a unified field theory .
we have very good ideas about doing this , but to do it we have to add to the equations of physics in ways that predict new phenomena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no-one knows exactly what will happen when particles collide at lhc we 're going to find out whether these ideas about unified field theory and super symmetry - which is one of the concrete ways of achieving unification - whether these ideas are right .
and if they 're right then we 'll have much more beautiful , much more powerful equations of physics that will enable us to understand things closer to the big bang .
and point three is that astronomers have recently discovered that most of the mass of the universe is not coming from the sort of matter that we 've studied in biology and chemistry - matter that 's made out of protons , neutrons , quarks , photons , electrons , these things that we understand very well now - but something new , that 's different from all those , that 's called “ dark matter , ” shows that the universe is in some form that we have n't encountered before and it interacts very , very weakly with normal matter .
now , one of the remarkable things that comes out of unifying the equations of physics is that if one of the particles in one of these ideas turns out to have the right properties to make this dark matter , and if you figure out how much of it would be produced in the big bang , it 's about right to make the amount of dark matter we actually observe .
that 's a very exciting possibility : making a connection between fundamental physics and cosmology by finding out in a laboratory experiment here on earth what dark matter is made of .
those are three ideas that i think are concrete and will be tested in the next stages , but there could also be surprises that are harder to anticipate , there are lots of more speculative ideas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes a lot of hardware to find out how the creation of the universe came about the period of experimentation has now begun , when are we going to hear about the first results ?
well this is really a big engineering step so , if all goes well , we 'll have protons circulating all around the tunnel for the first time .
it 's a milestone , but it wo n't really be a physics experiment - they 're not yet going to do collisions or study new phenomena - it 's really an engineering step to see if the machine is working properly .
experiments will really commence if all goes well next year , and when new results will come out depends on what 's there .
it also depends on how fast we can understand the technicalities of the machine and how the detectors are functioning .
so it 's hard to give a precise date , but i would expect that by this time next year we should see some very interesting results and , certainly regarding the big ideas that i mentioned , it will be clear whether we are on the right track or in serious trouble within two to three , or up to five years . interview : emilia rojas / claudia herrera-pahl -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over a three-week period , almost 500 soldiers and military representatives from around the world will participate in drills aimed at improving multinational peacekeeping operations .
two hundred and twenty of the troops are mongolian and another 100 are from the us .
representatives from thailand , nepal , france and india are also taking part .
as exercises go , these ones are relatively small - but they are symbolic .
they represent part of mongolia 's ongoing efforts to build ties that extend beyond its two super-power neighbours .
' third neighbours ' mongolia is sandwiched between china and russia , both of which have controlled it in the past .
the qing dynasty ruled mongolia for more than 200 years .
it absorbed swathes of the once-great mongolian empire , including what is now china 's inner mongolian autonomous region .
when the qing fell in 1911 , china and russia tussled over mongolia before a soviet-backed communist government took power there in the early 1920s .
mongolia functioned as a soviet satellite state and served as a buffer with china .
soviet troops were stationed in the country and policy , for the most part , mirrored moscow .
when the soviet union collapsed , mongolia shifted to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy - one which has been , in general , stable .
today , mongolia knows it must maintain close bonds with its giant neighbours , both of which are vital to the land-locked nation .
china is mongolia 's largest trading partner , followed by russia .
russia supplies almost all of mongolia 's oil , china controls its access to ports .
both are major investors and both have their eyes firmly fixed on mongolia 's mineral wealth .
but the young democracy - mindful of past subordination to moscow and china 's voracious appetite for natural resources - also sees diversifying its international ties as the best guarantee of its political and economic independence .
so it has been seeking to build new relationships , both with the west and with other asian nations , in a variety of different arenas .
mongolia calls it a " third neighbour " policy .

over a three-week period , almost 500 soldiers and military representatives from around the world will participate in drills aimed at improving multinational peacekeeping operations .
two hundred and twenty of the troops are mongolian and another 100 are from the us .
representatives from thailand , nepal , france and india are also taking part .
as exercises go , these ones are relatively small - but they are symbolic .
they represent part of mongolia 's ongoing efforts to build ties that extend beyond its two super-power neighbours .
' third neighbours ' mongolia is sandwiched between china and russia , both of which have controlled it in the past .
the qing dynasty ruled mongolia for more than 200 years .
it absorbed swathes of the once-great mongolian empire , including what is now china 's inner mongolian autonomous region .
when the qing fell in 1911 , china and russia tussled over mongolia before a soviet-backed communist government took power there in the early 1920s .
mongolia functioned as a soviet satellite state and served as a buffer with china .
soviet troops were stationed in the country and policy , for the most part , mirrored moscow .
when the soviet union collapsed , mongolia shifted to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy - one which has been , in general , stable .
today , mongolia knows it must maintain close bonds with its giant neighbours , both of which are vital to the land-locked nation .
china is mongolia 's largest trading partner , followed by russia .
russia supplies almost all of mongolia 's oil , china controls its access to ports .
both are major investors and both have their eyes firmly fixed on mongolia 's mineral wealth .
but the young democracy - mindful of past subordination to moscow and china 's voracious appetite for natural resources - also sees diversifying its international ties as the best guarantee of its political and economic independence .
so it has been seeking to build new relationships , both with the west and with other asian nations , in a variety of different arenas .
mongolia calls it a " third neighbour " policy .
" no-one denies that russia and china are the heavyweights in the region , but mongolia has resolved since the mid-1990s to embrace ' third neighbour ' countries , " said william infante , mongolia country director for the asia foundation , an ngo that promotes democracy and development .

mongolia is also actively seeking partners from across the globe to help it exploit vast copper , gold , uranium and coal deposits .

over a three-week period , almost 500 soldiers and military representatives from around the world will participate in drills aimed at improving multinational peacekeeping operations .
two hundred and twenty of the troops are mongolian and another 100 are from the us .
representatives from thailand , nepal , france and india are also taking part .
as exercises go , these ones are relatively small - but they are symbolic .
they represent part of mongolia 's ongoing efforts to build ties that extend beyond its two super-power neighbours .
' third neighbours ' mongolia is sandwiched between china and russia , both of which have controlled it in the past .
the qing dynasty ruled mongolia for more than 200 years .
it absorbed swathes of the once-great mongolian empire , including what is now china 's inner mongolian autonomous region .
when the qing fell in 1911 , china and russia tussled over mongolia before a soviet-backed communist government took power there in the early 1920s .
mongolia functioned as a soviet satellite state and served as a buffer with china .
soviet troops were stationed in the country and policy , for the most part , mirrored moscow .
when the soviet union collapsed , mongolia shifted to a free market economy and a parliamentary democracy - one which has been , in general , stable .
today , mongolia knows it must maintain close bonds with its giant neighbours , both of which are vital to the land-locked nation .
china is mongolia 's largest trading partner , followed by russia .
russia supplies almost all of mongolia 's oil , china controls its access to ports .
both are major investors and both have their eyes firmly fixed on mongolia 's mineral wealth .
but the young democracy - mindful of past subordination to moscow and china 's voracious appetite for natural resources - also sees diversifying its international ties as the best guarantee of its political and economic independence .
so it has been seeking to build new relationships , both with the west and with other asian nations , in a variety of different arenas .
mongolia calls it a " third neighbour " policy .
" no-one denies that russia and china are the heavyweights in the region , but mongolia has resolved since the mid-1990s to embrace ' third neighbour ' countries , " said william infante , mongolia country director for the asia foundation , an ngo that promotes democracy and development .
" it recognises that diverse foreign and trade relations are an element of broader stability .
so although much of their trade does come from china and russia , they are cultivating relations with a diverse field of actors . "
mining concessions to that end , mongolia has been expanding its engagement in international missions and organisations .
five years ago it sent a small deployment of troops to iraq as part of the " coalition of the willing " .
this deployment has been renewed annually ever since .
mongolia also has soldiers in afghanistan and has contributed peacekeepers to un missions in countries including dr congo and sierra leone .
it is a member of the asean regional forum -lrb- arf -rrb- and is seeking membership of the asia-pacific economic co-operation -lrb- apec -rrb- .
perhaps tellingly , though , it has never sought full membership of the shanghai cooperation organisation , a security grouping comprising russia , china and the central asian nations , and remains an observer to the group .
mongolia is also actively seeking partners from across the globe to help it exploit vast copper , gold , uranium and coal deposits .
there is no shortage of willing volunteers - countries are rushing to build ties .
several top leaders have visited mongolia in recent years three years ago president george w bush became the first us leader to visit mongolia .
the prime minister of japan , mongolia 's largest aid donor , followed a year later , then the australian foreign minister .
canada is soon to open an embassy there .
trade delegates from eu nations are frequent visitors , while multinationals are already on the ground .
australia 's rio tinto and canada 's ivanhoe mines are awaiting final approval on a $ 3bn deal to develop copper deposits in the south gobi region .
there are problems - the country is still in the process of establishing institutions to manage its resources and ensure they benefit its 2.7 million people .
corruption is a concern , and political battles have prevented deals from moving forward .
investors are worried about a new windfall tax and the issue of state participation in key projects .
but in terms of policy , mr infante says , the door is open to all .
" it is unlikely that the balance would shift away from a policy of diverse foreign investment , " he said .
" i do n't see any country has a monopoly or disproportionate role at the expense of others . "
' bottom line ' earlier this month russian president dmitry medvedev said his country would seek to maintain privileged interests in countries that it considered within its sphere of influence .
so could mongolia 's " third neighbour " policy put it on a collision course with former masters ?
no , says dr kerry brown of uk think-tank chatham house .
mongolia may want to expand its ties but it knows where to stop .
" the mongolians are being realistic with their diplomacy and building good , positive links throughout the world , " he said .
" but they know the bottom line - they can get as friendly as they like with the eu and the west , but if any kind of conflict or tension came they would be on their own . "
and maintaining the status quo is in the interests of all sides ; he does not anticipate any serious conflicts arising .
mr infante agrees .
the circumstances are different , he says , both in terms of regional issues and foreign policy .
" i do n't think that mongolia has any fear that russia would impede in its own expression of national security , " he said .
so the drills taking place at the five hills training centre near ulan bator are not going to trigger an international incident .
in fact , russia and china both have observers there .
but they do represent the will of mongolia to become a useful partner - and in doing so to set its modern-day identity in stone .

volunteers are planting thousands of reeds in the newport wetlands to encourage migratory birds .
the 10,000 plants will go around a recently-built visitor centre and will give the illusion the building is floating on the reed beds .
the site was built as compensation for loss of the mudflats when the cardiff barrage was built .
shelducks , wigeons and teals are among the migratory birds that spend winter at the reserve .
the area , recently granted national nature reserve status , used to be the storage lagoons for pulverised ash from the neighbouring uskmouth power station .
it is now home to many species of bird and it is also the place to find a range of wildlife , including many species of orchids , butterflies and dragonflies .
to encourage more feathered visitors a team of up to 20 volunteers will spend the day planting the reeds .
observation centre the wildlife charity rspb hopes it is only a matter of time before the birds and other wildlife move in and visitors will be able to observe them from the centre itself .
the plants have been grown at the rspb 's langford lowfields reserve in nottinghamshire , from seeds collected at newport wetlands in january .
jonathan cook from the centre said : " the wet weather has been no obstacle to the wading birds on the reserve in the winter , they thrive on a wet environment .
" our new reed beds will be great for visitors , as people will be able to view the birds through binoculars and telescopes from inside the comfort of the centre , even over a hot chocolate ! "
the newport wetlands reserve is owned and managed by the countryside council for wales which has entered into a partnership with newport city council and the rspb to develop the visitor and education facilities at the site .

volunteers are planting thousands of reeds in the newport wetlands to encourage migratory birds .
the 10,000 plants will go around a recently-built visitor centre and will give the illusion the building is floating on the reed beds .
the site was built as compensation for loss of the mudflats when the cardiff barrage was built .
shelducks , wigeons and teals are among the migratory birds that spend winter at the reserve .
the area , recently granted national nature reserve status , used to be the storage lagoons for pulverised ash from the neighbouring uskmouth power station .
it is now home to many species of bird and it is also the place to find a range of wildlife , including many species of orchids , butterflies and dragonflies .
to encourage more feathered visitors a team of up to 20 volunteers will spend the day planting the reeds .
observation centre the wildlife charity rspb hopes it is only a matter of time before the birds and other wildlife move in and visitors will be able to observe them from the centre itself .
the plants have been grown at the rspb 's langford lowfields reserve in nottinghamshire , from seeds collected at newport wetlands in january .
jonathan cook from the centre said : " the wet weather has been no obstacle to the wading birds on the reserve in the winter , they thrive on a wet environment .
" our new reed beds will be great for visitors , as people will be able to view the birds through binoculars and telescopes from inside the comfort of the centre , even over a hot chocolate ! "
the newport wetlands reserve is owned and managed by the countryside council for wales which has entered into a partnership with newport city council and the rspb to develop the visitor and education facilities at the site .

powys council is plunging 9,380 of its 14,000 lamps into darkness .
the decision was made after it was realised the council 's £ 500,000 lighting bill was set to rise by £ 175,000 .
the first phase is affecting a number of areas in the south of the county including parts of llandrindod wells and rhayader .
two out of three lights in non-sensitive areas are being switched off as the council attempts to manage its power budget following increases in energy costs .
but locations covered by cctv , pedestrian crossings and trunk roads , will not be affected by the move .
carbon footprint councillor gwilym evans , who is responsible for street lights , said : " the -lrb- council 's governing -rrb- board decided that the only way to keep within budget with the scale of increases was to switch off the majority of lights in some areas .
" that work has now started . "
the project could also cut the council 's carbon footprint by up to 1,100 tonnes a year and reduce night sky pollution .
officials had planned to shutdown 5,000 lights this year , and 6,400 in 2009 .
however , following a re-think they decided to increase the tally because they faced an overspend on energy costs of £ 43,000 .

powys council is plunging 9,380 of its 14,000 lamps into darkness .
the decision was made after it was realised the council 's £ 500,000 lighting bill was set to rise by £ 175,000 .
the first phase is affecting a number of areas in the south of the county including parts of llandrindod wells and rhayader .
two out of three lights in non-sensitive areas are being switched off as the council attempts to manage its power budget following increases in energy costs .
but locations covered by cctv , pedestrian crossings and trunk roads , will not be affected by the move .
carbon footprint councillor gwilym evans , who is responsible for street lights , said : " the -lrb- council 's governing -rrb- board decided that the only way to keep within budget with the scale of increases was to switch off the majority of lights in some areas .
" that work has now started . "
the project could also cut the council 's carbon footprint by up to 1,100 tonnes a year and reduce night sky pollution .
officials had planned to shutdown 5,000 lights this year , and 6,400 in 2009 .
however , following a re-think they decided to increase the tally because they faced an overspend on energy costs of £ 43,000 .

the edwardian structure , built in 1910 , burned down after a fire started in the early hours of tuesday .
it is thought to have started in a former pub and cafe near the front of the pier on the main road .
the police are still waiting to be told the structure is stable and it is safe to carry out an inquiry into whether the fire was started deliberately .
further examinations will also be made to try to establish whether the structure can be saved .
it is still not known if the metal pillars and concrete which forms the base of the pier could possibly be restored .
' golden age ' about 60 firefighters tackled the blaze by pumping water from a boating lake a mile away to help control the blaze .
the attraction was first built in 1910 - the last to be constructed in the " golden age " of pier building .
it was built with a promenade deck and 600ft long jetty with an ornate oriental-style pavilion , which opened to the public in 1911 .
the pier was sold to a lancashire businessman for about £ 500,000 last year .
mike simmons , also known as comedian joey blower , wanted to convert it into luxury apartments but his plans faced some local opposition .
the blaze comes less than six weeks after a fire destroyed the 104-year-old pier in the somerset resort of weston-super-mare in july .

picture courtesy of andy wilson investigations are continuing into the cause of a fire which destroyed a historic lancashire pier .
the edwardian structure , built in 1910 , burned down after a fire started in the early hours of tuesday .
it is thought to have started in a former pub and cafe near the front of the pier on the main road .
the police are still waiting to be told the structure is stable and it is safe to carry out an inquiry into whether the fire was started deliberately .
further examinations will also be made to try to establish whether the structure can be saved .
it is still not known if the metal pillars and concrete which forms the base of the pier could possibly be restored .
' golden age ' about 60 firefighters tackled the blaze by pumping water from a boating lake a mile away to help control the blaze .
the attraction was first built in 1910 - the last to be constructed in the " golden age " of pier building .
it was built with a promenade deck and 600ft long jetty with an ornate oriental-style pavilion , which opened to the public in 1911 .
the pier was sold to a lancashire businessman for about £ 500,000 last year .
mike simmons , also known as comedian joey blower , wanted to convert it into luxury apartments but his plans faced some local opposition .

picture courtesy of andy wilson investigations are continuing into the cause of a fire which destroyed a historic lancashire pier .
the edwardian structure , built in 1910 , burned down after a fire started in the early hours of tuesday .
it is thought to have started in a former pub and cafe near the front of the pier on the main road .
the police are still waiting to be told the structure is stable and it is safe to carry out an inquiry into whether the fire was started deliberately .
further examinations will also be made to try to establish whether the structure can be saved .
it is still not known if the metal pillars and concrete which forms the base of the pier could possibly be restored .
' golden age ' about 60 firefighters tackled the blaze by pumping water from a boating lake a mile away to help control the blaze .
the attraction was first built in 1910 - the last to be constructed in the " golden age " of pier building .
it was built with a promenade deck and 600ft long jetty with an ornate oriental-style pavilion , which opened to the public in 1911 .
the pier was sold to a lancashire businessman for about £ 500,000 last year .
mike simmons , also known as comedian joey blower , wanted to convert it into luxury apartments but his plans faced some local opposition .
the blaze comes less than six weeks after a fire destroyed the 104-year-old pier in the somerset resort of weston-super-mare in july .

they 've all been given the " freedom " of a particular city , town or borough in wales , and olympic silver medallist david davies has joined their ranks .
the swimmer has been awarded the freedom of barry for services to the seaside town over the last six years .
but other than providing winners with a day out and a certificate , what does it mean in practical terms ?
for davies , dubbed dai splash , the freedom of barry wo n't allow him to do much in practical terms .
it does not carry any ancient rights , such as the freedom to graze sheep .
and unfortunately it wo n't guarantee him a free pint in his local pub - aptly named the dolphin - although there are sure to be plenty lining up to buy him one .
however , it is the highest honour the town council can bestow on a person .
in davies 's case it was felt he had already contributed eminent services as an ambassador for the town despite being only 23 .
on tuesday evening he was honoured with a civic ceremony and dinner and presented with a scroll - the first time the honour has been bestowed in 53 years .
freemen and women in wales newport : field marshall sir bernard law montgomery , mary ann hart , aubrey hames , merchant navy association swansea : jimmy carter , hms scott , william gladstone , john charles cardiff : prince charles and lady diana , pope john paul ii , nelson mandela , sir tasker watkins rhondda cynon taf : stuart burrows tenby : david lloyd george , hms tenby , augustus john neath port talbot : michael sheen haverfordwest : lord nelson derek wolfe , chief executive of barry town council , said they believed it was last awarded to former mp dorothy rees in 1956 .
" it is a very special award in recognition of outstanding service - and that does n't even begin to describe what david has achieved , " he said .
" we think this award is really special and what david has achieved is very special , a superlative performance . "
" he 's also helped promote the town - he mentions barry in the statements he makes . "
contrary to popular belief , those awarded the freedom of a particular place are n't given a ceremonial key .
its origins lie in medieval times when craftsmen and women throughout europe were organised into trade guilds which required workers to sign up as freemen .
these guilds , which were a more primitive version of a trade union crossed with a trade association , would strictly regulate members .
in london , the scheme dates back to 1237 and only freemen there were allowed to vote .
there is also some evidence that they avoided bridge and other tolls .
it was actually quite a big deal when i was awarded the freedom of cardiff because i was one of the only women to have been handed the honour dame tanni grey-thompson by 1835 , the growing population made the scheme unworkable and so trade and franchise restrictions were abolished .
in cardiff , those honoured since the award began there back in 1886 include sports heroes colin jackson and dame tanni grey-thompson ; political giants like lloyd george and winston churchill and members of the royal family .
there are currently no special arrangements attached to the award although when paralympics legend dame tanni was given the honour in 2003 , it seems she was told it meant she could graze sheep in the city centre .
" my sister was egging me on to buy a sheep and test the theory but it did n't happen , " she said .
" david should definitely try grazing his sheep in barry just to see what reaction he gets !
" it was actually quite a big deal when i was awarded the freedom of cardiff because i was one of the only women to have been handed the honour .
" that kind of recognition is really nice .
i got a really beautiful certificate which was nicely framed and hung over the mantelpiece .
" we 've just moved house and that frame is one of the few things that we have kept out ready to go up .
you shall , as much as lies in your power , contribute and do every act and thing for the good government and safety of the rights and privileges of this ancient borough and the inhabitants thereof .
so help you god part of the freedom of tenby oath taken by augustus john in 1959 " we also enjoyed a really nice day out as a family because there was a civic reception and a special presentation . "
the military also do well in the " freedom " stakes across wales .
on saturday , the royal welsh marched through the streets of wrexham to celebrate being granted the honorary freedom of the county borough .
the regiment marched with their colours flying , bayonets fixed , drums beating and bands playing , sticking to the rules laid out by their honour .
for individuals , it seems a promise of duty to the town or city is required .
sir harry jones , former leader of the welsh local government association , had to promise to be obedient to the mayor of newport and its councillors and also contribute to the city when he was given the freedom of newport in 2004 .
so being given the freedom of a place is certainly a big responsibility .
although it surely ca n't be any harder than swimming in the 10km open water event in beijing .

but a pop-up box will appear on computer screens when the tracks are first played , encouraging fans to give the band their e-mail address .
keyboardist mark kelly said downloaders would be contacted with offers of gig tickets and other merchandise , to try to make some money back for the band .
" we 're willing to try new things and we want to see what happens , " he said .
" everybody 's aware of the effect of peer-to-peer file-sharing on cd sales and the music industry in general , " he told the bbc news website .
" up until recently we 've felt fairly immune to that because the fans have been really supportive of the band and , i suppose , because of the age demographic , they do tend to prefer cds to downloads . "
" people forget radiohead were still number one in the album charts " mark kelly marillion keyboardist bands have been exploring new ways to release music in recent months , with radiohead making their last album available online on a pay-what-you-like basis and prince giving his most recent cd away with a newspaper .
kelly acknowledged that making marillion 's music available for free was against his natural instinct - " we come from a long tradition of selling it " .
but he still expected fans would buy the cd version of happiness is the road when it is released on 20 october .
" people forget radiohead were still number one in the album charts , " he added .
" they also say they were n't very successful because they only got an average of £ 2 per download .
" but they would n't have got £ 2 per sale from -lsb- record company -rsb- emi , so in those terms it was actually a big success , and they still sold cds . "
' loyal fanbase ' paul williams , who edits record industry publication music week , said marillion had always been " pretty ground-breaking in terms of doing things differently and they have a very loyal fanbase " .
taking that into consideration , he said , the download plan would " probably work for them quite successfully " .
marillion have bypassed record companies in the past by asking fans to pay for albums before recording began , thereby securing funds for studio time .
" most acts these days certainly do n't make their fortunes based on the traditional way of selling recorded music , " mr williams noted .
matt phillips , director of communications for the british phonographic industry , said : " there 's nothing unlawful about peer-to-peer technology per se , and it can be a powerful distribution platform for artists and labels .
" the issue arises when that technology is used unlawfully to avoid paying for the music you download - as it is in 99.9 % of cases .

keyboardist mark kelly said downloaders would be contacted with offers of gig tickets and other merchandise , to try to make some money back for the band .
" we 're willing to try new things and we want to see what happens , " he said .
" everybody 's aware of the effect of peer-to-peer file-sharing on cd sales and the music industry in general , " he told the bbc news website .

people forget radiohead were still number one in the album charts mark kelly marillion keyboardist bands have been exploring new ways to release music in recent months , with radiohead making their last album available online on a pay-what-you-like basis and prince giving his most recent cd away with a newspaper .
kelly acknowledged that making marillion 's music available for free was against his natural instinct - " we come from a long tradition of selling it " .
but he still expected fans would buy the cd version of happiness is the road when it is released on 20 october .
" people forget radiohead were still number one in the album charts , " he added .

its new hp elitebook 6930p can be configured with an ultra-capacity battery to deliver " all-day computing " .
the firm says the 24-hour battery means travellers can take more than 10 trips on the eurostar between london and paris before recharging their laptop .
hp said it was an " unprecedented milestone in mobile computing " .
ted clark , of hp 's notebook global business unit , said : " all-day computing has been the holy grail of notebook computing .
" with the hp elitebook 6930p , customers no longer have to worry about their notebook battery running out before their work day is over . "
october release the company said the record battery life arises from a combination of hp engineering and energy-efficient notebook components such as intel solid-state hard drives -lrb- ssd -rrb- and mercury-free led displays .
the optional hp illumi-lite led display boosts battery run time by up to four hours compared to traditional lcd displays , while the intel ssd provides about a 7 % increase in battery life compared to traditional hard drives .
it is worth noting that the 24-hour figure can be reached only by purchasing the ultra-capacity battery and upgrading the base model of the 6930p to include the illumi-lite display and 80 gigabyte version of the ssd .
the company says in addition to preserving battery life , tests have also shown that the new intel ssd boosts overall performance by up to 57 % , and data transfer rates are almost six times faster than traditional hard drives .
" intel architected its new line of high-performance solid-state drives specifically to bring a new level of performance and reliability to the computing platform and make significant impact to the way people use their pcs , " said randy wilhelm of intel .
" the hp milestone is an example of the impact of this new level of performance that specifically delivers on lower power consumption for longer battery life . "
the new hp elitebook will be available in october .

october release the company said the record battery life arises from a combination of hp engineering and energy-efficient notebook components such as intel solid-state hard drives -lrb- ssd -rrb- and mercury-free led displays .
the optional hp illumi-lite led display boosts battery run time by up to four hours compared to traditional lcd displays , while the intel ssd provides about a 7 % increase in battery life compared to traditional hard drives .
it is worth noting that the 24-hour figure can be reached only by purchasing the ultra-capacity battery and upgrading the base model of the 6930p to include the illumi-lite display and 80 gigabyte version of the ssd .
the company says in addition to preserving battery life , tests have also shown that the new intel ssd boosts overall performance by up to 57 % , and data transfer rates are almost six times faster than traditional hard drives .
" intel architected its new line of high-performance solid-state drives specifically to bring a new level of performance and reliability to the computing platform and make significant impact to the way people use their pcs , " said randy wilhelm of intel .
" the hp milestone is an example of the impact of this new level of performance that specifically delivers on lower power consumption for longer battery life . "
the new hp elitebook will be available in october .

still looking sprightly , and with a tan which suggests a summer spent in a sunnier land than the uk , the star is promoting his autobiography , a compilation album plus a single , which is vying to be number one on sunday .
sir cliff - he received his knighthood in 1995 - has spent the past few days signing books for thousands of fans who had queued for a chance to meet their idol .
and a weekend of newspaper headlines and speculation about his sexuality accompanied the serialisation of the book , particularly his description of a " companion " , a male former priest with whom he shares a home . "
i 've spent two or three days now correcting the crap that some of the media have done " sir cliff richard while he describes the press as " uncontrollable " , he admits he is " so grateful that after 50 years , they still find me interesting enough to write things " .
" they still purposely make things sound wrong .
by taking paragraphs on one topic and putting them together with paragraphs on another topic , they 're lying by omission .
" but i do n't fear them , " sir cliff insists .
" they have no control over me .
in a way i do n't care what they say as long as they keep on saying it .
" i can always correct it .
i 've spent two or three days now correcting the crap that some of the media have done . "
but the publicity has done no harm in terms of sales for my life , my way - it has gone straight in at number one on the non-fiction book chart .
and debuting in the top spot is something he hopes to do in the singles chart on sunday , with thank you for a lifetime .
if he can knock katy perry 's i kissed a girl from the summit , sir cliff will have had number ones in six consecutive decades .
" i think fans will receive it well because it 's really a song for them .
it 's really me saying - as the title suggests - thank you for a lifetime . "
being number one would be " nice " , he says , but he reckons no act will ever overtake his five-decade haul of chart-toppers anyway .
" who 's going to do that ? " he asks .
" many of them barely make five years . "
' terrific ingenuity ' looking back at his career , he remembers the 1960s as " a fantastic time " .
" everything was new and fresh .
technology had arrived in about the mid- ' 50s and by the time the beatles came in , we could link four-track machines instead of performing in mono .
" the beatles could be very creative and the ingenuity they showed was terrific ; absolutely fantastic sounds and great songs . "
he came second in the eurovision song contest in 1968 with congratulations - in may it was claimed the vote was rigged and sir cliff should have won - but he says times have changed since that performance , and his subsequent appearance in 1973 .
" i watch eurovision when i can , but i watch it mostly to find out what terry is going to say , because some of that music does n't rate at all for me . "
the terry to whom he refers is irish broadcaster sir terry wogan , who indicated he would quit as a bbc commentator after a " debacle " regarding the voting in this year 's event . "
can you imagine if elton -lsb- john -rsb- had done candle in the wind ?
he 'd have walked away with it " sir cliff richard on the early days of eurovision the presenter was unhappy that several ex-soviet states all backed the eventual winner , russia , and described the show as " no longer a music contest " after the british entry came last .
" if there 's a group of countries who like a similar type of music , they 're going to vote for each other , " says sir cliff .
" they probably do n't like what we do . "
would he return to the stage if asked to salvage the uk 's wounded pride ?
" i have no desire to go back on it , " he replies .
" when i did it , i thought it could become a fantastic platform for european rock ' n ' roll .
i thought we could all have internationally-known artists performing .
" can you imagine if elton -lsb- john -rsb- had done candle in the wind ?
he 'd have walked away with it .
" if -lsb- paul -rsb- mccartney and -lsb- john -rsb- lennon had done things with their songs , we could have won it many , many times . "
and so to sir cliff 's sixth decade in the record business - and a defiant promise that he will always be his own man .
" i 've spent my life doing things that i want to do and feel like doing .
when i decide to do them , i do them as best i can . "
he acknowledges " not everyone is going to like the things i do " - but at 67 , it appears nothing is going to change him now .
sir cliff richard 's single thank you for a lifetime and his book - my life , my way - are both out now in the uk .
