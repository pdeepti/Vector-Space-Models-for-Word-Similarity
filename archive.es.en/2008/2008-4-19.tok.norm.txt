" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

after statements from prosecutors in munich earlier this month had cleared the former head of the concern 's supervisory board from corruption charges , new reports are surfacing indicating that pierer may actually have had a hand or at least knowledge of illicit payments .
reports published in the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung and the online edition of der spiegel news magazine on saturday , april 19 said von pierer had been fingered for the first time by a witness in relation to the concern 's vast corruption scandal .
according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .
argentine officials involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer stepped down as head of siemens supervisory board in 2007 the reports said evidence pointed to bribes paid to officials in the argentine interior ministry under former president carlos menem for securing a two-billion dollar contract for a system to produce electronic passports . the order was cancelled after a change of government , and an extra ten million dollars was allegedly paid through a swiss consultancy to revive the deal .
prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .
von pierer , who has always brushed aside any wrongdoing in the long-running siemens corruption saga , issued a statement through his lawyer denying the latest allegations .
the ex-siemens boss stepped down from his post in april last year amid an extensive investigation into corruption at the company .
before that , von pierer was chief executive of the engineering giant from 1992 to 2005 .
corruption scandal expands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of germany 's most prominent brands over the past year germany 's largest electrical and engineering concern has struggled with revelations that it created a slush fund to pay bribes in exchange for foreign contracts .
just this past week , seven former executives in siemens ' greek unit were summoned to testify in a corruption probe focusing on transactions related to the 2004 olympic games in athens .
the munich-based company is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states .
billions of euros in illicit payments siemens has acknowledged the existence of illicit payments worth 1.3 billion euros around the world .
in oct .
2007 , the company agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
officials for the company which makes items from light bulbs and telecommunications systems to power plants and trains said they were cooperating in all investigations and have introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent .
meanwhile german chancellor angela merkel said she planned to disband the country 's innovation council , headed by von pierer .
the ex-boss had served as technology advisor to the chancellor .
merkel said the council would be replaced by two different institutions , a technical academy in munich and the german academy of science in halle , eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : park east synagogue in new york 's upper east side although benedict has sometimes struggled with his efforts to heal the wounds of the past between the catholic church and world jewry - including most recently by reintroducing a controversial good friday prayer which calls for the conversion of jews - his visit to the synagogue helped smooth relations between the two religions .
several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "
howard rubinstein , vice-chairman of the holocaust museum in new york , also praised the pope 's gesture towards the jewish people . "
" in coming here he has made a spectacular effort to create good will between our religions and that means an awful lot , particularly in view of the suffering we had during the war and the historical relationship that existed , " rubinstein told reporters . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .

" the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .

after statements from prosecutors in munich earlier this month had cleared the former head of the concern 's supervisory board from corruption charges , new reports are surfacing indicating that pierer may actually have had a hand or at least knowledge of illicit payments .
reports published in the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung and the online edition of der spiegel news magazine on saturday , april 19 said von pierer had been fingered for the first time by a witness in relation to the concern 's vast corruption scandal .
according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .
argentine officials involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer stepped down as head of siemens supervisory board in 2007 the reports said evidence pointed to bribes paid to officials in the argentine interior ministry under former president carlos menem for securing a two-billion dollar contract for a system to produce electronic passports . the order was cancelled after a change of government , and an extra ten million dollars was allegedly paid through a swiss consultancy to revive the deal .
prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .
von pierer , who has always brushed aside any wrongdoing in the long-running siemens corruption saga , issued a statement through his lawyer denying the latest allegations .
the ex-siemens boss stepped down from his post in april last year amid an extensive investigation into corruption at the company .
before that , von pierer was chief executive of the engineering giant from 1992 to 2005 .

just this past week , seven former executives in siemens ' greek unit were summoned to testify in a corruption probe focusing on transactions related to the 2004 olympic games in athens .
the munich-based company is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states .
billions of euros in illicit payments siemens has acknowledged the existence of illicit payments worth 1.3 billion euros around the world .
in oct .
2007 , the company agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
officials for the company which makes items from light bulbs and telecommunications systems to power plants and trains said they were cooperating in all investigations and have introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent .
meanwhile german chancellor angela merkel said she planned to disband the country 's innovation council , headed by von pierer .
the ex-boss had served as technology advisor to the chancellor .
merkel said the council would be replaced by two different institutions , a technical academy in munich and the german academy of science in halle , eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .

" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .

skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .

" the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .
but for his part , sarkozy simply announced that france 's expansive atomic energy program was c02 neutral .
are these examples other countries should follow ?
how does the saying go : actions speak louder than words ?
the world is still waiting for the actions of the g8 - whether it 's the us , france or germany .
climate change in the post-bush era the only hope for the future is that the next us president will take a stronger stance on combating climate change than george w. bush .
the positions of the candidates for the white house point to a more productive era .
both democratic candidates barack obama and hillary clinton as well as the republican candidate john mccain have all come out strong in favor of setting emissions limits . helle jeppesen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after statements from prosecutors in munich earlier this month had cleared the former head of the concern 's supervisory board from corruption charges , new reports are surfacing indicating that pierer may actually have had a hand or at least knowledge of illicit payments .
reports published in the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung and the online edition of der spiegel news magazine on saturday , april 19 said von pierer had been fingered for the first time by a witness in relation to the concern 's vast corruption scandal .
according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .
argentine officials involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer stepped down as head of siemens supervisory board in 2007 the reports said evidence pointed to bribes paid to officials in the argentine interior ministry under former president carlos menem for securing a two-billion dollar contract for a system to produce electronic passports . the order was cancelled after a change of government , and an extra ten million dollars was allegedly paid through a swiss consultancy to revive the deal .
prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .
von pierer , who has always brushed aside any wrongdoing in the long-running siemens corruption saga , issued a statement through his lawyer denying the latest allegations .

the munich-based company is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states .
billions of euros in illicit payments siemens has acknowledged the existence of illicit payments worth 1.3 billion euros around the world .
in oct .
2007 , the company agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
officials for the company which makes items from light bulbs and telecommunications systems to power plants and trains said they were cooperating in all investigations and have introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent .
meanwhile german chancellor angela merkel said she planned to disband the country 's innovation council , headed by von pierer .
the ex-boss had served as technology advisor to the chancellor .
merkel said the council would be replaced by two different institutions , a technical academy in munich and the german academy of science in halle , eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .

" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .

skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .

" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

the slovenian presidency , however , added that " contacts with him him -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- on other levels were not excluded . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .
at the time , rupel said that inviting the dalai lama to brussels was " doable " but would need to be discussed by foreign ministers from the other eu nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 19.04.2008 opinion : climate conference is a lesson in irresponsibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combating global warming was the stated focus of the major economies meeting in paris on april 17 and 18 , but according to dw 's helle jeppesen , the conference did n't deserve the designation " climate conference . " the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .
but for his part , sarkozy simply announced that france 's expansive atomic energy program was c02 neutral .
are these examples other countries should follow ?
how does the saying go : actions speak louder than words ?
the world is still waiting for the actions of the g8 - whether it 's the us , france or germany .
climate change in the post-bush era the only hope for the future is that the next us president will take a stronger stance on combating climate change than george w. bush .
the positions of the candidates for the white house point to a more productive era .
both democratic candidates barack obama and hillary clinton as well as the republican candidate john mccain have all come out strong in favor of setting emissions limits . helle jeppesen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after statements from prosecutors in munich earlier this month had cleared the former head of the concern 's supervisory board from corruption charges , new reports are surfacing indicating that pierer may actually have had a hand or at least knowledge of illicit payments .
reports published in the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung and the online edition of der spiegel news magazine on saturday , april 19 said von pierer had been fingered for the first time by a witness in relation to the concern 's vast corruption scandal .
according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .
argentine officials involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer stepped down as head of siemens supervisory board in 2007 the reports said evidence pointed to bribes paid to officials in the argentine interior ministry under former president carlos menem for securing a two-billion dollar contract for a system to produce electronic passports . the order was cancelled after a change of government , and an extra ten million dollars was allegedly paid through a swiss consultancy to revive the deal .
prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .
von pierer , who has always brushed aside any wrongdoing in the long-running siemens corruption saga , issued a statement through his lawyer denying the latest allegations .
the ex-siemens boss stepped down from his post in april last year amid an extensive investigation into corruption at the company .
before that , von pierer was chief executive of the engineering giant from 1992 to 2005 .
corruption scandal expands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of germany 's most prominent brands over the past year germany 's largest electrical and engineering concern has struggled with revelations that it created a slush fund to pay bribes in exchange for foreign contracts .
just this past week , seven former executives in siemens ' greek unit were summoned to testify in a corruption probe focusing on transactions related to the 2004 olympic games in athens .
the munich-based company is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states .
billions of euros in illicit payments siemens has acknowledged the existence of illicit payments worth 1.3 billion euros around the world .
in oct .
2007 , the company agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
officials for the company which makes items from light bulbs and telecommunications systems to power plants and trains said they were cooperating in all investigations and have introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent .
meanwhile german chancellor angela merkel said she planned to disband the country 's innovation council , headed by von pierer .
the ex-boss had served as technology advisor to the chancellor .
merkel said the council would be replaced by two different institutions , a technical academy in munich and the german academy of science in halle , eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : park east synagogue in new york 's upper east side although benedict has sometimes struggled with his efforts to heal the wounds of the past between the catholic church and world jewry - including most recently by reintroducing a controversial good friday prayer which calls for the conversion of jews - his visit to the synagogue helped smooth relations between the two religions .
several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "
howard rubinstein , vice-chairman of the holocaust museum in new york , also praised the pope 's gesture towards the jewish people . "
" in coming here he has made a spectacular effort to create good will between our religions and that means an awful lot , particularly in view of the suffering we had during the war and the historical relationship that existed , " rubinstein told reporters . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : park east synagogue in new york 's upper east side although benedict has sometimes struggled with his efforts to heal the wounds of the past between the catholic church and world jewry - including most recently by reintroducing a controversial good friday prayer which calls for the conversion of jews - his visit to the synagogue helped smooth relations between the two religions .
several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "
howard rubinstein , vice-chairman of the holocaust museum in new york , also praised the pope 's gesture towards the jewish people . "
" in coming here he has made a spectacular effort to create good will between our religions and that means an awful lot , particularly in view of the suffering we had during the war and the historical relationship that existed , " rubinstein told reporters . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache agriculture -pipe- 19.04.2008 german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's agricultural minister wants a farming renaissance in europe german agriculture minister horst seehofer has called for a drastic rise in european agricultural production , in a reverse of the bloc 's previous agricultural policy , to counter rising world food prices and shortages . " we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .

" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .

skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

after statements from prosecutors in munich earlier this month had cleared the former head of the concern 's supervisory board from corruption charges , new reports are surfacing indicating that pierer may actually have had a hand or at least knowledge of illicit payments .
reports published in the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung and the online edition of der spiegel news magazine on saturday , april 19 said von pierer had been fingered for the first time by a witness in relation to the concern 's vast corruption scandal .
according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .
argentine officials involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer stepped down as head of siemens supervisory board in 2007 the reports said evidence pointed to bribes paid to officials in the argentine interior ministry under former president carlos menem for securing a two-billion dollar contract for a system to produce electronic passports . the order was cancelled after a change of government , and an extra ten million dollars was allegedly paid through a swiss consultancy to revive the deal .
prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .
von pierer , who has always brushed aside any wrongdoing in the long-running siemens corruption saga , issued a statement through his lawyer denying the latest allegations .
the ex-siemens boss stepped down from his post in april last year amid an extensive investigation into corruption at the company .
before that , von pierer was chief executive of the engineering giant from 1992 to 2005 .
corruption scandal expands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of germany 's most prominent brands over the past year germany 's largest electrical and engineering concern has struggled with revelations that it created a slush fund to pay bribes in exchange for foreign contracts .
just this past week , seven former executives in siemens ' greek unit were summoned to testify in a corruption probe focusing on transactions related to the 2004 olympic games in athens .
the munich-based company is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states .
billions of euros in illicit payments siemens has acknowledged the existence of illicit payments worth 1.3 billion euros around the world .
in oct .
2007 , the company agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .

the slovenian presidency , however , added that " contacts with him him -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- on other levels were not excluded . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .
at the time , rupel said that inviting the dalai lama to brussels was " doable " but would need to be discussed by foreign ministers from the other eu nations .

on friday , rupel received special chinese envoy guan chengyuan , who had a letter laying out beijing 's position on developments in tibet and eu nations ' reaction to them .
in response , rupel said that " substantive and open dialog with the dalai lama could form part of the solution " to the problem , according to the statement .
" slovenia and the eu understand the urgency of restoring stability in china , but at the same time believe that the chinese authorities could take more positive steps to address the situation in tibet , " the eu presidency said .

protests were held in beijing , hefei and in wuhan in the central chinese province of hubei , in qingdao in shandong province and in kunming in the south-west province of yunnan , xinhua news agency reported .
anti-french sentiment in china has been on the rise since the chaotic paris leg of the olympic torch relay , where pro-tibet protesters tried to wrestle the flame from jin jing , a young wheelchair-bound fencer .
the resentment has been amplified by french president nicolas sarkozy linking his appearance at the olympic games opening ceremony to progress on human rights in tibet , following china 's crackdown in the region .

exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have died in the crackdown .
china says tibetan " rioters " have killed 18 civilians and two policemen .
rupel said that the eu was " concerned " about the lack of information about the events and reports from international non-governmental organizations of harsh measures by the authorities and that many people remained unaccounted for .
" the eu is concerned upon receiving such information , " rupel said .

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .

" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .
" the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after statements from prosecutors in munich earlier this month had cleared the former head of the concern 's supervisory board from corruption charges , new reports are surfacing indicating that pierer may actually have had a hand or at least knowledge of illicit payments .
reports published in the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung and the online edition of der spiegel news magazine on saturday , april 19 said von pierer had been fingered for the first time by a witness in relation to the concern 's vast corruption scandal .
according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .
argentine officials involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer stepped down as head of siemens supervisory board in 2007 the reports said evidence pointed to bribes paid to officials in the argentine interior ministry under former president carlos menem for securing a two-billion dollar contract for a system to produce electronic passports . the order was cancelled after a change of government , and an extra ten million dollars was allegedly paid through a swiss consultancy to revive the deal .
prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .
von pierer , who has always brushed aside any wrongdoing in the long-running siemens corruption saga , issued a statement through his lawyer denying the latest allegations .
the ex-siemens boss stepped down from his post in april last year amid an extensive investigation into corruption at the company .
before that , von pierer was chief executive of the engineering giant from 1992 to 2005 .
corruption scandal expands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of germany 's most prominent brands over the past year germany 's largest electrical and engineering concern has struggled with revelations that it created a slush fund to pay bribes in exchange for foreign contracts .
just this past week , seven former executives in siemens ' greek unit were summoned to testify in a corruption probe focusing on transactions related to the 2004 olympic games in athens .
the munich-based company is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states .
billions of euros in illicit payments siemens has acknowledged the existence of illicit payments worth 1.3 billion euros around the world .
in oct .
2007 , the company agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
officials for the company which makes items from light bulbs and telecommunications systems to power plants and trains said they were cooperating in all investigations and have introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent .
meanwhile german chancellor angela merkel said she planned to disband the country 's innovation council , headed by von pierer .
the ex-boss had served as technology advisor to the chancellor .
merkel said the council would be replaced by two different institutions , a technical academy in munich and the german academy of science in halle , eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .

several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "
howard rubinstein , vice-chairman of the holocaust museum in new york , also praised the pope 's gesture towards the jewish people . "

" the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .
but for his part , sarkozy simply announced that france 's expansive atomic energy program was c02 neutral .

on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .

speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : park east synagogue in new york 's upper east side although benedict has sometimes struggled with his efforts to heal the wounds of the past between the catholic church and world jewry - including most recently by reintroducing a controversial good friday prayer which calls for the conversion of jews - his visit to the synagogue helped smooth relations between the two religions .
several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "
howard rubinstein , vice-chairman of the holocaust museum in new york , also praised the pope 's gesture towards the jewish people . "

french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache agriculture -pipe- 19.04.2008 german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's agricultural minister wants a farming renaissance in europe german agriculture minister horst seehofer has called for a drastic rise in european agricultural production , in a reverse of the bloc 's previous agricultural policy , to counter rising world food prices and shortages . " we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .
" the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .
at the time , rupel said that inviting the dalai lama to brussels was " doable " but would need to be discussed by foreign ministers from the other eu nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 19.04.2008 opinion : climate conference is a lesson in irresponsibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combating global warming was the stated focus of the major economies meeting in paris on april 17 and 18 , but according to dw 's helle jeppesen , the conference did n't deserve the designation " climate conference . " the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .
but for his part , sarkozy simply announced that france 's expansive atomic energy program was c02 neutral .
are these examples other countries should follow ?
how does the saying go : actions speak louder than words ?
the world is still waiting for the actions of the g8 - whether it 's the us , france or germany .
climate change in the post-bush era the only hope for the future is that the next us president will take a stronger stance on combating climate change than george w. bush .
the positions of the candidates for the white house point to a more productive era .
both democratic candidates barack obama and hillary clinton as well as the republican candidate john mccain have all come out strong in favor of setting emissions limits . helle jeppesen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : park east synagogue in new york 's upper east side although benedict has sometimes struggled with his efforts to heal the wounds of the past between the catholic church and world jewry - including most recently by reintroducing a controversial good friday prayer which calls for the conversion of jews - his visit to the synagogue helped smooth relations between the two religions .
several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "
howard rubinstein , vice-chairman of the holocaust museum in new york , also praised the pope 's gesture towards the jewish people . "
" in coming here he has made a spectacular effort to create good will between our religions and that means an awful lot , particularly in view of the suffering we had during the war and the historical relationship that existed , " rubinstein told reporters . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slovenian presidency , however , added that " contacts with him him -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- on other levels were not excluded . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .
at the time , rupel said that inviting the dalai lama to brussels was " doable " but would need to be discussed by foreign ministers from the other eu nations .
beijing 's opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel spoke to a chinese envoy in ljubljana china has opposed foreign nations providing support to what it has said was the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , in reaction to reports that he may go to japan and europe .
on friday , rupel received special chinese envoy guan chengyuan , who had a letter laying out beijing 's position on developments in tibet and eu nations ' reaction to them .
in response , rupel said that " substantive and open dialog with the dalai lama could form part of the solution " to the problem , according to the statement .
" slovenia and the eu understand the urgency of restoring stability in china , but at the same time believe that the chinese authorities could take more positive steps to address the situation in tibet , " the eu presidency said .
protests in china meanwhile , protests were held on saturday in at least five chinese cities against independence for tibet , official media reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protested in front of the carrefour supermaket in wuhan , china demonstrators gathered outside branches of french retailer carrefour amid claims that it had links to exiled tibetans and in the wake of widespread calls for a boycott of french goods .
carrefour has vehemently rejected the claims .
a small group of young people protested outside the french embassy in beijing 's sanlitun district saturday and a nearby french school .
large numbers of police had earlier sealed off streets in the district .
protests were held in beijing , hefei and in wuhan in the central chinese province of hubei , in qingdao in shandong province and in kunming in the south-west province of yunnan , xinhua news agency reported .
anti-french sentiment in china has been on the rise since the chaotic paris leg of the olympic torch relay , where pro-tibet protesters tried to wrestle the flame from jin jing , a young wheelchair-bound fencer .

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .

" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .

skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .

after statements from prosecutors in munich earlier this month had cleared the former head of the concern 's supervisory board from corruption charges , new reports are surfacing indicating that pierer may actually have had a hand or at least knowledge of illicit payments .
reports published in the munich-based daily sueddeutsche zeitung and the online edition of der spiegel news magazine on saturday , april 19 said von pierer had been fingered for the first time by a witness in relation to the concern 's vast corruption scandal .
according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .
argentine officials involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer stepped down as head of siemens supervisory board in 2007 the reports said evidence pointed to bribes paid to officials in the argentine interior ministry under former president carlos menem for securing a two-billion dollar contract for a system to produce electronic passports . the order was cancelled after a change of government , and an extra ten million dollars was allegedly paid through a swiss consultancy to revive the deal .
prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .
von pierer , who has always brushed aside any wrongdoing in the long-running siemens corruption saga , issued a statement through his lawyer denying the latest allegations .
the ex-siemens boss stepped down from his post in april last year amid an extensive investigation into corruption at the company .
before that , von pierer was chief executive of the engineering giant from 1992 to 2005 .
corruption scandal expands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of germany 's most prominent brands over the past year germany 's largest electrical and engineering concern has struggled with revelations that it created a slush fund to pay bribes in exchange for foreign contracts .
just this past week , seven former executives in siemens ' greek unit were summoned to testify in a corruption probe focusing on transactions related to the 2004 olympic games in athens .
the munich-based company is also the subject of a potentially damaging probe by the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- by virtue of the fact that shares in the company are listed in the united states .
billions of euros in illicit payments siemens has acknowledged the existence of illicit payments worth 1.3 billion euros around the world .
in oct .
2007 , the company agreed to pay a fine of 201 million euros to put an end to some german legal proceedings .
officials for the company which makes items from light bulbs and telecommunications systems to power plants and trains said they were cooperating in all investigations and have introduced changes designed to make its corporate structure leaner and more transparent .
meanwhile german chancellor angela merkel said she planned to disband the country 's innovation council , headed by von pierer .
the ex-boss had served as technology advisor to the chancellor .
merkel said the council would be replaced by two different institutions , a technical academy in munich and the german academy of science in halle , eastern germany . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slovenian presidency , however , added that " contacts with him him -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- on other levels were not excluded . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .

anti-french sentiment in china has been on the rise since the chaotic paris leg of the olympic torch relay , where pro-tibet protesters tried to wrestle the flame from jin jing , a young wheelchair-bound fencer .
the resentment has been amplified by french president nicolas sarkozy linking his appearance at the olympic games opening ceremony to progress on human rights in tibet , following china 's crackdown in the region .

china says tibetan " rioters " have killed 18 civilians and two policemen .
rupel said that the eu was " concerned " about the lack of information about the events and reports from international non-governmental organizations of harsh measures by the authorities and that many people remained unaccounted for .

according to the news outlets , a siemens executive told prosecutors in munich that von pierer had ordered him and a colleague in 2002 and 2003 to make suspicious payments of some $ 10 million -lrb- 6.3 million euros -rrb- in connection with a large order from the argentine government .

prosecutors in munich , where the german electrical engineering concern has its headquarters , confirmed to deutsche presse-agentur dpa that they were in contact with von pierer .
" there was a lengthy conversation at the prosecutors ' office at the wish of herr von pierer and in the presence of his lawyer yesterday -lsb- friday -rsb- , " senior prosecutor christian schmidt-sommerfeld said .

" the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .
but for his part , sarkozy simply announced that france 's expansive atomic energy program was c02 neutral .
are these examples other countries should follow ?
how does the saying go : actions speak louder than words ?
the world is still waiting for the actions of the g8 - whether it 's the us , france or germany .
climate change in the post-bush era the only hope for the future is that the next us president will take a stronger stance on combating climate change than george w. bush .
the positions of the candidates for the white house point to a more productive era .
both democratic candidates barack obama and hillary clinton as well as the republican candidate john mccain have all come out strong in favor of setting emissions limits . helle jeppesen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 19.04.2008 opinion : climate conference is a lesson in irresponsibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combating global warming was the stated focus of the major economies meeting in paris on april 17 and 18 , but according to dw 's helle jeppesen , the conference did n't deserve the designation " climate conference . " the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .
but for his part , sarkozy simply announced that france 's expansive atomic energy program was c02 neutral .
are these examples other countries should follow ?
how does the saying go : actions speak louder than words ?
the world is still waiting for the actions of the g8 - whether it 's the us , france or germany .
climate change in the post-bush era the only hope for the future is that the next us president will take a stronger stance on combating climate change than george w. bush .
the positions of the candidates for the white house point to a more productive era .
both democratic candidates barack obama and hillary clinton as well as the republican candidate john mccain have all come out strong in favor of setting emissions limits . helle jeppesen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slovenian presidency , however , added that " contacts with him him -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- on other levels were not excluded . "

the slovenian presidency , however , added that " contacts with him him -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- on other levels were not excluded . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .

" the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .

in response , rupel said that " substantive and open dialog with the dalai lama could form part of the solution " to the problem , according to the statement .

exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have died in the crackdown .
china says tibetan " rioters " have killed 18 civilians and two policemen .
rupel said that the eu was " concerned " about the lack of information about the events and reports from international non-governmental organizations of harsh measures by the authorities and that many people remained unaccounted for .

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .

" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .

seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .

skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals illegal logging gives eu massive eco-headache agriculture -pipe- 19.04.2008 german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's agricultural minister wants a farming renaissance in europe german agriculture minister horst seehofer has called for a drastic rise in european agricultural production , in a reverse of the bloc 's previous agricultural policy , to counter rising world food prices and shortages . " we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .
" the targets for -lsb- fuel -rsb- blends must be put to the test . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : park east synagogue in new york 's upper east side although benedict has sometimes struggled with his efforts to heal the wounds of the past between the catholic church and world jewry - including most recently by reintroducing a controversial good friday prayer which calls for the conversion of jews - his visit to the synagogue helped smooth relations between the two religions .
several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "

walking side by side with a holocaust survivor into the sanctuary of new york 's part east synagogue on friday , the pontiff was greeted with a warm welcome .
" a heartfelt shalom .
willkommen , " said arthur schneier , chief rabbi of the synagogue , mingling the hebrew word for " peace " and the german word for " welcome . "
schneier , a 78-year-old austrian-born jew who survived the holocaust while watching most of his family perish , embraced the historic and symbolic meaning of the pope 's visit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi shakes hands with the congregation in the park east synagogue " your visit today … is a reaffirmation of your outreach , goodwill and commitment to enhancing jewish-catholic relations … in the last 45 years , much progress has been made , " he said echoing words spoken in washington by the pontiff , who has continued conciliatory steps taken by his predecessor john paul ii to improve relations with jews .
the visit on the eve of passover , the holy day marking the exodus from egypt , is only the third by a pope to a jewish house of worship .
benedict xvi visited a synagogue in cologne , germany , in 2005 , and his predecessor pope john paul visited one in rome in 1986 .
a gesture of friendship and respect " shalom !
it is with joy that i come here just a few hours before the celebration of your pesah -lrb- passover -rrb- , to express my respect and esteem for the jewish community of new york city , " benedict told some 400 people gathered in the 120-year-old byzantine-style synagogue .
" i encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood , " the pope said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : park east synagogue in new york 's upper east side although benedict has sometimes struggled with his efforts to heal the wounds of the past between the catholic church and world jewry - including most recently by reintroducing a controversial good friday prayer which calls for the conversion of jews - his visit to the synagogue helped smooth relations between the two religions .
several jewish leaders had criticized the prayer at the time , and the vatican issued a statement that the text " in no way intends to indicate a change in the catholic church 's regard for the jews . "
" that prayer certainly is not jew-friendly , " rabbi schneier told reporters after the papal visit .
but the message the pope sent here was clear , he added : " the leader of the catholic world standing in an american synagogue for the first time in history . "
howard rubinstein , vice-chairman of the holocaust museum in new york , also praised the pope 's gesture towards the jewish people . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 19.04.2008 opinion : climate conference is a lesson in irresponsibility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combating global warming was the stated focus of the major economies meeting in paris on april 17 and 18 , but according to dw 's helle jeppesen , the conference did n't deserve the designation " climate conference . " the two-day gathering of the world 's 16 largest economies was doomed even before it kicked off .
on the evening of the self-proclaimed " climate conference , " us president george w. bush announced the us would postpone its capping of emissions until 2025 .
his statement , which was criticized by many as too little too late , sealed the fate of the third informal climate conference , a series of meetings which bush himself had instituted amid skepticism about his environmental record .
the series of meetings are designed to prepare for the december 2009 copenhagen climate conference and to draft a successor agreement to the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
german environment minister sigmar gabriel attacked bush 's climate plans as " neanderthal " and argued that the us proposals were an inappropriate response to the global climate challenge .
more than just the us is to blame regardless of bush 's statements , the conference could not possibly have stood up to the global climate challenge , given the way it was planned and the participants who were invited .
if such a discussion on combating climate change only includes the world 's largest c02 polluters and not their victims , it can never claim to provide global solutions .
the countries which are impacted the most by global warming were never invited as participants in the conference , only those 16 biggest economies who contribute the most to the climate catastrophe .
if anything , the current crisis over rising food prices in many parts of the world shows just how vulnerable these other countries are .
climate change in the form of droughts and floods coupled with increased use of sustainable crops for the controversial production of ethanol as an alternative energy source has led to food shortages and soaring prices .
it is the poorest countries and the poorest of these populations which are hit hardest by climate change , not the largest c02 polluters .
the g8 - leading by example ?
french president nicolas sarkozy , who hosted the conference , called upon the emerging economies such as china and india to take on more responsibility in reducing greenhouse gases .
he also urged the us to finally set concrete goals and to sign on to the successor of the kyoto protocol .
but for his part , sarkozy simply announced that france 's expansive atomic energy program was c02 neutral .
are these examples other countries should follow ?
how does the saying go : actions speak louder than words ?
the world is still waiting for the actions of the g8 - whether it 's the us , france or germany .
climate change in the post-bush era the only hope for the future is that the next us president will take a stronger stance on combating climate change than george w. bush .
the positions of the candidates for the white house point to a more productive era .
both democratic candidates barack obama and hillary clinton as well as the republican candidate john mccain have all come out strong in favor of setting emissions limits . helle jeppesen -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
people found guilty of " disseminating terrorist propaganda and bomb-making expertise through the internet can therefore be prosecuted and sentenced to prison , " the justice ministers said in a joint statement .
the commission 's proposal would also allow eu law-enforcement agencies to demand cooperation from internet providers in order to identify the people making such calls and to ensure that the offending material is taken off-line .
closing gaps in prior legislation the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove said last week that some 5,000 internet sites " contribute to radicalizing young people in europe . "
in 2002 , the eu member states agreed common rules for fighting terrorism , but those rules did n't include internet-based calls to commit terrorist acts .
while some details of the proposal still need to be finalized , friday 's agreement signifies a basic level of support , making it unlikely that any member states would oppose its adoption . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slovenian presidency , however , added that " contacts with him him -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- on other levels were not excluded . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner said on april 1 that the 27 eu foreign ministers would invite the dalai lama once a decision had been made by the slovenian eu presidency .
at the time , rupel said that inviting the dalai lama to brussels was " doable " but would need to be discussed by foreign ministers from the other eu nations .
beijing 's opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel spoke to a chinese envoy in ljubljana china has opposed foreign nations providing support to what it has said was the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , in reaction to reports that he may go to japan and europe .
on friday , rupel received special chinese envoy guan chengyuan , who had a letter laying out beijing 's position on developments in tibet and eu nations ' reaction to them .
in response , rupel said that " substantive and open dialog with the dalai lama could form part of the solution " to the problem , according to the statement .
" slovenia and the eu understand the urgency of restoring stability in china , but at the same time believe that the chinese authorities could take more positive steps to address the situation in tibet , " the eu presidency said .
protests in china meanwhile , protests were held on saturday in at least five chinese cities against independence for tibet , official media reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators protested in front of the carrefour supermaket in wuhan , china demonstrators gathered outside branches of french retailer carrefour amid claims that it had links to exiled tibetans and in the wake of widespread calls for a boycott of french goods .
carrefour has vehemently rejected the claims .
a small group of young people protested outside the french embassy in beijing 's sanlitun district saturday and a nearby french school .
large numbers of police had earlier sealed off streets in the district .
protests were held in beijing , hefei and in wuhan in the central chinese province of hubei , in qingdao in shandong province and in kunming in the south-west province of yunnan , xinhua news agency reported .
anti-french sentiment in china has been on the rise since the chaotic paris leg of the olympic torch relay , where pro-tibet protesters tried to wrestle the flame from jin jing , a young wheelchair-bound fencer .
the resentment has been amplified by french president nicolas sarkozy linking his appearance at the olympic games opening ceremony to progress on human rights in tibet , following china 's crackdown in the region .
eu concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists all over the world have protested against the chinese crackdown in tibet last month , tibet saw the biggest anti-chinese protests in years on the anniversary of a 1959 uprising that sent the dalai lama fleeing into exile in india .
exiled tibetan leaders say more than 150 people have died in the crackdown .
china says tibetan " rioters " have killed 18 civilians and two policemen .
rupel said that the eu was " concerned " about the lack of information about the events and reports from international non-governmental organizations of harsh measures by the authorities and that many people remained unaccounted for .

" we need a farming renaissance , and an increase in agricultural production in germany , in the whole of the european union and , more especially , in the developing countries , " seehofer said in an interview to be published on sunday , april 20 .
speaking to the mass-circulation bild newspaper , seehofer noted that the eu had induced farmers to stop using 3.8 million hectares -lrb- 9.4 million acres -rrb- of arable land in recent years to counter surpluses in dairy , produce , wine and meat .
this land should be brought into production once more , he said .
a global problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer is against cutting agricultural subventions the united nations world food program -lrb- wfp -rrb- has estimated that food prices have risen some 55 percent since june 2007 due to rising populations , strong demand from developing countries , the use of certain crops in producing biofuels , and the increasing frequency of floods and droughts amid concern over climate change .
" we have to produce more foodstuffs worldwide in order to prevent further price jumps , " seehofer said .
with an annual population growth of 80 million people , wfp expected food demand to rise 60 percent by 2030 , according to the minister .
" we have to recognize once again that agriculture is a question of national interest in every country and not a peripheral issue , " he said .
bildunterschrift : agriculture is a matter of national interest , says seehofer what will happen to subventions ?
food prices have spiralled globally but also within the european union , which subsidizes its agricultural production .
german news weekly der spiegel reported on saturday that the german finance ministry was planning to drastically reduce agricultural subventions in view of the surging food costs .
seehofer , however , insisted that farming in europe still had to be protected .
" agricultural subventions should not be questioned at all , the way it 's happening now , " he said .
in 2006 , european farmers received 50 million euros -lrb- $ 79 million -rrb- from the eu budget , 32 million euros of which were in direct payments .
dire consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un food program has issued serious warnings about the situation in the world earlier this month , the head of the international monetary fund warned that continued high prices of key foodstuffs could have dire consequences .
" thousands , hundreds of thousands of people will be starving " and social unrest could lead to war , said dominique strauss-kahn on saturday , april 12 , at an imf meeting in washington .
skyrocketing prices of commodities like rice , wheat , corn and milk have led to riots in developing countries around the world this month , including indonesia , egypt , the philippines and haiti .
some experts and government leaders are blaming the price fluctuation on increased biofuel production , which requires a fair amount of agricultural land .
high energy prices and inflation are also seen as culprits .
it is " unacceptable for the export of agro-fuels to pose a threat to the supply situation of the very people already living in poverty , " development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul said prior to the imf meeting .

almost daily , they are launching another initiative - five hours of culture per week in schools ; 5,000 apprenticeships and a national skills academy for the creative industries ; a new leadership programme for the arts and creative partnerships between artists and schools .
then , just last week , the government announced the appointment of the first ever youth dance champion : the dancer and choreographer wayne mcgregor .
what is going on in the arts world ?
union dance company members what drives government 's sudden interest in our ' cultural industries ' at a time when corporate and private donors are also queuing up to sponsor the arts ?
and could both their interests turn out to be a mixed blessing ?
the arts council england has controversially decided to cut funding to many mainly small companies while the ' big boys ' - like the royal opera house - remain the arts council 's biggest client , due to receive £ 28.4 million of the council 's total £ 467 million budget in 2010-11 .

members of haigside allotment society in treherbert , rhondda , face eviction next week if they reject the deal with the site 's owners .
it is the third reprieve for those renting the land , including a riding school for children with disabilities .

those renting land at haigside , at the bottom of the rhigos mountain , had feared the site would close in march after the landowner served eviction notices .
they were given a reprieve on animal welfare grounds as homing pigeons , livestock and riding school ponies are kept on the site , and a new date was set for next friday .
' legal document ' john evans said they were given the offer of the six-month extension , on condition everyone agreed to vacate the land at the end of that period , during a three-hour meeting between society officials and landowner mr evans in cardiff .
he said the face-to-face meeting had been " comfortable and professional " .
john evans said : " we 're more than satisfied .
it 's very much better than being evicted next friday .
" we can stay there until the end of the growing season and it will give us time to move to somewhere else .
the deal , which would see the group stay until mid-october , is to be discussed by a society meeting on tuesday .
mr evans added : " it would become a legal document that we would have to commit to but at least this gives us time now to look more deeply to see if we can find different places . "
he said about 80 people took part in activities on the four acre -lrb- 1.6 hectare -rrb- allotments , including children using the riding school .
the society submitted a 3,600-name petition to rhondda cynon taf council calling on the local authority to protect the land .

the 2,600kg vinasat-1 was built by us manufacturer lockheed martin commercial space systems for vietnam 's post & telecommunications group -lrb- vnpt -rrb- .
vnpt 's director , long tran pham , told reuters : " more than 70 % of our country consists of forests and mountains so it is very important to have satellites to deliver telecommunications to populations living in these zones .
" people already receive television by other satellites that we lease , but now we have our own satellite . "
vinasat-1 will sit 36,000km above the indonesia-papua new guinea border .
its " footprint " will span parts of japan , australia and burma .
it is hoped some of the spare capacity on the spacecraft can be sold to neighbouring countries .
quoted by afp , vnpt vice president , lam hoang vinh , said : " other countries , like thailand and singapore , have already contacted us . "
friday 's launch was the second of the year for an ariane 5 , following the despatch of the " jules verne " freighter to the international space station in march .
a further five ariane 5 flights are expected this year .
highlights in the schedule include the launch of the european space agency 's planck and herschel orbiting telescopes ; and the terrestar-1 platform , which , at 6,700kg , will be one of the biggest commercial telecom satellites ever put in space .
next up for an ariane 5 is the british skynet 5c platform .
the satellite is part of the uk military 's £ 3.6bn -lrb- $ 7.2bn -rrb- next-generation space communications system .
