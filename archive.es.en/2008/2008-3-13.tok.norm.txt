over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .
in particular , he advocated deporting non-german juvenile delinquents . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .
in particular , he advocated deporting non-german juvenile delinquents . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de turks in germany call for more government support germany 's turkish community called on the government to change its integration policy and to pay more attention to the needs of the country 's 1.7 million turks .
it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction .
-lrb- 01.03.2008 -rrb- low rate of german-turkish marriages impedes integration many german turks are pressured to marry only within their ethnic and religious group .
but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration .
-lrb- 24.02.2008 -rrb- german chancellor rejects turkish view on integration turkish prime minister erdogan called on his compatriots living in germany not to give up their ethnicity .
chancellor angela merkel struck back by stressing the importance of integration .

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .

" erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation .

the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .
" we can do that anytime mrs. merkel wants to . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .
in particular , he advocated deporting non-german juvenile delinquents . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .
one in 10 residents worked in the book industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city hall remains a symbol of leipzig 's grand past all that changed once the third reich rose to power .
many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .
the city that had influenced publishing around the world no longer had a book trade of its own . struggling to re-establish itself after the war ended , leipzig struggled to return to its publishing heritage . " many publishing houses did n't receive licenses after 1945 , " said knopf .
" publishers either moved away , closed , or were ousted . " still , not all was lost .
the renowned german creative writing program " deutsches literaturinstitut " - known in the former east germany as the johannes r. becher institut - was founded in leipzig in 1955 .
the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads . "
alongside the more than 2,300 exhibitions from 36 countries set up at the fairgrounds , the separate festival features 1,900 author readings in 300 locations throughout the city .
from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public . " leipzig has restored its literary character while dealing with difficult economic conditions , " said oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair .
" without a doubt , these four days of the annual festival can help the city and the entire publishing sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 13.03.2008 iran heads for less than fair elections , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many faces from the opposition among the candidates president mahmoud ahmadinejad has weakened iran 's economy , but the reformist parties ca n't benefit from his mistakes in the parliamentary elections , said iranian political scientist and journalist behrouz khosrozadeh . behrouz khosrozadeh is an iranian political scientist and journalist living in germany .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him .

business and tourism leaders in berlin fear shops will be forced to close and hotels run empty as the crippling public transport strike enters day nine on thursday , march 13 , with no end in sight . " the city 's economic growth is under threat , " the head of the chamber of commerce in the german capital , jan eder , told afp news agency , one week after buses , trams and the underground first ground to a halt .
as news of the situation in the german capital spreads around the world , tourism is expected to be the first industry to feel the pinch .
" if the strike continues in weeks to come , the world will take note and the number of bookings will start to drop , " said christian taenzler , spokesman for berlin tourism marketing -lrb- btm -rrb- , in an interview with german daily die welt .
" the reliability of its public transport system has always been an asset to berlin when it comes to international marketing , " he added .
" but the strike is badly tarnishing its image . "
job losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if tourists want to see the sights , they have to do so on foot adding insult to injury , the verdi union announced earlier this week it intended to continue the strikes into the easter holidays , when visitor numbers to the city will inevitably rise .
btm 's head peter nerger has warned that up to 250,000 jobs in the tourism industry are now in peril .
shops , meanwhile , have already seen trade drop by an average 20 to 30 percent and a few businesses have reported a 50 percent loss in turnover , according to the retail federation hde .
" some stores could close if this carried on much longer , " hde spokesman hubertus pellengahr told afp .
according to the chamber of commerce , late deliveries are also proving a serious problem .
tourism , the mainstay of berlin 's economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike will soon start to affect hotel booking figures negotiating the vast german capital has become markedly more difficult for tourists without an operational tram and underground network , while tourism experts say the cancellation of the city 's number 100 bus route , which takes in many of berlin 's top attractions , is a particular blow .
that 's not all .
" the hotels and restaurants have been faced with a sharp drop in business .
it is no mystery , we all know that at the moment we do n't eat out , in fact we do n't go anywhere , " said thomas lengfelder , head of the hoga hospitality federation .
the strike is hitting berlin where it hurts .
without a significant industrial or financial sector , the city is burdened by debts of some 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 93 billion -rrb- and is well aware that tourism is its potential salvation .
the industry has been gathering momentum in recent years , with a record 7.6 million tourists visiting in 2007 .
nonetheless , surveys show that 57 percent of berliners are sympathetic to the strikers , with support stronger in the east of the city than in the west and most pronounced among the younger generation . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

job losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if tourists want to see the sights , they have to do so on foot adding insult to injury , the verdi union announced earlier this week it intended to continue the strikes into the easter holidays , when visitor numbers to the city will inevitably rise .
btm 's head peter nerger has warned that up to 250,000 jobs in the tourism industry are now in peril .
shops , meanwhile , have already seen trade drop by an average 20 to 30 percent and a few businesses have reported a 50 percent loss in turnover , according to the retail federation hde .
" some stores could close if this carried on much longer , " hde spokesman hubertus pellengahr told afp .
according to the chamber of commerce , late deliveries are also proving a serious problem .
tourism , the mainstay of berlin 's economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike will soon start to affect hotel booking figures negotiating the vast german capital has become markedly more difficult for tourists without an operational tram and underground network , while tourism experts say the cancellation of the city 's number 100 bus route , which takes in many of berlin 's top attractions , is a particular blow .
that 's not all .
" the hotels and restaurants have been faced with a sharp drop in business .
it is no mystery , we all know that at the moment we do n't eat out , in fact we do n't go anywhere , " said thomas lengfelder , head of the hoga hospitality federation .
the strike is hitting berlin where it hurts .
without a significant industrial or financial sector , the city is burdened by debts of some 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 93 billion -rrb- and is well aware that tourism is its potential salvation .
the industry has been gathering momentum in recent years , with a record 7.6 million tourists visiting in 2007 .
nonetheless , surveys show that 57 percent of berliners are sympathetic to the strikers , with support stronger in the east of the city than in the west and most pronounced among the younger generation . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany .

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation .

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 13.03.2008 iran heads for less than fair elections , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many faces from the opposition among the candidates president mahmoud ahmadinejad has weakened iran 's economy , but the reformist parties ca n't benefit from his mistakes in the parliamentary elections , said iranian political scientist and journalist behrouz khosrozadeh . behrouz khosrozadeh is an iranian political scientist and journalist living in germany .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

both issues continue to divide the bloc 's members . a pivotal united nations meeting on climate change is more than a year away , but in the slow-paced world of brussels bureaucracy , that 's very , very soon . the european union has said it wants to take a leading role in the november 2009 global climate change discussions , which will try to settle on a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
but first the 27-nation bloc has to come up with its own energy policy reforms . the eu is feeling the pressure , as significant agreements between members still exist .
the bloc wants to liberalize the eu 's energy market by june 2008 and have a comprehensive policy approved by december 2008 . " the momentum can not be allowed to slip , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday .
" the timing of an agreement is critical to its success . " energy issues remain contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso worries about losing momentum energy policy reforms as well as a french proposal for a mediterranean union top the eu heads of state 's agendas during their regular gathering in brussels on thursday and friday . while the eu passed a historic agreement last year to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , the bloc now has to decide how to reach its goals .
they also want 20 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources such as wind , solar , hydro and wave power within the next 12 years . by the end of 2008 the eu wants to outline specific steps needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy and biofuel . but the devil is in the details .
germany has resisted efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars , saying it would hurt the country 's politically influential automobile industry .
and countries can also not agree on whether to break up europe 's power companies . there 's also concern that the eu 's measures to fight global warming might result in driving heavy industry out of europe .
barroso promised special guarantees for energy-hungry industries such as steel , cement and aluminum .

both issues continue to divide the bloc 's members . a pivotal united nations meeting on climate change is more than a year away , but in the slow-paced world of brussels bureaucracy , that 's very , very soon . the european union has said it wants to take a leading role in the november 2009 global climate change discussions , which will try to settle on a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
but first the 27-nation bloc has to come up with its own energy policy reforms . the eu is feeling the pressure , as significant agreements between members still exist .
the bloc wants to liberalize the eu 's energy market by june 2008 and have a comprehensive policy approved by december 2008 . " the momentum can not be allowed to slip , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday .
" the timing of an agreement is critical to its success . " energy issues remain contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso worries about losing momentum energy policy reforms as well as a french proposal for a mediterranean union top the eu heads of state 's agendas during their regular gathering in brussels on thursday and friday . while the eu passed a historic agreement last year to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , the bloc now has to decide how to reach its goals .
they also want 20 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources such as wind , solar , hydro and wave power within the next 12 years . by the end of 2008 the eu wants to outline specific steps needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy and biofuel . but the devil is in the details .
germany has resisted efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars , saying it would hurt the country 's politically influential automobile industry .
and countries can also not agree on whether to break up europe 's power companies . there 's also concern that the eu 's measures to fight global warming might result in driving heavy industry out of europe .
barroso promised special guarantees for energy-hungry industries such as steel , cement and aluminum . " it would be a crucial error to view the interests of european industry as being contrary to combating climate change , " he said . sarkozy to seek eu backing for " club med " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't always so friendly between these two french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are expected to explain plans to create a " mediterranean union " in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 13.03.2008 iran heads for less than fair elections , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many faces from the opposition among the candidates president mahmoud ahmadinejad has weakened iran 's economy , but the reformist parties ca n't benefit from his mistakes in the parliamentary elections , said iranian political scientist and journalist behrouz khosrozadeh . behrouz khosrozadeh is an iranian political scientist and journalist living in germany .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .
in particular , he advocated deporting non-german juvenile delinquents . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation . " you could see that he was simply very ashamed of what had happened , " she said .
the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .
in 2001 , he is said to have taken up work again as a pastor in the community and to have supervised youth groups although he was forbidden form working with young people . the charges say the priest invited children and youths to his cellar where they were allowed to smoke a water pipe and drink alcohol .
he stands accused of making improper sexual advances to young altar boys during several excursions and at his home . diocese failed to stop tainted priest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller is under fire the case has stirred anger in the region with many outraged at the perceived failure of the authorities to prevent the priest from taking up work in the parish and seeking contact with altar boys .
around a dozen people demonstrated outside the courthouse on thursday , protesting against regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller for reinstating the priest despite his prior conviction . the court on thursday found that the diocese of regensburg had failed to adequately inform the public about the sex abuse scandal surrounding the cleric . the diocese had initially said the priest was back at work only in 2004 after he completed therapy .
but files seized by the police showed that the diocese leadership was well-informed about the clergyman 's work in the parish .
after the death of his predecessor , the accused was the responsible priest in the parish during his parole . regensburg 's state attorney said there was a strong risk of the priest repeating the sexual offences if he did not undergo therapy . recurring problem long a taboo topic , cases of pedophilia among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not become involved in the riekofen affair . the diocese of regensburg has been shaken by a number of sex abuse cases in past years . in 2002 , the conference of bishops in germany issued guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .

" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration .

the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany .

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .
one in 10 residents worked in the book industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city hall remains a symbol of leipzig 's grand past all that changed once the third reich rose to power .
many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .
the city that had influenced publishing around the world no longer had a book trade of its own . struggling to re-establish itself after the war ended , leipzig struggled to return to its publishing heritage . " many publishing houses did n't receive licenses after 1945 , " said knopf .
" publishers either moved away , closed , or were ousted . " still , not all was lost .
the renowned german creative writing program " deutsches literaturinstitut " - known in the former east germany as the johannes r. becher institut - was founded in leipzig in 1955 .
the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads . "
alongside the more than 2,300 exhibitions from 36 countries set up at the fairgrounds , the separate festival features 1,900 author readings in 300 locations throughout the city .
from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public . " leipzig has restored its literary character while dealing with difficult economic conditions , " said oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair .
" without a doubt , these four days of the annual festival can help the city and the entire publishing sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 13.03.2008 spate of data suits highlights german privacy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german courts have recently issued several verdicts protecting the right to privacy data-protection advocates lauded germany 's highest court for its decision to stop the widespread surveillance of automobile license plates .
but some said the ruling did n't go far enough . german court decisions of late - most recently one on license-plate surveillance - have brought the ongoing debate between civil libertarians and those who advocate tighter national security , back into the spotlight . in a ruling on tuesday , march 11 , the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe nixed the interior ministry 's plans to keep track of where cars travel . the court said indiscriminate license-plate checks in the states of hesse and schleswig-holstein were unconstitutional because they were carried out area-wide and without specific cause . privacy activists welcomed the court 's move to curb the state 's appetite for gathering personal data about its citizens .
but some say they are worried about how frequently the constitution is being tested . decision follows spyware debacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording where all cars are headed amounted to too much surveillance for the court the lawyer for the plaintiffs argued that automatic checking of license plates was equivalent to " complete surveillance " of a large and arbitrary section of the general population . it was the second case of late which saw the constitutional court reining in federal security agencies and politicians keen to boost security in europe , after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . in late february , germany 's highest court ruled against a law which allowed widespread computer searches using " trojan " spy software in the state north rhine-westphalia . the court defended privacy in its decision , saying such searches could only be allowed if there is evidence that " legally protected interests , " like human lives or state property , are in danger .
that decision signified the establishment of a new kind of basic right , judges said at the time . privacy activists lauded the rulings - with reservations . politicians are misguided , critic says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minsiter schaeuble is behind many measures " basically , we welcomed the court 's decision , but it could have gone farther , " said florian glatzner , a spokesman for foebus , a public-interest nonprofit that fights for data protection .
" we would have preferred if they also decided on a new basic law that says everyone has a right to move around without being observed . " the real problem with the legal battles is that individuals have to keep fighting for their constitutional rights in the first place , glatzner said . instead of just " trying to boost their political profiles " by enacting laws and then waiting for a court challenge , politicians should determine whether or not a law is constitutional in the first place , he argued . " the politicians are being shown that by first enacting laws and then seeing whether or not they are unconstitutional is the wrong way to go , " glatzner said . data-retention ruling outstanding the justices at the federal constitutional court are expected to hand down a decision before the end of april on the controversial practice of data-retention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer use makes people " transparent " under a law that went into effect on jan .
1 , phone companies are required to keep records of the time and date of all phone calls , e-mails , text messages and faxes for six months .
in the case of a legal prosecution , they would be obliged to provide the information to authorities . the law came about in the wake of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . essential tool against terror - or political device ? proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november 2007 when the law was passed , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was intended to enhance the detection of terrorist plots and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the christian democratic union , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said at the time . however , glatzner argued that targeting the general public , rather than suspected criminals , was unlikely to help in the fight against terrorism . dangers of eroding rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu security got serious after 191 died in madrid " monitoring people who are not under suspicion of any wrongdoing is the wrong way to go about it , " he said .
" they should first have a suspect , and then do the monitoring . " terrorists can be skilled in getting around the technical restrictions , but such rulings end up limiting personal freedom of everyday folks , glatzner added . " if people feel they are being observed , then they may not do something they would otherwise do , " he said .

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .
one in 10 residents worked in the book industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city hall remains a symbol of leipzig 's grand past all that changed once the third reich rose to power .
many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .
the city that had influenced publishing around the world no longer had a book trade of its own . struggling to re-establish itself after the war ended , leipzig struggled to return to its publishing heritage . " many publishing houses did n't receive licenses after 1945 , " said knopf .
" publishers either moved away , closed , or were ousted . " still , not all was lost .
the renowned german creative writing program " deutsches literaturinstitut " - known in the former east germany as the johannes r. becher institut - was founded in leipzig in 1955 .
the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads . "
alongside the more than 2,300 exhibitions from 36 countries set up at the fairgrounds , the separate festival features 1,900 author readings in 300 locations throughout the city .
from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public . " leipzig has restored its literary character while dealing with difficult economic conditions , " said oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair .
" without a doubt , these four days of the annual festival can help the city and the entire publishing sector . " this year 's book fair and book festival take place from march 13-16 , 2008 . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation . " you could see that he was simply very ashamed of what had happened , " she said .
the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .
in 2001 , he is said to have taken up work again as a pastor in the community and to have supervised youth groups although he was forbidden form working with young people . the charges say the priest invited children and youths to his cellar where they were allowed to smoke a water pipe and drink alcohol .
he stands accused of making improper sexual advances to young altar boys during several excursions and at his home . diocese failed to stop tainted priest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller is under fire the case has stirred anger in the region with many outraged at the perceived failure of the authorities to prevent the priest from taking up work in the parish and seeking contact with altar boys .
around a dozen people demonstrated outside the courthouse on thursday , protesting against regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller for reinstating the priest despite his prior conviction . the court on thursday found that the diocese of regensburg had failed to adequately inform the public about the sex abuse scandal surrounding the cleric . the diocese had initially said the priest was back at work only in 2004 after he completed therapy .
but files seized by the police showed that the diocese leadership was well-informed about the clergyman 's work in the parish .
after the death of his predecessor , the accused was the responsible priest in the parish during his parole . regensburg 's state attorney said there was a strong risk of the priest repeating the sexual offences if he did not undergo therapy . recurring problem long a taboo topic , cases of pedophilia among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not become involved in the riekofen affair . the diocese of regensburg has been shaken by a number of sex abuse cases in past years . in 2002 , the conference of bishops in germany issued guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .
one in 10 residents worked in the book industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city hall remains a symbol of leipzig 's grand past all that changed once the third reich rose to power .
many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .
the city that had influenced publishing around the world no longer had a book trade of its own . struggling to re-establish itself after the war ended , leipzig struggled to return to its publishing heritage . " many publishing houses did n't receive licenses after 1945 , " said knopf .
" publishers either moved away , closed , or were ousted . " still , not all was lost .
the renowned german creative writing program " deutsches literaturinstitut " - known in the former east germany as the johannes r. becher institut - was founded in leipzig in 1955 .
the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads . "
alongside the more than 2,300 exhibitions from 36 countries set up at the fairgrounds , the separate festival features 1,900 author readings in 300 locations throughout the city .
from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public . " leipzig has restored its literary character while dealing with difficult economic conditions , " said oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair .
" without a doubt , these four days of the annual festival can help the city and the entire publishing sector . " this year 's book fair and book festival take place from march 13-16 , 2008 . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 13.03.2008 europe wrangles over energy policy as deadlines loom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has to figure out how to put its climate proposals into action as european union leaders gather in brussels on thursday , march 13 , energy policy reforms and a proposed mediterranean union will top the agenda .
both issues continue to divide the bloc 's members . a pivotal united nations meeting on climate change is more than a year away , but in the slow-paced world of brussels bureaucracy , that 's very , very soon . the european union has said it wants to take a leading role in the november 2009 global climate change discussions , which will try to settle on a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
but first the 27-nation bloc has to come up with its own energy policy reforms . the eu is feeling the pressure , as significant agreements between members still exist .
the bloc wants to liberalize the eu 's energy market by june 2008 and have a comprehensive policy approved by december 2008 . " the momentum can not be allowed to slip , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday .
" the timing of an agreement is critical to its success . " energy issues remain contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso worries about losing momentum energy policy reforms as well as a french proposal for a mediterranean union top the eu heads of state 's agendas during their regular gathering in brussels on thursday and friday . while the eu passed a historic agreement last year to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , the bloc now has to decide how to reach its goals .
they also want 20 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources such as wind , solar , hydro and wave power within the next 12 years . by the end of 2008 the eu wants to outline specific steps needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy and biofuel . but the devil is in the details .
germany has resisted efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars , saying it would hurt the country 's politically influential automobile industry .
and countries can also not agree on whether to break up europe 's power companies . there 's also concern that the eu 's measures to fight global warming might result in driving heavy industry out of europe .
barroso promised special guarantees for energy-hungry industries such as steel , cement and aluminum . " it would be a crucial error to view the interests of european industry as being contrary to combating climate change , " he said . sarkozy to seek eu backing for " club med " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't always so friendly between these two french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are expected to explain plans to create a " mediterranean union " in july .
the plan caused a rift between the two countries , which diplomats say has been settled . the union would promote trade and cooperation with the eu 's southern neighbors .
sarkozy has also suggested that it might be a better way to include turkey in the eu policies rather than offering ankara full membership . germany had worried that northern eu countries would be left out of the new union .
there 's also concern in berlin that france is trying to use the mediterranean union to counter the influence germany has gained since 10 mainly central european nations joined the eu in 2004 . sarkozy , who is set to outline his proposal over dinner at the summit on thursday , was warned against pushing the idea too hard . " if the eu is divided by the mediterranean union , that would be a very bad message on the eve of the french presidency , " of the european union , said martin schulz , the socialist bloc leader at the european parliament .
" that would lead to france 's isolation , which we certainly do not want . " france takes over the eu 's rotating presidency from slovenia on july 1 . will anyone want to join ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is enthused about the mediterranean union the barcelona process was launched in 1995 as a way to improve political , economic and social ties to states in the mediterranean region .
but it has been held hostage by confrontations between israel and arab countries . " if the mediterranean union is a reinforcement of the barcelona process , then we completely agree , but this enterprise must remain within the framework of the european union , " schulz added . a number of eu countries have , however , expressed doubts about the project and concerns over how it will be financed .
a unanimous vote to create the new alliance would be required for eu funds to be used . even if eu leaders do agree , it would still need the support from partner countries , who have not expressed large amount of interest in the idea . faltering markets also on agenda barroso also spoke out wednesday against protectionism as a response to the economic rough patch caused by the downfall of the global markets .
europe is a huge winner from globalization , barroso said , and remained at the top of the list as a world trading power . " europe needs to protect , but it must avoid the temptation of becoming protectionist , " he said .
" a retreat into protectionism would be madness . " but protectionism is on the minds of eu leaders .
they are expected to endorse a global voluntary code of conduct for sovereign wealth funds and to call for more transparency in the financial markets at the meeting this week . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation . " you could see that he was simply very ashamed of what had happened , " she said .
the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .
in 2001 , he is said to have taken up work again as a pastor in the community and to have supervised youth groups although he was forbidden form working with young people . the charges say the priest invited children and youths to his cellar where they were allowed to smoke a water pipe and drink alcohol .
he stands accused of making improper sexual advances to young altar boys during several excursions and at his home . diocese failed to stop tainted priest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller is under fire the case has stirred anger in the region with many outraged at the perceived failure of the authorities to prevent the priest from taking up work in the parish and seeking contact with altar boys .
around a dozen people demonstrated outside the courthouse on thursday , protesting against regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller for reinstating the priest despite his prior conviction . the court on thursday found that the diocese of regensburg had failed to adequately inform the public about the sex abuse scandal surrounding the cleric . the diocese had initially said the priest was back at work only in 2004 after he completed therapy .
but files seized by the police showed that the diocese leadership was well-informed about the clergyman 's work in the parish .
after the death of his predecessor , the accused was the responsible priest in the parish during his parole . regensburg 's state attorney said there was a strong risk of the priest repeating the sexual offences if he did not undergo therapy . recurring problem long a taboo topic , cases of pedophilia among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not become involved in the riekofen affair . the diocese of regensburg has been shaken by a number of sex abuse cases in past years . in 2002 , the conference of bishops in germany issued guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .

many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .

the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads .

from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public . " leipzig has restored its literary character while dealing with difficult economic conditions , " said oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 13.03.2008 iran heads for less than fair elections , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many faces from the opposition among the candidates president mahmoud ahmadinejad has weakened iran 's economy , but the reformist parties ca n't benefit from his mistakes in the parliamentary elections , said iranian political scientist and journalist behrouz khosrozadeh . behrouz khosrozadeh is an iranian political scientist and journalist living in germany .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .
in particular , he advocated deporting non-german juvenile delinquents . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation . " you could see that he was simply very ashamed of what had happened , " she said .
the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .
in 2001 , he is said to have taken up work again as a pastor in the community and to have supervised youth groups although he was forbidden form working with young people . the charges say the priest invited children and youths to his cellar where they were allowed to smoke a water pipe and drink alcohol .
he stands accused of making improper sexual advances to young altar boys during several excursions and at his home . diocese failed to stop tainted priest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller is under fire the case has stirred anger in the region with many outraged at the perceived failure of the authorities to prevent the priest from taking up work in the parish and seeking contact with altar boys .
around a dozen people demonstrated outside the courthouse on thursday , protesting against regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller for reinstating the priest despite his prior conviction . the court on thursday found that the diocese of regensburg had failed to adequately inform the public about the sex abuse scandal surrounding the cleric . the diocese had initially said the priest was back at work only in 2004 after he completed therapy .
but files seized by the police showed that the diocese leadership was well-informed about the clergyman 's work in the parish .
after the death of his predecessor , the accused was the responsible priest in the parish during his parole . regensburg 's state attorney said there was a strong risk of the priest repeating the sexual offences if he did not undergo therapy . recurring problem long a taboo topic , cases of pedophilia among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not become involved in the riekofen affair . the diocese of regensburg has been shaken by a number of sex abuse cases in past years . in 2002 , the conference of bishops in germany issued guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .
one in 10 residents worked in the book industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city hall remains a symbol of leipzig 's grand past all that changed once the third reich rose to power .
many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .
the city that had influenced publishing around the world no longer had a book trade of its own . struggling to re-establish itself after the war ended , leipzig struggled to return to its publishing heritage . " many publishing houses did n't receive licenses after 1945 , " said knopf .
" publishers either moved away , closed , or were ousted . " still , not all was lost .
the renowned german creative writing program " deutsches literaturinstitut " - known in the former east germany as the johannes r. becher institut - was founded in leipzig in 1955 .
the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads . "
alongside the more than 2,300 exhibitions from 36 countries set up at the fairgrounds , the separate festival features 1,900 author readings in 300 locations throughout the city .
from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public .

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .
one in 10 residents worked in the book industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city hall remains a symbol of leipzig 's grand past all that changed once the third reich rose to power .
many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .
the city that had influenced publishing around the world no longer had a book trade of its own . struggling to re-establish itself after the war ended , leipzig struggled to return to its publishing heritage . " many publishing houses did n't receive licenses after 1945 , " said knopf .
" publishers either moved away , closed , or were ousted . " still , not all was lost .
the renowned german creative writing program " deutsches literaturinstitut " - known in the former east germany as the johannes r. becher institut - was founded in leipzig in 1955 .
the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads . "
alongside the more than 2,300 exhibitions from 36 countries set up at the fairgrounds , the separate festival features 1,900 author readings in 300 locations throughout the city .
from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public . " leipzig has restored its literary character while dealing with difficult economic conditions , " said oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair .
" without a doubt , these four days of the annual festival can help the city and the entire publishing sector . " this year 's book fair and book festival take place from march 13-16 , 2008 . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but first the 27-nation bloc has to come up with its own energy policy reforms . the eu is feeling the pressure , as significant agreements between members still exist .
the bloc wants to liberalize the eu 's energy market by june 2008 and have a comprehensive policy approved by december 2008 . " the momentum can not be allowed to slip , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday .
" the timing of an agreement is critical to its success . " energy issues remain contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso worries about losing momentum energy policy reforms as well as a french proposal for a mediterranean union top the eu heads of state 's agendas during their regular gathering in brussels on thursday and friday . while the eu passed a historic agreement last year to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , the bloc now has to decide how to reach its goals .
they also want 20 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources such as wind , solar , hydro and wave power within the next 12 years . by the end of 2008 the eu wants to outline specific steps needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy and biofuel . but the devil is in the details .
germany has resisted efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars , saying it would hurt the country 's politically influential automobile industry .
and countries can also not agree on whether to break up europe 's power companies . there 's also concern that the eu 's measures to fight global warming might result in driving heavy industry out of europe .

the plan caused a rift between the two countries , which diplomats say has been settled . the union would promote trade and cooperation with the eu 's southern neighbors .
sarkozy has also suggested that it might be a better way to include turkey in the eu policies rather than offering ankara full membership . germany had worried that northern eu countries would be left out of the new union .
there 's also concern in berlin that france is trying to use the mediterranean union to counter the influence germany has gained since 10 mainly central european nations joined the eu in 2004 . sarkozy , who is set to outline his proposal over dinner at the summit on thursday , was warned against pushing the idea too hard . " if the eu is divided by the mediterranean union , that would be a very bad message on the eve of the french presidency , " of the european union , said martin schulz , the socialist bloc leader at the european parliament .

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany .

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation . " you could see that he was simply very ashamed of what had happened , " she said .
the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .
in 2001 , he is said to have taken up work again as a pastor in the community and to have supervised youth groups although he was forbidden form working with young people . the charges say the priest invited children and youths to his cellar where they were allowed to smoke a water pipe and drink alcohol .
he stands accused of making improper sexual advances to young altar boys during several excursions and at his home . diocese failed to stop tainted priest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller is under fire the case has stirred anger in the region with many outraged at the perceived failure of the authorities to prevent the priest from taking up work in the parish and seeking contact with altar boys .
around a dozen people demonstrated outside the courthouse on thursday , protesting against regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller for reinstating the priest despite his prior conviction . the court on thursday found that the diocese of regensburg had failed to adequately inform the public about the sex abuse scandal surrounding the cleric . the diocese had initially said the priest was back at work only in 2004 after he completed therapy .
but files seized by the police showed that the diocese leadership was well-informed about the clergyman 's work in the parish .
after the death of his predecessor , the accused was the responsible priest in the parish during his parole . regensburg 's state attorney said there was a strong risk of the priest repeating the sexual offences if he did not undergo therapy . recurring problem long a taboo topic , cases of pedophilia among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not become involved in the riekofen affair . the diocese of regensburg has been shaken by a number of sex abuse cases in past years . in 2002 , the conference of bishops in germany issued guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation .

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .
" we can do that anytime mrs. merkel wants to . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both issues continue to divide the bloc 's members . a pivotal united nations meeting on climate change is more than a year away , but in the slow-paced world of brussels bureaucracy , that 's very , very soon . the european union has said it wants to take a leading role in the november 2009 global climate change discussions , which will try to settle on a replacement for the kyoto protocol .
but first the 27-nation bloc has to come up with its own energy policy reforms . the eu is feeling the pressure , as significant agreements between members still exist .
the bloc wants to liberalize the eu 's energy market by june 2008 and have a comprehensive policy approved by december 2008 . " the momentum can not be allowed to slip , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on wednesday .
" the timing of an agreement is critical to its success . " energy issues remain contentious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso worries about losing momentum energy policy reforms as well as a french proposal for a mediterranean union top the eu heads of state 's agendas during their regular gathering in brussels on thursday and friday . while the eu passed a historic agreement last year to cut emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , the bloc now has to decide how to reach its goals .
they also want 20 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources such as wind , solar , hydro and wave power within the next 12 years . by the end of 2008 the eu wants to outline specific steps needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy and biofuel . but the devil is in the details .
germany has resisted efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars , saying it would hurt the country 's politically influential automobile industry .
and countries can also not agree on whether to break up europe 's power companies . there 's also concern that the eu 's measures to fight global warming might result in driving heavy industry out of europe .
barroso promised special guarantees for energy-hungry industries such as steel , cement and aluminum . " it would be a crucial error to view the interests of european industry as being contrary to combating climate change , " he said . sarkozy to seek eu backing for " club med " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are n't always so friendly between these two french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are expected to explain plans to create a " mediterranean union " in july .
the plan caused a rift between the two countries , which diplomats say has been settled . the union would promote trade and cooperation with the eu 's southern neighbors .
sarkozy has also suggested that it might be a better way to include turkey in the eu policies rather than offering ankara full membership . germany had worried that northern eu countries would be left out of the new union .
there 's also concern in berlin that france is trying to use the mediterranean union to counter the influence germany has gained since 10 mainly central european nations joined the eu in 2004 . sarkozy , who is set to outline his proposal over dinner at the summit on thursday , was warned against pushing the idea too hard . " if the eu is divided by the mediterranean union , that would be a very bad message on the eve of the french presidency , " of the european union , said martin schulz , the socialist bloc leader at the european parliament .
" that would lead to france 's isolation , which we certainly do not want . " france takes over the eu 's rotating presidency from slovenia on july 1 . will anyone want to join ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is enthused about the mediterranean union the barcelona process was launched in 1995 as a way to improve political , economic and social ties to states in the mediterranean region .
but it has been held hostage by confrontations between israel and arab countries . " if the mediterranean union is a reinforcement of the barcelona process , then we completely agree , but this enterprise must remain within the framework of the european union , " schulz added . a number of eu countries have , however , expressed doubts about the project and concerns over how it will be financed .
a unanimous vote to create the new alliance would be required for eu funds to be used . even if eu leaders do agree , it would still need the support from partner countries , who have not expressed large amount of interest in the idea . faltering markets also on agenda barroso also spoke out wednesday against protectionism as a response to the economic rough patch caused by the downfall of the global markets .
europe is a huge winner from globalization , barroso said , and remained at the top of the list as a world trading power . " europe needs to protect , but it must avoid the temptation of becoming protectionist , " he said .
" a retreat into protectionism would be madness . " but protectionism is on the minds of eu leaders .
they are expected to endorse a global voluntary code of conduct for sovereign wealth funds and to call for more transparency in the financial markets at the meeting this week . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .

" erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .
" we can do that anytime mrs. merkel wants to . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they also want 20 percent of electricity to come from renewable sources such as wind , solar , hydro and wave power within the next 12 years . by the end of 2008 the eu wants to outline specific steps needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy and biofuel . but the devil is in the details .
germany has resisted efforts to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars , saying it would hurt the country 's politically influential automobile industry .

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .
in particular , he advocated deporting non-german juvenile delinquents . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 13.03.2008 spate of data suits highlights german privacy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german courts have recently issued several verdicts protecting the right to privacy data-protection advocates lauded germany 's highest court for its decision to stop the widespread surveillance of automobile license plates .
but some said the ruling did n't go far enough . german court decisions of late - most recently one on license-plate surveillance - have brought the ongoing debate between civil libertarians and those who advocate tighter national security , back into the spotlight . in a ruling on tuesday , march 11 , the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe nixed the interior ministry 's plans to keep track of where cars travel . the court said indiscriminate license-plate checks in the states of hesse and schleswig-holstein were unconstitutional because they were carried out area-wide and without specific cause . privacy activists welcomed the court 's move to curb the state 's appetite for gathering personal data about its citizens .
but some say they are worried about how frequently the constitution is being tested . decision follows spyware debacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording where all cars are headed amounted to too much surveillance for the court the lawyer for the plaintiffs argued that automatic checking of license plates was equivalent to " complete surveillance " of a large and arbitrary section of the general population . it was the second case of late which saw the constitutional court reining in federal security agencies and politicians keen to boost security in europe , after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . in late february , germany 's highest court ruled against a law which allowed widespread computer searches using " trojan " spy software in the state north rhine-westphalia . the court defended privacy in its decision , saying such searches could only be allowed if there is evidence that " legally protected interests , " like human lives or state property , are in danger .
that decision signified the establishment of a new kind of basic right , judges said at the time . privacy activists lauded the rulings - with reservations . politicians are misguided , critic says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minsiter schaeuble is behind many measures " basically , we welcomed the court 's decision , but it could have gone farther , " said florian glatzner , a spokesman for foebus , a public-interest nonprofit that fights for data protection .
" we would have preferred if they also decided on a new basic law that says everyone has a right to move around without being observed . " the real problem with the legal battles is that individuals have to keep fighting for their constitutional rights in the first place , glatzner said . instead of just " trying to boost their political profiles " by enacting laws and then waiting for a court challenge , politicians should determine whether or not a law is constitutional in the first place , he argued . " the politicians are being shown that by first enacting laws and then seeing whether or not they are unconstitutional is the wrong way to go , " glatzner said . data-retention ruling outstanding the justices at the federal constitutional court are expected to hand down a decision before the end of april on the controversial practice of data-retention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer use makes people " transparent " under a law that went into effect on jan .
1 , phone companies are required to keep records of the time and date of all phone calls , e-mails , text messages and faxes for six months .
in the case of a legal prosecution , they would be obliged to provide the information to authorities . the law came about in the wake of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . essential tool against terror - or political device ? proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november 2007 when the law was passed , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was intended to enhance the detection of terrorist plots and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the christian democratic union , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said at the time . however , glatzner argued that targeting the general public , rather than suspected criminals , was unlikely to help in the fight against terrorism . dangers of eroding rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu security got serious after 191 died in madrid " monitoring people who are not under suspicion of any wrongdoing is the wrong way to go about it , " he said .
" they should first have a suspect , and then do the monitoring . " terrorists can be skilled in getting around the technical restrictions , but such rulings end up limiting personal freedom of everyday folks , glatzner added . " if people feel they are being observed , then they may not do something they would otherwise do , " he said .

but some said the ruling did n't go far enough . german court decisions of late - most recently one on license-plate surveillance - have brought the ongoing debate between civil libertarians and those who advocate tighter national security , back into the spotlight . in a ruling on tuesday , march 11 , the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe nixed the interior ministry 's plans to keep track of where cars travel . the court said indiscriminate license-plate checks in the states of hesse and schleswig-holstein were unconstitutional because they were carried out area-wide and without specific cause . privacy activists welcomed the court 's move to curb the state 's appetite for gathering personal data about its citizens .
but some say they are worried about how frequently the constitution is being tested . decision follows spyware debacle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recording where all cars are headed amounted to too much surveillance for the court the lawyer for the plaintiffs argued that automatic checking of license plates was equivalent to " complete surveillance " of a large and arbitrary section of the general population . it was the second case of late which saw the constitutional court reining in federal security agencies and politicians keen to boost security in europe , after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states . in late february , germany 's highest court ruled against a law which allowed widespread computer searches using " trojan " spy software in the state north rhine-westphalia . the court defended privacy in its decision , saying such searches could only be allowed if there is evidence that " legally protected interests , " like human lives or state property , are in danger .
that decision signified the establishment of a new kind of basic right , judges said at the time . privacy activists lauded the rulings - with reservations . politicians are misguided , critic says bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minsiter schaeuble is behind many measures " basically , we welcomed the court 's decision , but it could have gone farther , " said florian glatzner , a spokesman for foebus , a public-interest nonprofit that fights for data protection .
" we would have preferred if they also decided on a new basic law that says everyone has a right to move around without being observed . " the real problem with the legal battles is that individuals have to keep fighting for their constitutional rights in the first place , glatzner said . instead of just " trying to boost their political profiles " by enacting laws and then waiting for a court challenge , politicians should determine whether or not a law is constitutional in the first place , he argued . " the politicians are being shown that by first enacting laws and then seeing whether or not they are unconstitutional is the wrong way to go , " glatzner said . data-retention ruling outstanding the justices at the federal constitutional court are expected to hand down a decision before the end of april on the controversial practice of data-retention . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : computer use makes people " transparent " under a law that went into effect on jan .
1 , phone companies are required to keep records of the time and date of all phone calls , e-mails , text messages and faxes for six months .
in the case of a legal prosecution , they would be obliged to provide the information to authorities . the law came about in the wake of an eu directive forged in reaction to the terrorist attacks on trains in madrid in march 2004 , in which 191 people died .
the perpetrators were tracked down using mobile telephone data .
the law is meant to be used to fight terrorism and serious crime . essential tool against terror - or political device ? proponents of the law argue that it is an essential tool to hunt down terrorists .
speaking in november 2007 when the law was passed , german justice minister brigitte zypries emphasized that the bill was intended to enhance the detection of terrorist plots and other serious crimes all over europe . siegfried kauder , a parliamentarian and member of the christian democratic union , said those who evoked horrors of an orwellian surveillance state were playing down the importance of domestic security . " we do n't want transparent people , we want transparent criminals , " kauder said at the time . however , glatzner argued that targeting the general public , rather than suspected criminals , was unlikely to help in the fight against terrorism . dangers of eroding rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu security got serious after 191 died in madrid " monitoring people who are not under suspicion of any wrongdoing is the wrong way to go about it , " he said .
" they should first have a suspect , and then do the monitoring . " terrorists can be skilled in getting around the technical restrictions , but such rulings end up limiting personal freedom of everyday folks , glatzner added . " if people feel they are being observed , then they may not do something they would otherwise do , " he said .
" nothing illegal - but maybe they would n't go to a political demonstration , because they would be afraid of being put under pressure . " jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .

the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .
criticism of this authority is getting louder and louder . interview : hussein habibi send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business and tourism leaders in berlin fear shops will be forced to close and hotels run empty as the crippling public transport strike enters day nine on thursday , march 13 , with no end in sight . " the city 's economic growth is under threat , " the head of the chamber of commerce in the german capital , jan eder , told afp news agency , one week after buses , trams and the underground first ground to a halt .
as news of the situation in the german capital spreads around the world , tourism is expected to be the first industry to feel the pinch .
" if the strike continues in weeks to come , the world will take note and the number of bookings will start to drop , " said christian taenzler , spokesman for berlin tourism marketing -lrb- btm -rrb- , in an interview with german daily die welt .
" the reliability of its public transport system has always been an asset to berlin when it comes to international marketing , " he added .
" but the strike is badly tarnishing its image . "
job losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if tourists want to see the sights , they have to do so on foot adding insult to injury , the verdi union announced earlier this week it intended to continue the strikes into the easter holidays , when visitor numbers to the city will inevitably rise .
btm 's head peter nerger has warned that up to 250,000 jobs in the tourism industry are now in peril .
shops , meanwhile , have already seen trade drop by an average 20 to 30 percent and a few businesses have reported a 50 percent loss in turnover , according to the retail federation hde .
" some stores could close if this carried on much longer , " hde spokesman hubertus pellengahr told afp .
according to the chamber of commerce , late deliveries are also proving a serious problem .
tourism , the mainstay of berlin 's economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the strike will soon start to affect hotel booking figures negotiating the vast german capital has become markedly more difficult for tourists without an operational tram and underground network , while tourism experts say the cancellation of the city 's number 100 bus route , which takes in many of berlin 's top attractions , is a particular blow .
that 's not all .
" the hotels and restaurants have been faced with a sharp drop in business .
it is no mystery , we all know that at the moment we do n't eat out , in fact we do n't go anywhere , " said thomas lengfelder , head of the hoga hospitality federation .
the strike is hitting berlin where it hurts .
without a significant industrial or financial sector , the city is burdened by debts of some 60 billion euros -lrb- $ 93 billion -rrb- and is well aware that tourism is its potential salvation .
the industry has been gathering momentum in recent years , with a record 7.6 million tourists visiting in 2007 .
nonetheless , surveys show that 57 percent of berliners are sympathetic to the strikers , with support stronger in the east of the city than in the west and most pronounced among the younger generation . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation . " you could see that he was simply very ashamed of what had happened , " she said .
the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .
in 2001 , he is said to have taken up work again as a pastor in the community and to have supervised youth groups although he was forbidden form working with young people . the charges say the priest invited children and youths to his cellar where they were allowed to smoke a water pipe and drink alcohol .
he stands accused of making improper sexual advances to young altar boys during several excursions and at his home . diocese failed to stop tainted priest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller is under fire the case has stirred anger in the region with many outraged at the perceived failure of the authorities to prevent the priest from taking up work in the parish and seeking contact with altar boys .
around a dozen people demonstrated outside the courthouse on thursday , protesting against regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller for reinstating the priest despite his prior conviction . the court on thursday found that the diocese of regensburg had failed to adequately inform the public about the sex abuse scandal surrounding the cleric . the diocese had initially said the priest was back at work only in 2004 after he completed therapy .
but files seized by the police showed that the diocese leadership was well-informed about the clergyman 's work in the parish .
after the death of his predecessor , the accused was the responsible priest in the parish during his parole . regensburg 's state attorney said there was a strong risk of the priest repeating the sexual offences if he did not undergo therapy . recurring problem long a taboo topic , cases of pedophilia among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not become involved in the riekofen affair . the diocese of regensburg has been shaken by a number of sex abuse cases in past years . in 2002 , the conference of bishops in germany issued guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .

the victim was 11 years old at the time the assaults began . he was sentenced to three years in prision and confinement in a psychiatric clinic . the trial opened with the priest confessing to the crime , saying he wanted to spare his victim from giving a statement . " i once again would like to stress that i want to apologize in particular to my joint plaintiff , " the cleric said .
before the trial began , the accused handed the victim 's family 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,750 -rrb- in cash and said he would offer a further 3,000 euros . the main police investigator in the case said the altar boy had given details of the abuse after initial hesitation . " you could see that he was simply very ashamed of what had happened , " she said .
the lawyer for the victim 's family said the boy hardly left home and had problems sleeping . not the first time it 's not the first time the clergyman is in the dock for sexual abuse . he was sentenced to parole in 2000 for molesting a child . the priest , however , violated his parole conditions , according to the charges against him .
in 2001 , he is said to have taken up work again as a pastor in the community and to have supervised youth groups although he was forbidden form working with young people . the charges say the priest invited children and youths to his cellar where they were allowed to smoke a water pipe and drink alcohol .
he stands accused of making improper sexual advances to young altar boys during several excursions and at his home . diocese failed to stop tainted priest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller is under fire the case has stirred anger in the region with many outraged at the perceived failure of the authorities to prevent the priest from taking up work in the parish and seeking contact with altar boys .
around a dozen people demonstrated outside the courthouse on thursday , protesting against regensburg 's bishop gerhard ludwig mueller for reinstating the priest despite his prior conviction . the court on thursday found that the diocese of regensburg had failed to adequately inform the public about the sex abuse scandal surrounding the cleric . the diocese had initially said the priest was back at work only in 2004 after he completed therapy .
but files seized by the police showed that the diocese leadership was well-informed about the clergyman 's work in the parish .
after the death of his predecessor , the accused was the responsible priest in the parish during his parole . regensburg 's state attorney said there was a strong risk of the priest repeating the sexual offences if he did not undergo therapy . recurring problem long a taboo topic , cases of pedophilia among priests have come to light in a variety of countries in recent years .
catholic dioceses in the untied states have paid out more than a billion dollars in compensation to abuse victims in the past four years .
the vatican has not become involved in the riekofen affair . the diocese of regensburg has been shaken by a number of sex abuse cases in past years . in 2002 , the conference of bishops in germany issued guidelines on pedophilia . the needs of the victims were to have priority over the needs of the accused priest . those rules say former pedophiles must not be employed in posts where they may have contact with children . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by 31-year-old patrick s. from leipzig , who has four children aged between six years and 34 months with his sister , susan , who is eight years younger .
all the children but one are now in foster care .
two were born handicapped , although it is unclear whether this is a result of having been born prematurely or inbreeding .
in 2004 , patrick s. voluntarily underwent a vasectomy .
a right to sexual relations among siblings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does everyone have a right to choose their partner ?
the couple were calling for a declaration that brothers and sisters have a right to sexual relations with one another .
patrick s. has already spent over two years behind bars and now faces a 30-month sentence .
susan has also received a conviction of incest and was placed on probation for one year .
under german law , incest is only punishable after the age of 18 .
" historical relic " the couple have been backed by a number of politicians on the grounds that incest might be immoral but should not be punished by law because a ban contravenes an adult 's right to sexual freedom .
their supporters argue that the law is out of date and say it harks back to the racial hygiene laws of nazi germany .
their critics , meanwhile , insist that incest should remain a social taboo because of the risks linked to inbreeding and the resulting imbalance in social and family relations .
endrik wilhelm , the couple 's lawyer , argued that the couple have caused no harm to others .
the law was a " historical relic , " he said .
" everyone should be able to do what he wants as long as it does n't harm others , " he has said , stressing that incest is not illegal in many of germany 's neighboring countries , he said .
growing up apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historically , incest is a moral taboo although they shared the same parents , the couple did not grow up together .
patrock s. was adopted as a baby and only met his sister in 2000 when he tracked down his birth mother .
according to german media reports , the couple became close after their widowed mother died at the age of 50 .
the relationship began when susan was 16 .
according to experts , incest is rare among siblings who have lived together , and usually occurs between brothers and sisters raised apart .
the phenomenon is known as genetic sexual attraction , and affects as many as 50 percent of siblings or parents and offspring who were separated at birth and reunited as adults .
the case has attracted vast media coverage in germany , with the couple fielding ongoing requests for interviews , book deals and film rights . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests .
the survey was released ahead of the german islam conference on thursday , march 13 , where the thorny topic of integration tops the agenda . over three quarters of the turks surveyed , both with and without german passports , said german chancellor angel merkel did n't adequately represent those in germany with a turkish background .
the report , based on 400 responses , was published in the wednesday edition of die zeit . ninety-two percent said they thought that " turks in germany should preserve their own culture , " and nearly as many -lrb- 89 percent -rrb- felt that german society should be more considerate about the customs of turkish immigrants . nevertheless , a sweeping majority -lrb- 83 percent -rrb- considered the german language a key to success as an immigrant and two-thirds did n't regret their decision to come to germany . " the opinions represented in the survey show that we have to do more to strengthen the feeling of belonging for those in germany with turkish backgrounds , " said germany 's integration commissioner maria boehmer .
" the 2.7 million people in germany from turkish families belong to us ; they 're an important part of our society . " round three for islam dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany are n't centrally represented interior minister wolfgang schaeuble on thursday is to meet with representatives from a variety of german muslim organizations as the third part of an ongoing series of islam conferences intended to span two to three years . the aim of the conference , which will cover topics like constitutional values , social order and the media , is to better integrate the estimated 3.4 million muslims living in germany . several of the organizations present are considered to be fundamentalist - including the milli gorus turkish-islam association -lrb- igmg -rrb- , the islamic society in germany -lrb- igd -rrb- and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- - and do not necessarily represent the majority of muslims in germany . minister suggests islam lessons in school ahead of the conference , schaeuble opened the door to establishing islam religion classes in german schools .
religion is part of the standard curriculum , with most students participating in courses on the catholic or protestant faiths . as a prerequisite , islam would have to be formally recognized by the government as a religious group , said the minister .
the courses would be conducted in german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble said muslim students have a right to islam lessons in school " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " erdogan asks merkel for joint rally also on thursday , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan expressed regret that german chancellor merkel did not attend the mass rally he held for turkish immigrants during his visit to cologne in february . " if we had stood on the stage together there , it would have been a message to the german society and a motivation to the turks living in germany , " said erdogan in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" we can make it up whenever ms. merkel likes . " erdogan had attracted criticism in germany when , during the rally , he warned turks in germany not to lose their culture .
merkel had responded by saying she did n't share the prime minister 's view of integration . " assimilation is tantamount to a crime against humanity , " erdogan had said in february . integration takes a few blows bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan irked some with his thoughts on integration it 's thought-provoking that thousands of people in germany feel better represented by erdogan than by german politicians , commented armin laschet , integration minister in the state of north rhine-westphalia . immigrants should know that they are not obliged to assimilate , he added .
instead , " the conference aims to compel everyone to adhere to the values of the constitution and the laws that have effect in germany . " a series of events in recent weeks have stoked tension over integration in germany .
in early february , nine turkish immigrants lost their lives when an apartment building in the south-western city of ludwigshafen caught fire .
the blaze was initially thought to be a case of arson , but authorities later said this suspicion was inaccurate . hesse 's incumbent state premier , roland koch , also ruffled feathers earlier this year with an anti-immigrant campaign ahead of parliamentary elections .
in particular , he advocated deporting non-german juvenile delinquents . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction .
-lrb- 01.03.2008 -rrb- low rate of german-turkish marriages impedes integration many german turks are pressured to marry only within their ethnic and religious group .
but the practice of " importing " partners from turkey creates new immigrants and stands in the way of integration .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .
" we can do that anytime mrs. merkel wants to . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 13.03.2008 iran heads for less than fair elections , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are n't many faces from the opposition among the candidates president mahmoud ahmadinejad has weakened iran 's economy , but the reformist parties ca n't benefit from his mistakes in the parliamentary elections , said iranian political scientist and journalist behrouz khosrozadeh . behrouz khosrozadeh is an iranian political scientist and journalist living in germany .
he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

he spoke to dw-world.de about the upcoming iranian election . dw-world.de : a large number of candidates , particularly from the reformist parties , have been rejected by the electoral commissions .
as a result , the reformists are n't likely to build up a strong faction in parliament .
can we even really talk about " elections " in this case ? behrouz khosrozadeh : the islamic republic is neither a genuine dictatorship nor a totalitarian regime .
however , elections in a theocracy in general , and in the eighth parliamentary session in particular , are n't free .
the election monitor , the council of guardians and the ministry of the interior have carried out the most extensive manipulation in the history of the islamic republic . the seventh parliamentary elections took place during mohammad khatami 's presidency -lsb- 1997-2005 -rsb- .
the elections are only free in that the opposition can be present in parliament via an inferior faction without any influence . despite their original statements to the contrary , some reformist parties close to former president khatami now want to participate .
how reasonable are their arguments and what do they stand to achieve ? the pragmatic-reformist camp surrounding -lsb- akbar hashemi -rsb- rafsanjani and khatami expected manipulation by the council of guardians and ahmadinejad 's interior ministry .
but no one was prepared for them to go as far as filtering out 90 percent of the opposition candidates .
the reformists actually had big hopes of winning back the legislature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad became president in 2005 ahmadinejad 's persistent national debt and the extremely weak seventh parliament , which is dominated by faithful conservative party members , did n't leave the conservatives with a chance to win the election if it were to be freely held .
the opposition should have known that the conservatives did n't have a choice other than using the legal - yet unfair - means at their disposal , which is what the conservatives did .
looking at it this way , the reformists have shown a tremendous amount of unprofessionalism , abstruseness and helplessness . still , the reformers want to be present in parliament because they do n't have many other official public forums .
they 're looking ahead to the next presidential election and do n't want to surrender the parliament completely to the conservatives . it 's seems to be a three-way race between supporters of ahmadinejad , the reformers and a new conservative faction , which has developed as an alternative to the two traditional camps .
how serious is the cleft between the conservatives and will the three-party situation have an impact on iran 's political landscape over the next few months and years ? this cleft began with ahmadinejad 's presidency .
but it wo n't keep the conservatives from bolstering ahmadinejad 's government from the criticisms of the opposition .
the religious leader khamenei also continues to stand behind the president .
but i think that the critical conservatives - which have separate lists of candidates with some overlap - are considering a somewhat more acceptable solution that features a smart , conservative figure who presents himself as future-oriented and less aggressive to both domestically and internationally . the conservatives know that they do n't have a future with ahmadinejad .
all the statistical and demographic indicators point to a still latent but explosive mood among the population .
this is a result of ahmadinejad 's economic policies .
in tehran , due to an oil price of over $ 100 per barrel , no one understands the growing poverty .
the prominent conservative ahmad tavakoli described ahmadinejad 's economic policies as a " ship without a compass . " the warnings of the islamic revolution guardians army 's chief ideologist hassan abbasi speak volumes : " the dissatisfaction of the population and social problems are much more dangerous than an attack by the us . " getting back to the question , i think the conservatives will change their course away from an aggressive conservatism to a smarter one within the context of the islamic republic , which could be represented by the current parliamentary president gholam ali haddad-adel .
it 's about the very survival of the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote is on friday , march 14 some have said that iran 's structure and constitution would n't allow for serious reforms .
do you share this opinion ? yes and no .
the political system in the islamic republic did have a reform-oriented president for two terms , even if he was continually hindered by the conservatives .
the reformists largely dominated the sixth parliament . today , the reformists are paying the price for their strategic mistake of running with four candidates in the relatively free 2005 presidential elections and taking votes away from each other .
the phenomenon of ahmadinejad as president never would have happened it the people of tehran had n't boycotted the 2003 local elections .
only 12 percent of eligible voters participated and elected ahmadinejad as governor , a position he later used as a springboard into the presidential palace . it was a similar situation in the 2004 parliamentary elections .
the iranians had forgotten that politics is like soccer .
you have to stay on the field at least until overtime or the penalty shootout . the starting position has changed drastically since 2004 and even more since 2005 -lsb- with ahmadinejad 's election as president -rsb- .
one has to look at what kind of political institutions both camps have available to them .
the major reform parties are n't even allowed to have an official publication .
the conservatives have control of both the legislative and executive branches of government . ayatollah seyed mahmoud hashemi shahrudi , a moderate spiritual leader , is at the head of the judiciary , but the conservative tehran judge saeed mortazavi effectively has the power .
shahroudi 's instructions are sometimes ignored by the provincial judges .
the conservatives have the islamic revolution guardians army on their side . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politics is like soccer , said khosrozadeh i have to say that new developments and trends can be observed among the population as pressure on the opposition increases .
successive cases of repression will ultimately confront the islamic republic with existential challenges . ali akbar musavi khomeini , former chairmen of the alumni branch of the only legal oppositional student group , which is also the country 's largest student organization , put it like this in 2003 when he was a parliamentarian in the sixth parliament : " our country 's main problem is that there are institutions that are outside of state control .
they act under the protection and supervision of one person and this person does n't allow any changes or reforms and is above the law . " that authority is the religious leader and the system of absolute power for jurists .

" in the not too far future , we - where there 's wish and need for it - will have islam religion classes at german schools , " german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , who initiated the conference , told journalists . schaeuble said the conference had been " very drawn-out and painful " and added that the meetings would continue beyond 2009 . plans hobbled by lack of teachers ahead of the conference , schaeuble said religion classes on islam would help deter parents from sending their children to informal religious lessons taught by instructors who had not been vetted by the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped teaching islam in schools will do away with the need for informal lessons " we 're going up against hate preachers any way we can , " schaeuble said thursday in an interview with stern online .
" with islam religion classes , we 'd create competition . " the aim is to offer islam as a regular subject in schools taught in german by teachers trained in germany .
so far , the content of religion lessons in germans schools is coordinated between schools and officials from christian and jewish faiths . however , an acute lack of teachers qualified to teach the subject may mean it could take years before the project can be implemented . bekir alboga , head of a german muslim council , said children should be taught about islam throughout the country and criticized the dearth of teachers . " this is a failure in germany - a failure of the state , " alboga told regional daily ruhr nachrichten . feeling like unwanted guests the islam conference , which brings together representatives of the country 's muslim community and senior german lawmakers , has been dogged by criticism in the past for being little more than a debating forum that lacks clear goals . the conference is designed to smooth tensions with the country 's estimated 3.4 million muslims and promote their integration into german society .
the majority of germany 's muslims are turks , who were either born or have lived in german for decades yet do not feel particularly welcome .
a survey published ahead of the conference suggested that over half of turks living in germany feel like unwanted guests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fire sparked tensions between germans and turks in an interview with a german newspaper ahead of the conference , turkey 's prime tayyip erdogan stoked the debate further by urging berlin to take measures to counter discrimination against its large turkish population and criticizing chancellor angela merkel for not joining him for an event in cologne last month attended by thousands of turks . " the german government must take severe measures , " erdogan told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" i have relatives in germany and they tell me : ' we are scared . " ' the turkish leader was responding to a question about a fire at a building last month that killed nine people of turkish origin in the german city of ludwigshafen .
erdogan was accompanied by merkel during a visit to the site . though the turkish media has speculated that the fire was a racially-motivated attack after nazi symbols were reported to be painted on the building , german investigators have ruled out arson as the cause of the blaze . german or turkish ? during a trip to germany to meet with survivors and relatives of the victims of the fire , erdogan also addressed a crowd of 16,000 people of mainly turkish origin in cologne .
he sparked a storm of protest in germany by calling assimilation " a crime against humanity " in his speech and urging the crowd to safeguard their culture .
merkel reacted furiously , saying that the millions of people in the country of turkish origin owed their primary allegiance to the german state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was angered by erdogan 's comments erdogan reiterated the remarks in the interview , saying immigrants should not face pressure to sacrifice their cultural roots while accepting the language and customs of their adopted home . in an interview with german newspaper suedeutsche zeitung , schaeuble acknowledged that more needed to be done to make muslims feel at home in germany .
but he criticized erdogan for telling turks to resist becoming part of german society . " i 'm not insisting that all turks become germans - but when they want to become german citizens they can not remain turkish , " schaeuble said . erdogan also said merkel had missed an opportunity by not attending the cologne event with him . " if we had stood together on the stage it would have sent a message to german society and inspired turks living in germany , " he said .

now , nearly 400 years later , the city once again plays host to the leipzig book fair , held this year from march 13-16 , 2008 . " before the second world war , leipzig was known as the headquarters of the german book trade , " said sabine knopf , author of the book , " der leipziger gutenbergweg " -lrb- " leipzig 's gutenberg path " -rrb- , which traces the city 's literary history . with its very own " graphics quarter " neighborhood , knopf explained , the city served as a model for english publishers and booksellers in the 1920s , providing an organizational pattern that 's spread throughout the world .
by 1930 , the city with 230,000 residents had 436 publishers , 277 printers , and 69 bookstores .
one in 10 residents worked in the book industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city hall remains a symbol of leipzig 's grand past all that changed once the third reich rose to power .
many jewish-owned publishing houses were closed .
the graphics quarter was destroyed during world war ii bombing raids , burning along with it more than a million books .
the city that had influenced publishing around the world no longer had a book trade of its own . struggling to re-establish itself after the war ended , leipzig struggled to return to its publishing heritage . " many publishing houses did n't receive licenses after 1945 , " said knopf .
" publishers either moved away , closed , or were ousted . " still , not all was lost .
the renowned german creative writing program " deutsches literaturinstitut " - known in the former east germany as the johannes r. becher institut - was founded in leipzig in 1955 .
the city 's publishing industry likewise slowly began to re-emerge under communist rule . though german reunification saw many publishing houses close , leipzig has since worked diligently to regain some of its former glory and to establish itself as a home for new literature .
training programs for booksellers were formed and small publishers began to develop in the city .
young authors moved there as students of the deutsches literaturinstitut . the leipzig book fair , reorganized in 1991 after a decades-long hiatus , also contributed to the renaissance .
while focusing primarily on making german and central and eastern european literature accessible to the public , the book fair also seeks to highlight the city 's literary traditions while giving back to the community . leipzig reads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the leipzig book fair appeals to old and young alike one of the ways the book fair gives back is by concurrently running the literary festival " leipzig reads . "
alongside the more than 2,300 exhibitions from 36 countries set up at the fairgrounds , the separate festival features 1,900 author readings in 300 locations throughout the city .
from traditional spots like cafes and bookstores to more unusual locales , including a crematorium , " leipzig reads " showcases local offerings while connecting writers with their reading public . " leipzig has restored its literary character while dealing with difficult economic conditions , " said oliver zille , head of the leipzig book fair .
" without a doubt , these four days of the annual festival can help the city and the entire publishing sector .

the british beer and pub association said beer prices were already rising sharply because of the soaring cost of hops and barley .
the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- said the tax rise will do nothing to stop binge-drinking by teenagers .
it warned the move will deprive the treasury of extra tax by encouraging booze cruises and alcohol smuggling .
drinkers ' punished ' the bbc 's business correspondent , nils blythe , says that widespread concern about binge-drinking may have been behind the budget 's 6 % increase in alcohol duty . "
it 's a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub " mike benner camra chief executive that is expected to push up the cost of an average pint from £ 2.50 to £ 2.70 by the end of the year .
but , in addition to wednesday 's rise , chancellor alistair darling announced that alcohol duty would increase by 2 % above inflation each year for the next four years .
the british beer and pub association -lrb- bbpa -rrb- accused the government of punishing all beer drinkers rather than tackling the minority of drunken hooligans .
bbpa chief executive rob hayward said : " every single day , the treasury is losing over £ 1m in beer taxes and four pubs are closing .
" people are now drinking one million fewer pints a day compared with last year .
that trend will continue , " he said .
" it 's a decision doomed to failure - bad for taxpayers , beer , pubs and bad for the treasury as well . "
the campaign for real ale said : " this budget will do nothing to stop binge drinking , but it will lead to pub closures on a huge scale , widen the gap between supermarket and pub prices and encourage smuggling and cross-border shopping . "
camra chief executive mike benner called it " a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub " .
even without the higher duty , the bbpa had forecast that beer prices would have risen by 7 % this year due to the higher cost of raw materials .
drink ' affordable ' by contrast , medical experts welcomed the higher alcohol duty .
professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians and chairman of the uk alcohol health alliance , said the evidence suggested even moderately higher taxation would reduce alcohol-related deaths .
" alcohol is now 65 % more affordable than it was in 1980 , and we need to reverse this trend , " he said .
" the impact of an increase in duty on alcohol will be effective only if combined with strong government action to prevent irresponsible discounting and promotions by the retail industry . "

the british beer and pub association said beer prices were already rising sharply because of the soaring cost of hops and barley .
the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- said the tax rise will do nothing to stop binge-drinking by teenagers .
it warned the move will deprive the treasury of extra tax by encouraging booze cruises and alcohol smuggling .
drinkers ' punished ' the bbc 's business correspondent , nils blythe , says that widespread concern about binge-drinking may have been behind the budget 's 6 % increase in alcohol duty .
it 's a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub mike benner camra chief executive that is expected to push up the cost of an average pint from £ 2.50 to £ 2.70 by the end of the year .
but , in addition to wednesday 's rise , chancellor alistair darling announced that alcohol duty would increase by 2 % above inflation each year for the next four years .
the british beer and pub association -lrb- bbpa -rrb- accused the government of punishing all beer drinkers rather than tackling the minority of drunken hooligans .
bbpa chief executive rob hayward said : " every single day , the treasury is losing over £ 1m in beer taxes and four pubs are closing .
" people are now drinking one million fewer pints a day compared with last year .
that trend will continue , " he said .
the beer lobby says higher prices spell doom for british pubs " it 's a decision doomed to failure - bad for taxpayers , beer , pubs and bad for the treasury as well . "
the campaign for real ale said : " this budget will do nothing to stop binge drinking , but it will lead to pub closures on a huge scale , widen the gap between supermarket and pub prices and encourage smuggling and cross-border shopping . "
camra chief executive mike benner called it " a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub " .
even without the higher duty , the bbpa had forecast that beer prices would have risen by 7 % this year due to the higher cost of raw materials .
drink ' affordable ' by contrast , medical experts welcomed the higher alcohol duty .
professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians and chairman of the uk alcohol health alliance , said the evidence suggested even moderately higher taxation would reduce alcohol-related deaths .
" alcohol is now 65 % more affordable than it was in 1980 , and we need to reverse this trend , " he said .
" the impact of an increase in duty on alcohol will be effective only if combined with strong government action to prevent irresponsible discounting and promotions by the retail industry . "

the british beer and pub association said beer prices were already rising sharply because of the soaring cost of hops and barley .
the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- said the tax rise will do nothing to stop binge-drinking by teenagers .
it warned the move will deprive the treasury of extra tax by encouraging booze cruises and alcohol smuggling .
drinkers ' punished ' the bbc 's business correspondent , nils blythe , says that widespread concern about binge-drinking may have been behind the budget 's 6 % increase in alcohol duty .
it 's a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub mike benner camra chief executive that is expected to push up the cost of an average pint from £ 2.50 to £ 2.70 by the end of the year .
but , in addition to wednesday 's rise , chancellor alistair darling announced that alcohol duty would increase by 2 % above inflation each year for the next four years .
the british beer and pub association -lrb- bbpa -rrb- accused the government of punishing all beer drinkers rather than tackling the minority of drunken hooligans .
bbpa chief executive rob hayward said : " every single day , the treasury is losing over £ 1m in beer taxes and four pubs are closing .
" people are now drinking one million fewer pints a day compared with last year .
that trend will continue , " he said .
the beer lobby says higher prices spell doom for british pubs " it 's a decision doomed to failure - bad for taxpayers , beer , pubs and bad for the treasury as well . "
the campaign for real ale said : " this budget will do nothing to stop binge drinking , but it will lead to pub closures on a huge scale , widen the gap between supermarket and pub prices and encourage smuggling and cross-border shopping . "
camra chief executive mike benner called it " a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub " .
even without the higher duty , the bbpa had forecast that beer prices would have risen by 7 % this year due to the higher cost of raw materials .
drink ' affordable ' by contrast , medical experts welcomed the higher alcohol duty .
professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians and chairman of the uk alcohol health alliance , said the evidence suggested even moderately higher taxation would reduce alcohol-related deaths .
" alcohol is now 65 % more affordable than it was in 1980 , and we need to reverse this trend , " he said .
" the impact of an increase in duty on alcohol will be effective only if combined with strong government action to prevent irresponsible discounting and promotions by the retail industry . "

the british beer and pub association said beer prices were already rising sharply because of the soaring cost of hops and barley .
the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- said the tax rise will do nothing to stop binge-drinking by teenagers .
it warned the move will deprive the treasury of extra tax by encouraging booze cruises and alcohol smuggling .
drinkers ' punished ' the bbc 's business correspondent , nils blythe , says that widespread concern about binge-drinking may have been behind the budget 's 6 % increase in alcohol duty .
it 's a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub mike benner camra chief executive that is expected to push up the cost of an average pint from £ 2.50 to £ 2.70 by the end of the year .
but , in addition to wednesday 's rise , chancellor alistair darling announced that alcohol duty would increase by 2 % above inflation each year for the next four years .
the british beer and pub association -lrb- bbpa -rrb- accused the government of punishing all beer drinkers rather than tackling the minority of drunken hooligans .
bbpa chief executive rob hayward said : " every single day , the treasury is losing over £ 1m in beer taxes and four pubs are closing .
" people are now drinking one million fewer pints a day compared with last year .
that trend will continue , " he said .
the beer lobby says higher prices spell doom for british pubs " it 's a decision doomed to failure - bad for taxpayers , beer , pubs and bad for the treasury as well . "
the campaign for real ale said : " this budget will do nothing to stop binge drinking , but it will lead to pub closures on a huge scale , widen the gap between supermarket and pub prices and encourage smuggling and cross-border shopping . "
camra chief executive mike benner called it " a great big nail whacked ruthlessly into the coffin of the british pub " .
even without the higher duty , the bbpa had forecast that beer prices would have risen by 7 % this year due to the higher cost of raw materials .
drink ' affordable ' by contrast , medical experts welcomed the higher alcohol duty .
professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians and chairman of the uk alcohol health alliance , said the evidence suggested even moderately higher taxation would reduce alcohol-related deaths .
" alcohol is now 65 % more affordable than it was in 1980 , and we need to reverse this trend , " he said .
" the impact of an increase in duty on alcohol will be effective only if combined with strong government action to prevent irresponsible discounting and promotions by the retail industry . "

a report by the public accounts committee at stormont said the amount owed in northern ireland is £ 71m .
but only 12 people were successfully prosecuted for non-payment of child support during the first nine months of this financial year .
pac chairman john o 'dowd said children were being let down .
" we have urged that the csa does go out after the money , that they set higher targets - £ 1.5m of debt collection next year is not acceptable , " he said .
there are thousands of people avoiding paying maintenance on the csa 's books , but a third of absent parents paid nothing .
the agency is working with the judiciary but is handling 9,500 cases where the non-resident parent failed to make full and regular payment , affecting around 12,600 children .
the pac said it was dismayed that the agency considered 58 % of its £ 71m debt to be uncollectable and warned it had set recovery targets which were not ambitious enough .
" it is the committee 's view that this is sending out the message that if someone is assessed by the agency for child maintenance they do not have to pay because it is unlikely that the agency will collect it , " it said .
administrative costs are eating up 88p out of every pound collected in ni , compared to 57p in the great britain equivalent .
the department for social development -lrb- dsd -rrb- told the committee there were more parents on benefits in northern ireland and wage levels were 85 % of those in great britain , decreasing the sums collected .
inadequate and poorly performing it systems have also been blamed for many of the problems , including 15-year-old debt .

a report by the public accounts committee at stormont said the amount owed in northern ireland is £ 71m .
but only 12 people were successfully prosecuted for non-payment of child support during the first nine months of this financial year .
pac chairman john o 'dowd said children were being let down .
" we have urged that the csa does go out after the money , that they set higher targets - £ 1.5m of debt collection next year is not acceptable , " he said .
there are thousands of people avoiding paying maintenance on the csa 's books , but a third of absent parents paid nothing .
the agency is working with the judiciary but is handling 9,500 cases where the non-resident parent failed to make full and regular payment , affecting around 12,600 children .
the pac said it was dismayed that the agency considered 58 % of its £ 71m debt to be uncollectable and warned it had set recovery targets which were not ambitious enough .
" it is the committee 's view that this is sending out the message that if someone is assessed by the agency for child maintenance they do not have to pay because it is unlikely that the agency will collect it , " it said .
administrative costs are eating up 88p out of every pound collected in ni , compared to 57p in the great britain equivalent .
the department for social development -lrb- dsd -rrb- told the committee there were more parents on benefits in northern ireland and wage levels were 85 % of those in great britain , decreasing the sums collected .
inadequate and poorly performing it systems have also been blamed for many of the problems , including 15-year-old debt .

its report shows not all of the £ 4.5m spent on the election , £ 2 for each elector , was properly accounted for .
and it found " only limited evidence " fees for election staff were for duties not covered by their council salaries .
the assembly government has agreed that changes are needed but they will not be made until after may 's local elections .
the document was produced by the electoral commission with help from the wales audit office , following concerns raised previously about the running of elections .
in 2006 two staff members in bridgend were dismissed after a council inquiry found £ 50,000 was improperly claimed in expenses and " numerous examples " of poor practice in the running of elections .
reviewing the 2007 assembly election , the electoral commission report found that some returning officers had " claimed the maximum amounts for clerical assistance and training without providing documentary evidence that the costs had been properly incurred " .
returning officers are formally in charge of local electoral arrangements and are usually also the chief executive of the area 's local authority . "
we must ensure that roles and responsibilities are clear , understandable and fit for the 21st century " dr brian gibbons , local government minister the report observes that most returning officers received the entire fee for their services , despite " informally nominating deputies " , while others split the sum with " properly appointed deputies " .
a wide variation in the cost of running elections in different parts of wales , particularly when comparing the five electoral regions , is also noted .
the regional costs ranged from just over £ 12,500 to more than £ 150,000 .
the different demands of running elections in rural and urban areas may at least partly explain this .
the head of the electoral commission 's office in wales , kay jenkins , stressed that " for the most part , controls exercised by returning officers are effective " .
" local authority staff work very hard , of course , to deliver effective elections , " she said .
" we 'd be keen to ensure that the legal framework for supporting elections is strengthened , because there were significant variations in costs claimed by local authorities across wales , " ms jenkins added .
in a statement , local government minister dr brian gibbons said some aspects of electoral finance were " due for a thorough review " .
" i am eager to work with our partners to ensure that the administrative funding system is fit for purpose , providing sufficient and appropriate rewards to those who participate , " he said .
' respect and confidence ' however dr gibbons said his first priority was ensuring that local elections were run " in an open and democratic way " and promised to then respond in more detail to the findings .
" for the system to command the respect and confidence of the citizen we must ensure that roles and responsibilities are clear , understandable and fit for the 21st century .
" i intend to work closely with the elections planning group , the electoral commission and engage fully with the uk government on this matter , " dr gibbons added .

we must ensure that roles and responsibilities are clear , understandable and fit for the 21st century dr brian gibbons , local government minister the report observes that most returning officers received the entire fee for their services , despite " informally nominating deputies " , while others split the sum with " properly appointed deputies " .
a wide variation in the cost of running elections in different parts of wales , particularly when comparing the five electoral regions , is also noted .
the regional costs ranged from just over £ 12,500 to more than £ 150,000 .
the different demands of running elections in rural and urban areas may at least partly explain this .
the head of the electoral commission 's office in wales , kay jenkins , stressed that " for the most part , controls exercised by returning officers are effective " .
" local authority staff work very hard , of course , to deliver effective elections , " she said .
" we 'd be keen to ensure that the legal framework for supporting elections is strengthened , because there were significant variations in costs claimed by local authorities across wales , " ms jenkins added .
in a statement , local government minister dr brian gibbons said some aspects of electoral finance were " due for a thorough review " .
" i am eager to work with our partners to ensure that the administrative funding system is fit for purpose , providing sufficient and appropriate rewards to those who participate , " he said .
' respect and confidence ' however dr gibbons said his first priority was ensuring that local elections were run " in an open and democratic way " and promised to then respond in more detail to the findings .
" for the system to command the respect and confidence of the citizen we must ensure that roles and responsibilities are clear , understandable and fit for the 21st century .
" i intend to work closely with the elections planning group , the electoral commission and engage fully with the uk government on this matter , " dr gibbons added .

members of the haigside allotments in treherbert , rhondda , were initially told the site would close on friday .
after a barrage of protests , allotment holders say they have now won a short reprieve on animal welfare grounds .
however , they fear they will struggle to find homes for up to 600 pigeons and other animals kept on the site .
" it is a massive problem , " admitted the treasurer of the haigside allotment society , john evans .
" the pigeons here are homing pigeons .
if they are moved and then released they 'll try to return to their home lofts at the allotments , only there will be no-one there for them .
riding school mr evans said there were also scores of chickens and geese kept on the allotments .
" at the moment there is nowhere for the livestock to go , " he added .
he said he feared some of the pigeons may have to be destroyed .
the society , which includes the holders of allotments and small holdings and the riding school , is opposed to the four-acre -lrb- 1.6 hectare -rrb- site being considered for inclusion in the next local development plan .
they have drawn up a petition signed by 3,600 people calling on rhondda cynon taf council to protect the land , at the foot of the rhigos mountain , for community use .
rhondda mp , chris bryant , has called on the council to declare the land unsuitable for housing and keep it for allotment use .
mr bryant said : " i 'm not sure the law will allow a change in use if there 's not enough allotment land in the rhondda . "

members of the haigside allotments in treherbert , rhondda , were initially told the site would close on friday .
after a barrage of protests , allotment holders say they have now won a short reprieve on animal welfare grounds .
however , they fear they will struggle to find homes for up to 600 pigeons and other animals kept on the site .
" it is a massive problem , " admitted the treasurer of the haigside allotment society , john evans .
" the pigeons here are homing pigeons .
if they are moved and then released they 'll try to return to their home lofts at the allotments , only there will be no-one there for them .
riding school mr evans said there were also scores of chickens and geese kept on the allotments .
" at the moment there is nowhere for the livestock to go , " he added .
he said he feared some of the pigeons may have to be destroyed .
the society , which includes the holders of allotments and small holdings and the riding school , is opposed to the four-acre -lrb- 1.6 hectare -rrb- site being considered for inclusion in the next local development plan .
they have drawn up a petition signed by 3,600 people calling on rhondda cynon taf council to protect the land , at the foot of the rhigos mountain , for community use .
the allotments are at the foot of the rhigos mountain rhondda mp , chris bryant , has called on the council to declare the land unsuitable for housing and keep it for allotment use .
mr bryant said : " i 'm not sure the law will allow a change in use if there 's not enough allotment land in the rhondda . "
bbc wales contacted the office of the solicitor acting for landowner steven evans , but the solicitor was not available for comment .
those renting land at haigside allotments in treherbert , rhondda , include pensioners and a riding school for disabled children .

kelso - with a population of a little more than 6,000 - has been targeted by both sainsbury 's and tesco .
however , the two companies have selected different sites as their preferred development option .
it means they must await a verdict on scottish borders council 's local plan - due next week - on which location it wants to see progress .
in one corner is tesco 's proposal for a development at the town 's spylaw .
it wants to build a 46,500 sq ft store there alongside land which could be used for a business park .
the spylaw site is controlled by edinburgh firm miller developments .
at the moment what you have got , essentially , are two developers vying for two sites cllr alasdair hutton spokesman bruce lindsay said he believed it could attract more than a dozen companies at spylaw creating a large number of well-paid jobs .
he said he believed the scheme could do for the town what a similar project - cavalry park - had done for peebles .
in the opposite corner stands sainsbury 's pinnaclehill project .
it claims its plans for a 30,000 sq ft supermarket would bring about 200 full and part-time jobs to the town .
sainsbury 's development surveyor paul miller said the plans had been prepared after lengthy consultation with the people of the community .
he said it would " improve the choice of food shopping for local residents " but also " support the local economy " .
both firms say they want to work with local traders to the benefit of the town .
a decision on a supermarket site in kelso is due this month it is the latest chapter in a supermarket saga which kelso councillor alasdair hutton said goes back at least 10 years .
" as i understand it , public opinion wants to see something bigger and better than we have now , " he said .
" at the moment what you have got , essentially , are two developers vying for two sites .
" one of the sites will be favoured and the other will not - i doubt very much they will say there will be two . "
the date for that decision comes on 20 march .
mr hutton said he believed no matter which site was chosen it might bring other supermarket firms into the open .
" my feeling is that the developers for the two supermarkets may not be the only people who enter the race , " he said .
he said other firms might be " keeping their powder dry " .
however , mr hutton added that whoever won the day it might prove a boost for the town .
' quite buoyant ' he said it could stop locals travelling to galashiels , hawick or berwick for their shopping and attract other people in .
combined with a planned £ 1.5m refurbishment of the town centre , he said he believed the future was bright .
" kelso is quite buoyant - the shops do n't seem to stay empty for very long , " he said .
he said that existing stores might even benefit from a larger store opening .
" i think that they should look at it as an opportunity to make money from the people coming to the supermarket , " he said .

kelso - with a population of a little more than 6,000 - has been targeted by both sainsbury 's and tesco .
however , the two companies have selected different sites as their preferred development option .
it means they must await a verdict on scottish borders council 's local plan - due next week - on which location it wants to see progress .
in one corner is tesco 's proposal for a development at the town 's spylaw .
it wants to build a 46,500 sq ft store there alongside land which could be used for a business park .
the spylaw site is controlled by edinburgh firm miller developments .
at the moment what you have got , essentially , are two developers vying for two sites cllr alasdair hutton spokesman bruce lindsay said he believed it could attract more than a dozen companies at spylaw creating a large number of well-paid jobs .
he said he believed the scheme could do for the town what a similar project - cavalry park - had done for peebles .
in the opposite corner stands sainsbury 's pinnaclehill project .
it claims its plans for a 30,000 sq ft supermarket would bring about 200 full and part-time jobs to the town .
sainsbury 's development surveyor paul miller said the plans had been prepared after lengthy consultation with the people of the community .
he said it would " improve the choice of food shopping for local residents " but also " support the local economy " .
both firms say they want to work with local traders to the benefit of the town .
a decision on a supermarket site in kelso is due this month it is the latest chapter in a supermarket saga which kelso councillor alasdair hutton said goes back at least 10 years .
" as i understand it , public opinion wants to see something bigger and better than we have now , " he said .
" at the moment what you have got , essentially , are two developers vying for two sites .
" one of the sites will be favoured and the other will not - i doubt very much they will say there will be two . "
the date for that decision comes on 20 march .
mr hutton said he believed no matter which site was chosen it might bring other supermarket firms into the open .
" my feeling is that the developers for the two supermarkets may not be the only people who enter the race , " he said .
he said other firms might be " keeping their powder dry " .
however , mr hutton added that whoever won the day it might prove a boost for the town .
' quite buoyant ' he said it could stop locals travelling to galashiels , hawick or berwick for their shopping and attract other people in .
combined with a planned £ 1.5m refurbishment of the town centre , he said he believed the future was bright .
" kelso is quite buoyant - the shops do n't seem to stay empty for very long , " he said .
he said that existing stores might even benefit from a larger store opening .
" i think that they should look at it as an opportunity to make money from the people coming to the supermarket , " he said .

the grocer reported pre-tax profits for 2007 of £ 612m , up from £ 369m in 2006 , as long-standing chairman sir ken morrison retired from his post .
like-for-like sales at the bradford based grocer , excluding fuel sales , rose 4.6 % , down from the 5.2 % in 2007 .
the results suggest the chain , the uk 's fourth-largest , has revived its fortunes after buying safeway in 2004 .
" in my last statement as chairman of morrisons , it gives me particular pleasure to be reporting record earnings and to see that more customers than ever before are experiencing the freshness , quality and value that morrisons has to offer , " said the outgoing chairman .
sir ken will be replaced by deputy chairman ian gibson , who will succeed him as non-executive chairman .
it will be the first time a non-family member has headed the firm since it was founded in 1899 .
turnaround the turnaround comes amid a massive revamp across the business , to be completed by 2010 .
it includes a new look for stores , a new logo , new slogan , new product lines and new staff uniforms .
this has been supported by an extensive advertising campaign featuring football pundit alan hanson and singer lulu , which has succeeded in boosting the grocer 's customer numbers by half a million a week .
eight new stores have also been opened in the past year .
despite significant investment in the business , morrisons said it had reduced its net debt from £ 772m to £ 543m and pledged to return £ 1bn to shareholders during 2008 and 2009 through a share buyback .
bucking the trend ?
the high street is suffering badly from a combination of higher mortgage repayment and credit card costs , fuel and food bills , which are putting huge strain on british households .
but morrisons was confident that such an environment was positive for its business model .
" this environment presents an opportunity for morrisons , " said chief executive marc bolland .
" whilst many of our programmes are designed to improve product quality or the overall shopping experience , the great value we offer our customers will be at the forefront of our activity in the year ahead . "

the uk 's largest broadband supplier has called for the industry to be clearer about how it advertises net speeds .
bt wholesale , which supplies eight million people , said many customers were disappointed by the mismatch between advertised and actual speeds .
an independent survey found that 15 % of people who bought eight megabit per second packages actually got the speed .
the firm said regulators needed to agree rules about how broadband speeds could be sold to the public .
" the reality is we are all trying to push the technology , " guy bradshaw of bt wholesale told bbc news .
" the industry needs to join together with ofcom to agree a set of principles as to how these messages should be communicated and advertised so that the understanding with the consumer is as accurate as it can be . "
traffic problems bt said that , while its dsl max product offers a range of speeds up to eight megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- , it tells its customers - the internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- - that actual speeds will vary from user to user .
cameron rejali , managing director of products at bt wholesale , said it is up to the isps how they market broadband , " but if they are marketing it badly , the market will punish them . "
bt said users need to know that there is a difference between the line speed - what the line between their home and the exchange can support - and what it describes as " throughput " , a measure of the data coming down the line during an activity such as the downloading of a video .
only 35 % of bt 's dsl max customers are achieving an eight mbps line speed - the rest will see their speed cut by factors such as distance from the exchange , poor equipment , and interference from electrical appliances .
but none of these five million users will achieve eight mbps " throughput " because of internet congestion and other network issues .
" the reality is if you are very far from an exchange or there are environmental factors then your speed will come down and there is not much we can do in the short-term to address that problem , " said mr bradshaw .
ofcom is currently reviewing the way broadband is marketed to consumers .
a spokeswoman said : " whilst there are technical reasons why a consumer may not get the full speed of the package to which they have signed up the key point is that consumers should be able to make an informed decision about what broadband package is best for them at the point of purchase . "

only 35 % of bt 's dsl max customers are achieving an eight mbps line speed - the rest will see their speed cut by factors such as distance from the exchange , poor equipment , and interference from electrical appliances .
but none of these five million users will achieve eight mbps " throughput " because of internet congestion and other network issues .
" the reality is if you are very far from an exchange or there are environmental factors then your speed will come down and there is not much we can do in the short-term to address that problem , " said mr bradshaw .
ofcom is currently reviewing the way broadband is marketed to consumers .
a spokeswoman said : " whilst there are technical reasons why a consumer may not get the full speed of the package to which they have signed up the key point is that consumers should be able to make an informed decision about what broadband package is best for them at the point of purchase . "

the uk 's largest broadband supplier has called for the industry to be clearer about how it advertises net speeds .
bt wholesale , which supplies eight million people , said many customers were disappointed by the mismatch between advertised and actual speeds .
an independent survey found that 15 % of people who bought eight megabit per second packages actually got the speed .
the firm said regulators needed to agree rules about how broadband speeds could be sold to the public .
" the reality is we are all trying to push the technology , " guy bradshaw of bt wholesale told bbc news .
" the industry needs to join together with ofcom to agree a set of principles as to how these messages should be communicated and advertised so that the understanding with the consumer is as accurate as it can be . "
traffic problems bt said that , while its dsl max product offers a range of speeds up to eight megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- , it tells its customers - the internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- - that actual speeds will vary from user to user .
cameron rejali , managing director of products at bt wholesale , said it is up to the isps how they market broadband , " but if they are marketing it badly , the market will punish them . "
bt said users need to know that there is a difference between the line speed - what the line between their home and the exchange can support - and what it describes as " throughput " , a measure of the data coming down the line during an activity such as the downloading of a video .
only 35 % of bt 's dsl max customers are achieving an eight mbps line speed - the rest will see their speed cut by factors such as distance from the exchange , poor equipment , and interference from electrical appliances .

bbc news -pipe- school report -pipe- school report a perfect bbc fit bbc news / school report graphics version bbc sport home thursday , 13 march 2008 , 09:47 gmt school report a perfect bbc fit by huw edwards bbc news schools across the country are counting down to going on air as bbc news school report returns , bigger and better than ever before .
this year over 10,000 students , aged 11-14 , from more than 280 schools around the uk are taking part , broadcasting their stories and bulletins on bbc tv , radio and online .
one of the big challenges for any news presenter today is how to attract younger viewers .
for me , school report fits perfectly with what i think we , the bbc , should be doing .
feedback as the big day grew near , i visited charles edward brookes school in camberwell , south london , to find out how school reporters were preparing .
it 's been more than a quarter of a century since i was in the classroom as a french teacher , and it 's always a bit of a shock being back , but i love being in this kind of environment .
it 's always good to get first hand feedback from an audience of this age because they 'll tell you very directly what they like and what they do n't like .
i spent the morning with year 8 school reporters , gathering and discussing interesting news stories from newspapers and the internet . "
it 's always good to get first hand feedback from an audience of this age because they 'll tell you very directly what they like and what they do n't like " huw edwards i was pleased to see that each group of students had found a good mix of stories .
the trick in any news programme is to have a variety of stories which appeal to different bits of the audience , and give it wide appeal .
the stories might be great , but all that hard work will lose its impact if the language is n't crystal clear and direct .
it should n't leave any room for doubt at all .
different strengths we discussed how students divide up duties and choose the right people for the right roles , as different people have different strengths .
i asked which of them fancied having control over the content of the report , and explained the role of an editor , the person with real power , who makes all the big decisions but is never seen on screen .
we also considered who is best suited to be on camera presenting a news bulletin , as they 'll need to be someone who wants to communicate .
later on , the tables were turned and i found myself in the hot seat being grilled by two students who asked me how i keep a straight face in emotional situations , and what career advice i would give to young reporters .
school report is fun , it gives students the chance to do something that maybe they 've never done before , and the main message i wanted to leave the charles edward brookes students was - enjoy it !
the great thing about this year 's school report is that there 's a real sense of growth and energy .
when i mention it to teachers , it 's clear that there 's a great deal of recognition that school report is a very worthwhile project .
it gives people a real sense of what the bbc , and journalism , is about .
last year 120 schools took part and this year that figure has more than doubled , with over 300 schools and city learning centres involved .
hopefully by this time next year we 'll be even bigger .

this year over 10,000 students , aged 11-14 , from more than 280 schools around the uk are taking part , broadcasting their stories and bulletins on bbc tv , radio and online .
one of the big challenges for any news presenter today is how to attract younger viewers .
for me , school report fits perfectly with what i think we , the bbc , should be doing .
feedback as the big day grew near , i visited charles edward brookes school in camberwell , south london , to find out how school reporters were preparing .
it 's been more than a quarter of a century since i was in the classroom as a french teacher , and it 's always a bit of a shock being back , but i love being in this kind of environment .
it 's always good to get first hand feedback from an audience of this age because they 'll tell you very directly what they like and what they do n't like .
i spent the morning with year 8 school reporters , gathering and discussing interesting news stories from newspapers and the internet .
it 's always good to get first hand feedback from an audience of this age because they 'll tell you very directly what they like and what they do n't like huw edwards i was pleased to see that each group of students had found a good mix of stories .
the trick in any news programme is to have a variety of stories which appeal to different bits of the audience , and give it wide appeal .
the stories might be great , but all that hard work will lose its impact if the language is n't crystal clear and direct .
it should n't leave any room for doubt at all .
different strengths we discussed how students divide up duties and choose the right people for the right roles , as different people have different strengths .
i asked which of them fancied having control over the content of the report , and explained the role of an editor , the person with real power , who makes all the big decisions but is never seen on screen .
huw explains the various newsroom roles to be filled , including editor we also considered who is best suited to be on camera presenting a news bulletin , as they 'll need to be someone who wants to communicate .
later on , the tables were turned and i found myself in the hot seat being grilled by two students who asked me how i keep a straight face in emotional situations , and what career advice i would give to young reporters .
school report is fun , it gives students the chance to do something that maybe they 've never done before , and the main message i wanted to leave the charles edward brookes students was - enjoy it !
the great thing about this year 's school report is that there 's a real sense of growth and energy .
when i mention it to teachers , it 's clear that there 's a great deal of recognition that school report is a very worthwhile project .
it gives people a real sense of what the bbc , and journalism , is about .
last year 120 schools took part and this year that figure has more than doubled , with over 300 schools and city learning centres involved .
hopefully by this time next year we 'll be even bigger .

bt wholesale , which supplies eight million people , said many customers were disappointed by the mismatch between advertised and actual speeds .
an independent survey found that 15 % of people who bought eight megabit per second packages actually got the speed .
the firm said regulators needed to agree rules about how broadband speeds could be sold to the public .
" the reality is we are all trying to push the technology , " guy bradshaw of bt wholesale told bbc news .

only 35 % of bt 's dsl max customers are achieving an eight mbps line speed - the rest will see their speed cut by factors such as distance from the exchange , poor equipment , and interference from electrical appliances .

bt wholesale , which supplies eight million people , said many customers were disappointed by the mismatch between advertised and actual speeds .
an independent survey found that 15 % of people who bought eight megabit per second packages actually got the speed .
the firm said regulators needed to agree rules about how broadband speeds could be sold to the public .
" the reality is we are all trying to push the technology , " guy bradshaw of bt wholesale told bbc news .

train operators were running reduced services between scotland and york , and between leeds and london .

the union said the action was in protest at a scheme to cut the number of jobs at the north yorkshire site from 18 to 12 and comes after a vote in favour of industrial action .
general secretary bob crow said the action was because of " drastic cuts and safety issues " .
network rail said the walk out was " premature " and east coast mainline services would not be badly hit .

the track between york and doncaster has been blocked by fallen power lines brought down in this week 's high winds .
train operators were running reduced services between scotland and york , and between leeds and london .
services will be hit again as workers in york stage a five-day strike from next wednesday in a row over job cuts .
the dispute involves electrical workers at a network rail control room in york which supplies power to the whole east coast mainline .
the rail and maritime union -lrb- rmt -rrb- members will not work any shifts between wednesday evening and easter monday morning .
altered service however , network rail said some services would continue despite the action .
the union said the action was in protest at a scheme to cut the number of jobs at the north yorkshire site from 18 to 12 and comes after a vote in favour of industrial action .
general secretary bob crow said the action was because of " drastic cuts and safety issues " .
network rail said the walk out was " premature " and east coast mainline services would not be badly hit .
the damage to power lines on the route happened on wednesday afternoon , but persistently high winds made it too dangerous for engineers to begin repairs .
work was under way on thursday and was expected to be completed by about 1600 gmt .

bbc radio 4 's analysis : what are we fighting for ? will be broadcast on thursday , 13th march 2008 at 20:30 and repeated on sunday 9th march at 21.30 gmt read the programme transcript military cadets these days expect to be sent to war within months of completing their training .
those familiar soldiers ' questions - " what am i fighting for ? " and " is it worth my life ? " - will come very quickly to this generation of recruits .
and most are being asked to risk their lives , not in the direct defence , of their country , but thanks to the idea that the military are to be used as a force for good .
it 's an idea that is known by the shorthand of liberal interventionism .
yet what kind of future does it have , after the practical and ideological difficulties of intervention in both afghanistan and iraq ?
in this programme we discuss those questions with politicians and generals who have had to take the difficult decisions about war and peace , and with those who are doing the fighting - and sometimes the dying .
here are a selection of some of the key comments .
jonathan powell , chief of staff under tony blair " no-one in their right mind can be happy with what is happening on the streets of iraq at the moment .
people will retreat from this sort of interventionism in the future - that i think is absolutely the danger . "
simon jenkins , columnist " liberal interventionism as defined i have to say almost exclusively by tony blair - i mean there are not many texts which really go along with it - but we 're dealing with an almost crazy set of abstract nouns here .
insofar as it carries any bite , after iraq and afghanistan we are going to be very , very , very scared of going anywhere . "
general sir mike jackson , former head of the army " we are a major player , whether we want to be or not , we are a major player on the world stage and what britain does or does n't do is looked at very carefully by the international arena .
i do n't think some sort of fortress britain , pull up the notional drawbridge , hunker down and everything 'll be fine , in today 's globalised world , i just do n't see that as an available strategy for us . "
douglas hurd , former foreign secretary " the disaster of iraq has set back the general cause of humanitarian intervention which is why the foreign secretary david miliband now begins to set out the case again .
there is a case , there is a case philosophically for saying it is part of our job to help with others make the world a more decent place , but it does depend on getting your facts right , getting your sums right , making decent plans for the likely future . "
lord -lrb- paddy -rrb- ashdown , former high representative in kosovo " it is n't over when the fighting 's over , and i think the realisation of afghanistan and iraq is that you can win the war but then go on to lose the peace unless you do it properly and structuring your armed forces just to fight the war but also to sustain what kipling called the savage war of peace .

will the public be ready to send troops to fight for " good causes " ?
bbc radio 4 's analysis : what are we fighting for ? will be broadcast on thursday , 13th march 2008 at 20:30 and repeated on sunday 9th march at 21.30 gmt read the programme transcript military cadets these days expect to be sent to war within months of completing their training .
those familiar soldiers ' questions - " what am i fighting for ? " and " is it worth my life ? " - will come very quickly to this generation of recruits .
and most are being asked to risk their lives , not in the direct defence , of their country , but thanks to the idea that the military are to be used as a force for good .
it 's an idea that is known by the shorthand of liberal interventionism .
yet what kind of future does it have , after the practical and ideological difficulties of intervention in both afghanistan and iraq ?
in this programme we discuss those questions with politicians and generals who have had to take the difficult decisions about war and peace , and with those who are doing the fighting - and sometimes the dying .
here are a selection of some of the key comments .
jonathan powell , chief of staff under tony blair " no-one in their right mind can be happy with what is happening on the streets of iraq at the moment .
people will retreat from this sort of interventionism in the future - that i think is absolutely the danger . "
simon jenkins , columnist " liberal interventionism as defined i have to say almost exclusively by tony blair - i mean there are not many texts which really go along with it - but we 're dealing with an almost crazy set of abstract nouns here .
insofar as it carries any bite , after iraq and afghanistan we are going to be very , very , very scared of going anywhere . "
general sir mike jackson general sir mike jackson , former head of the army " we are a major player , whether we want to be or not , we are a major player on the world stage and what britain does or does n't do is looked at very carefully by the international arena .
i do n't think some sort of fortress britain , pull up the notional drawbridge , hunker down and everything 'll be fine , in today 's globalised world , i just do n't see that as an available strategy for us . "
douglas hurd , former foreign secretary " the disaster of iraq has set back the general cause of humanitarian intervention which is why the foreign secretary david miliband now begins to set out the case again .
there is a case , there is a case philosophically for saying it is part of our job to help with others make the world a more decent place , but it does depend on getting your facts right , getting your sums right , making decent plans for the likely future . "
lord -lrb- paddy -rrb- ashdown , former high representative in kosovo " it is n't over when the fighting 's over , and i think the realisation of afghanistan and iraq is that you can win the war but then go on to lose the peace unless you do it properly and structuring your armed forces just to fight the war but also to sustain what kipling called the savage war of peace .

west lancashire council says the plans , which include new shops , bars , cinema , leisure centre and bus station , will give skelmersdale a new heart .
however , in order for the scheme to go ahead , 189 homes in firbeck and findon would have to be demolished .
that has upset some residents living there .
a survey about the plans has been sent to 15,000 homes and firms in the town .
details of the proposal have also gone on display in the concourse shopping centre in skelmersdale .
summer review councillor ian grant , portfolio holder for regeneration , said : " this is an exciting blueprint to pave the way for improvements to the town centre that will benefit everyone who lives and works in skelmersdale .
" the project will bring new jobs and investment , building a new heart for skelmersdale that local people can be proud of . "
the authority says that the properties which could be flattened to make way for the proposed development are no longer suitable for habitation because they are not well designed and do not meet modern standards .
it is proposing to identify a range of sites in skelmersdale where new houses can be built to compensate for the homes if demolition does go ahead .
the masterplan for the proposed revamp is to be finalised in the summer once views have been collated and scrutinised .

however , in order for the scheme to go ahead , 189 homes in firbeck and findon would have to be demolished .
that has upset some residents living there .
a survey about the plans has been sent to 15,000 homes and firms in the town .
details of the proposal have also gone on display in the concourse shopping centre in skelmersdale .
summer review councillor ian grant , portfolio holder for regeneration , said : " this is an exciting blueprint to pave the way for improvements to the town centre that will benefit everyone who lives and works in skelmersdale .
" the project will bring new jobs and investment , building a new heart for skelmersdale that local people can be proud of . "
the authority says that the properties which could be flattened to make way for the proposed development are no longer suitable for habitation because they are not well designed and do not meet modern standards .
it is proposing to identify a range of sites in skelmersdale where new houses can be built to compensate for the homes if demolition does go ahead .
the masterplan for the proposed revamp is to be finalised in the summer once views have been collated and scrutinised .

gustavo rivera martinez was responsible for the logistics of smuggling drugs to the us and laundering the proceeds , mexico 's interior minister said .
he is wanted by the fbi and the us drug enforcement agency which offered a $ 2m -lrb- £ 1m -rrb- reward for his capture .
mr rivera martinez would be sent back immediately to the us , officials said .
" this individual is one of the criminals most sought after by the dea and fbi , " said mexican interior secretary juan camilo mourino .
mr rivera martinez was arrested in the state of baja california sur together with several other suspects .
he had been a fugitive from us justice since 2002 .
mexican officials said mr rivera martinez was a key figure in the tijuana cartel and close to enedina arellano felix , the latest member of the arellano felix family to head the drugs ring .
large reward the arellano felix cartel , based across the us border from san diego , rose to prominence in the 1980s .
it paid millions of dollars in bribes to local law enforcement officers and was blamed for increasing violence , including the murder of informants and rival traffickers .
much of the group 's activities centred on smuggling colombian cocaine through mexico to california .
correspondents say this latest arrest will be seen as a further blow to the cartel whose power has been undermined by a concerted drive against its leaders .
one of its founders , francisco javier arellano felix , was sentenced to life in prison by a us court last year after pleading guilty to running the cartel .
but as the tijuana cartel 's influence has waned , other drugs gangs have tried to move in on its turf .
drug-related violence has become a serious issue across mexico and since taking office in december 2006 , president felipe calderon has sent some 25,000 soldiers and federal police to key areas to tackle the drug-traffickers .

it is hoped that the forum can identify the best way of dealing with the birds which have caused problems in places as far apart as dumfries and aberdeen .
the event is to be jointly hosted by the scottish government and dumfries and galloway council .
environment minister mike russell said he hoped the solutions found in dumfries might be of benefit to communities throughout scotland .
a number of towns and cities have been badly affected by the birds .
in dumfries there have been proposals to " seagull-proof " town centre buildings .
while in aberdeen the council even considered oiling eggs in a bid to reduce bird numbers .

" for too long now large colonies of seagulls have become increasingly problematic in our towns and cities , " he said .
" this can be because of droppings , birds removing litter from bins , noise and even protective parents acting aggressively towards people during the breeding season .
" this is why i have agreed to hold a summit to look at addressing the problems caused by seagulls . "
dumfries provost jack groom said he was pleased the summit was being held .
" gulls are a perennial problem in scottish towns and cities and we have a particular problem in dumfries , " he said .
