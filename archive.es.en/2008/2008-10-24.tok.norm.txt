" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .
and that people like hu jia do n't belong in prison , but should be celebrated as heroes . matthias von hein is the head of dw-radio 's chinese service . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .

but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "

the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.10.2008 concerns arise over germany 's go-it-alone finance plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe have accused germany of just looking out for no. 1 the german government has failed in dealing with the current finance crisis , says former foreign minister joschka fischer .
indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .
23 , " the finance crisis promotes a particular kind of nationalistic or even patriotic thinking . " the dutch paper volkskrant agreed , but said it did n't want to lump all europeans together .
paris and london were working together to find a solution at the eu level , wrote the paper ; it was just germany which was behaving passively in the crisis . post-war germany earned reliable reputation both volkskrant and the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- quoted former german chancellor helmut schmidt , who had warned that germany should never again be one thing : incalculable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin take some tips from its national eleven ?
but , according to some , that 's exactly what it 's becoming .
john vinocur wrote in the iht that over the last several decades post-war germany had won trust in its politics based on three main pillars : its involvement in the eu , its established position in western alliances , and its competence and credibility had all made germany calculable . " at decisive moments , these qualities offered vast reassurance to its friends , " vinocur wrote .
" now , in a period of severe economic unrest , the germany of autumn 2008 resembles its former self less and less . " in a time of serious crisis , the quality of germany 's government and its leadership becomes apparent , commented fischer in a column for the online edition of die zeit . " in the current finance crisis , the government 's two main actors - angela merkel and her finance minister - did n't withstand the test , " he wrote . playing the national card germany plays an important role for europe in this global finance crisis because it is by far the largest and most important economy in the eu , added the former greens figurehead .
that 's why the other european countries looked to berlin - " and were bitterly disappointed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer it 's understandable that germany did n't want a european crisis fund , continued fischer , but the government should have made other suggestions for a common policy in europe . in the end , germany " played the national card instead of taking care of europe , " he criticized , adding that the result was not only anger and disgust from paris and london but also concern and mistrust . zigzag course not surprising however , political scientist jan techau said he does n't think these concerns are appropriate .
techau is project manager at the alfred von oppenheim center for european studies at the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
he said the impression that germany is taking its own path could only have flared up for a short time - particularly around oct .
5 , when chancellor merkel told the german public in a speech that their money was secure . but just a few days later , germany became a team player once again when it worked out a crisis plan with other eu members at the emergency summit in paris , said techau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has joined in on eu finance talks , like earlier this month in paris germany has taken a " zigzag course , which was also taken by other countries in this crisis , where no one really knew what the right plan was , " he added , naming britain 's gordon brown as an example . although the prime minister was vehemently opposed to the nationalization of banks at first , that was " the same gordon brown who proposed and did just than when london 's financial center was faltering . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.10.2008 concerns arise over germany 's go-it-alone finance plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some in europe have accused germany of just looking out for no. 1 the german government has failed in dealing with the current finance crisis , says former foreign minister joschka fischer .
indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .
23 , " the finance crisis promotes a particular kind of nationalistic or even patriotic thinking . " the dutch paper volkskrant agreed , but said it did n't want to lump all europeans together .
paris and london were working together to find a solution at the eu level , wrote the paper ; it was just germany which was behaving passively in the crisis . post-war germany earned reliable reputation both volkskrant and the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- quoted former german chancellor helmut schmidt , who had warned that germany should never again be one thing : incalculable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin take some tips from its national eleven ?
but , according to some , that 's exactly what it 's becoming .
john vinocur wrote in the iht that over the last several decades post-war germany had won trust in its politics based on three main pillars : its involvement in the eu , its established position in western alliances , and its competence and credibility had all made germany calculable . " at decisive moments , these qualities offered vast reassurance to its friends , " vinocur wrote .
" now , in a period of severe economic unrest , the germany of autumn 2008 resembles its former self less and less . " in a time of serious crisis , the quality of germany 's government and its leadership becomes apparent , commented fischer in a column for the online edition of die zeit . " in the current finance crisis , the government 's two main actors - angela merkel and her finance minister - did n't withstand the test , " he wrote . playing the national card germany plays an important role for europe in this global finance crisis because it is by far the largest and most important economy in the eu , added the former greens figurehead .
that 's why the other european countries looked to berlin - " and were bitterly disappointed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer it 's understandable that germany did n't want a european crisis fund , continued fischer , but the government should have made other suggestions for a common policy in europe . in the end , germany " played the national card instead of taking care of europe , " he criticized , adding that the result was not only anger and disgust from paris and london but also concern and mistrust . zigzag course not surprising however , political scientist jan techau said he does n't think these concerns are appropriate .
techau is project manager at the alfred von oppenheim center for european studies at the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
he said the impression that germany is taking its own path could only have flared up for a short time - particularly around oct .
5 , when chancellor merkel told the german public in a speech that their money was secure . but just a few days later , germany became a team player once again when it worked out a crisis plan with other eu members at the emergency summit in paris , said techau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has joined in on eu finance talks , like earlier this month in paris germany has taken a " zigzag course , which was also taken by other countries in this crisis , where no one really knew what the right plan was , " he added , naming britain 's gordon brown as an example . although the prime minister was vehemently opposed to the nationalization of banks at first , that was " the same gordon brown who proposed and did just than when london 's financial center was faltering . "
he did the same with tighter regulations for the financial market , commented techau . distraction from the real issue but no one in europe , or in the us , was prepared for this kind of rapidly developing finance crisis . " it 's not a glorious chapter in history - not just for germany , but for all the european nations , " said techau , adding that it 's understandable that opinions changed quickly when the situation worsened . bringing helmut schmidt 's big historical lesson into play is going too far , according to techau .

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?

public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .
23 , " the finance crisis promotes a particular kind of nationalistic or even patriotic thinking . " the dutch paper volkskrant agreed , but said it did n't want to lump all europeans together .
paris and london were working together to find a solution at the eu level , wrote the paper ; it was just germany which was behaving passively in the crisis . post-war germany earned reliable reputation both volkskrant and the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- quoted former german chancellor helmut schmidt , who had warned that germany should never again be one thing : incalculable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin take some tips from its national eleven ?
but , according to some , that 's exactly what it 's becoming .
john vinocur wrote in the iht that over the last several decades post-war germany had won trust in its politics based on three main pillars : its involvement in the eu , its established position in western alliances , and its competence and credibility had all made germany calculable . " at decisive moments , these qualities offered vast reassurance to its friends , " vinocur wrote .
" now , in a period of severe economic unrest , the germany of autumn 2008 resembles its former self less and less . " in a time of serious crisis , the quality of germany 's government and its leadership becomes apparent , commented fischer in a column for the online edition of die zeit . " in the current finance crisis , the government 's two main actors - angela merkel and her finance minister - did n't withstand the test , " he wrote . playing the national card germany plays an important role for europe in this global finance crisis because it is by far the largest and most important economy in the eu , added the former greens figurehead .
that 's why the other european countries looked to berlin - " and were bitterly disappointed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer it 's understandable that germany did n't want a european crisis fund , continued fischer , but the government should have made other suggestions for a common policy in europe . in the end , germany " played the national card instead of taking care of europe , " he criticized , adding that the result was not only anger and disgust from paris and london but also concern and mistrust . zigzag course not surprising however , political scientist jan techau said he does n't think these concerns are appropriate .

indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .
23 , " the finance crisis promotes a particular kind of nationalistic or even patriotic thinking . " the dutch paper volkskrant agreed , but said it did n't want to lump all europeans together .
paris and london were working together to find a solution at the eu level , wrote the paper ; it was just germany which was behaving passively in the crisis . post-war germany earned reliable reputation both volkskrant and the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- quoted former german chancellor helmut schmidt , who had warned that germany should never again be one thing : incalculable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin take some tips from its national eleven ?
but , according to some , that 's exactly what it 's becoming .
john vinocur wrote in the iht that over the last several decades post-war germany had won trust in its politics based on three main pillars : its involvement in the eu , its established position in western alliances , and its competence and credibility had all made germany calculable . " at decisive moments , these qualities offered vast reassurance to its friends , " vinocur wrote .

" in the current finance crisis , the government 's two main actors - angela merkel and her finance minister - did n't withstand the test , " he wrote . playing the national card germany plays an important role for europe in this global finance crisis because it is by far the largest and most important economy in the eu , added the former greens figurehead .
that 's why the other european countries looked to berlin - " and were bitterly disappointed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer it 's understandable that germany did n't want a european crisis fund , continued fischer , but the government should have made other suggestions for a common policy in europe . in the end , germany " played the national card instead of taking care of europe , " he criticized , adding that the result was not only anger and disgust from paris and london but also concern and mistrust . zigzag course not surprising however , political scientist jan techau said he does n't think these concerns are appropriate .

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .

" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .

al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.10.2008 opinion : chinese dissident deserves eu human rights award großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of the global financial crisis , beijing seems to recognize the important of working together .
but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .
and that people like hu jia do n't belong in prison , but should be celebrated as heroes . matthias von hein is the head of dw-radio 's chinese service . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel vowed closer cooperation with china in view of the global economic crisis .
" we are ready to work even closer with china , especially in times of economic difficulties , " the conservative chancellor said .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .
according to a participant , discussions included chinese sensibilities regarding tibet , as well as taiwan , the developments within china 's society and the effects of the beijing olympic games .
dalai lama visit a source of conflict journalism professor zhan jiang , one of the four chinese participants , told german dpa news agency that the chancellor asked why china had been so annoyed over her meeting the dalai lama .

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.10.2008 opinion : chinese dissident deserves eu human rights award großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of the global financial crisis , beijing seems to recognize the important of working together .
but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .
and that people like hu jia do n't belong in prison , but should be celebrated as heroes . matthias von hein is the head of dw-radio 's chinese service . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .

the german chancellor meanwhile vowed closer cooperation . germany was the european country " which helped china most after this catastrophe , " hu told chancellor angela merkel , who is in beijing to participate in the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- summit on friday and saturday .
" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel vowed closer cooperation with china in view of the global economic crisis .
" we are ready to work even closer with china , especially in times of economic difficulties , " the conservative chancellor said .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .
according to a participant , discussions included chinese sensibilities regarding tibet , as well as taiwan , the developments within china 's society and the effects of the beijing olympic games .
dalai lama visit a source of conflict journalism professor zhan jiang , one of the four chinese participants , told german dpa news agency that the chancellor asked why china had been so annoyed over her meeting the dalai lama .
bilateral relations between china and german deteriorated markedly after a 2007 meeting between merkel and the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader .
" we explained to her that it is very complicated , " zhan said .
" we have a very difficult relationship with the dalai lama . "
sovereignty takes precedence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit with the dalai lama angered china " the germans believe this is just a question of religion and culture , " constitution expert cai dingjian said .
" but for china this is related to national sovereignty . "
" there is much sunshine in the economic relations with germany , but we take our sovereignty very seriously and react harshly when taiwan and tibet are concerned - then it gets dark in the relations , " he added .

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .

“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?

stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .

public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .
the full-body scanners would also eliminate the need for pat-down body searches , they said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" leaders pledged to undertake effective and comprehensive reform of the international monetary and financial systems , " said a statement posted by host china on the asem web site 's home page at the end of the day 's meetings . " they agreed to quickly take appropriate initiatives in this respect , in consultation with all stakeholders and the relevant international financial institutions . " while rhetoric on the reforms remained vague , several leaders called for greater supervision and tougher regulation of the world ’ s financial markets . with relative consistency , most asem participant states called for an approach to the financial crisis that would see asia , europe and america work together in formulating the terms of financial reform . " overcoming the crisis requires global action and a joint response , " chinese premier wen jiabao told the leaders . " asia and europe are important forces in maintaining financial stability and promoting economic growth .
we should join hands to show the world our confidence . " french president nicolas sarkozy called for asia 's help in dealing with the crisis .
" when it comes to the washington summit on nov .
15 , europe is going to present a united front and we will submit well-considered proposals developed together , " he said . " europe would like asia to support that effort , so that together on nov .
15 we can tell the whole world that the causes of this unprecedented crisis will never happen again . "
merkel calls for tighter supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel named close monitoring of money markets and international cooperation as top priorities in a four-point proposal to leaders at asem , german chancellor angela merkel urged greater transparency and firmer controls over financial markets as part of the solution to tackling the financial turmoil .
she listed greater transparency in financial markets as the highest priority for supporting a global recovery .
merkel went on to speak of the need for a new structure of incentives and more control over higher risk equities .
she also said the international monetary fund should play a firmer role as the " guardian of the financial system . "
in an earlier meeting with chinese president hu jintao , merkel said stronger international cooperation and the building of a new financial system were essential for overcoming the financial crisis .
coming together with china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao said relations with germany were strong merkel also vowed closer cooperation with china in view of the crisis .
" we are ready to work even closer with china , especially in times of economic difficulties , " the conservative chancellor said .
germany 's support after the devastating sichuan earthquake in march helped smooth german-chinese relations after past upsets , hu told merkel .
germany was the european country " which helped china most after this catastrophe , " he said .
" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .
according to a participant , discussions included chinese sensibilities regarding tibet , as well as taiwan , the developments within china 's society and the effects of the beijing olympic games . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" leaders pledged to undertake effective and comprehensive reform of the international monetary and financial systems , " said a statement posted by host china on the asem web site 's home page at the end of the day 's meetings . " they agreed to quickly take appropriate initiatives in this respect , in consultation with all stakeholders and the relevant international financial institutions . " while rhetoric on the reforms remained vague , several leaders called for greater supervision and tougher regulation of the world ’ s financial markets . with relative consistency , most asem participant states called for an approach to the financial crisis that would see asia , europe and america work together in formulating the terms of financial reform . " overcoming the crisis requires global action and a joint response , " chinese premier wen jiabao told the leaders . " asia and europe are important forces in maintaining financial stability and promoting economic growth .
we should join hands to show the world our confidence . " french president nicolas sarkozy called for asia 's help in dealing with the crisis .
" when it comes to the washington summit on nov .
15 , europe is going to present a united front and we will submit well-considered proposals developed together , " he said . " europe would like asia to support that effort , so that together on nov .
15 we can tell the whole world that the causes of this unprecedented crisis will never happen again . "
merkel calls for tighter supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel named close monitoring of money markets and international cooperation as top priorities in a four-point proposal to leaders at asem , german chancellor angela merkel urged greater transparency and firmer controls over financial markets as part of the solution to tackling the financial turmoil .
she listed greater transparency in financial markets as the highest priority for supporting a global recovery .
merkel went on to speak of the need for a new structure of incentives and more control over higher risk equities .
she also said the international monetary fund should play a firmer role as the " guardian of the financial system . "
in an earlier meeting with chinese president hu jintao , merkel said stronger international cooperation and the building of a new financial system were essential for overcoming the financial crisis .
coming together with china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao said relations with germany were strong merkel also vowed closer cooperation with china in view of the crisis .
" we are ready to work even closer with china , especially in times of economic difficulties , " the conservative chancellor said .
germany 's support after the devastating sichuan earthquake in march helped smooth german-chinese relations after past upsets , hu told merkel .
germany was the european country " which helped china most after this catastrophe , " he said .
" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .
according to a participant , discussions included chinese sensibilities regarding tibet , as well as taiwan , the developments within china 's society and the effects of the beijing olympic games . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consortium , which consists of germany 's siemens , france 's alstom and canada 's bombardier , refused to provide " reliable data " on the safety of the axles , said db chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
a cracked axle was blamed earlier this year for a low-speed ice derailment at cologne station in which nobody was hurt .
passengers have worried since that an axle might fail while one of the trains is moving at the normal cruising speed of between 200 and 300 kilometers per hour .
rail schedules have been disrupted over the past two weeks after the frequency of checks on both ice-t and ice-3 trains was increased after a further crack was found .
" safety has the absolute priority , " said mehdorn on friday .
" we see ourselves as having been left dangling -lrb- by the consortium -rrb- , which has confronted us with unreliable and unclear information . "
he did not elaborate on how long the stoppage would last .
the ice-t model is designed to tilt slightly on curves .
other models of the bullet-nosed red-and-white ice trains - the abbreviation stands for intercity express - were not grounded .
among routes likely to face delays are hamburg-berlin , joined by a popular hourly service that takes just 95 minutes , and a route between the financial centre of frankfurt and the austrian capital vienna , which also employs the ice-t model .

the consortium , which consists of germany 's siemens , france 's alstom and canada 's bombardier , refused to provide " reliable data " on the safety of the axles , said db chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
a cracked axle was blamed earlier this year for a low-speed ice derailment at cologne station in which nobody was hurt .
passengers have worried since that an axle might fail while one of the trains is moving at the normal cruising speed of between 200 and 300 kilometers per hour .
rail schedules have been disrupted over the past two weeks after the frequency of checks on both ice-t and ice-3 trains was increased after a further crack was found .
" safety has the absolute priority , " said mehdorn on friday .
" we see ourselves as having been left dangling -lrb- by the consortium -rrb- , which has confronted us with unreliable and unclear information . "
he did not elaborate on how long the stoppage would last .
the ice-t model is designed to tilt slightly on curves .
other models of the bullet-nosed red-and-white ice trains - the abbreviation stands for intercity express - were not grounded .
among routes likely to face delays are hamburg-berlin , joined by a popular hourly service that takes just 95 minutes , and a route between the financial centre of frankfurt and the austrian capital vienna , which also employs the ice-t model .

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .

but , according to some , that 's exactly what it 's becoming .
john vinocur wrote in the iht that over the last several decades post-war germany had won trust in its politics based on three main pillars : its involvement in the eu , its established position in western alliances , and its competence and credibility had all made germany calculable .

" now , in a period of severe economic unrest , the germany of autumn 2008 resembles its former self less and less .

techau is project manager at the alfred von oppenheim center for european studies at the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
he said the impression that germany is taking its own path could only have flared up for a short time - particularly around oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .
the full-body scanners would also eliminate the need for pat-down body searches , they said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .
the full-body scanners would also eliminate the need for pat-down body searches , they said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.10.2008 opinion : chinese dissident deserves eu human rights award großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of the global financial crisis , beijing seems to recognize the important of working together .
but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .
and that people like hu jia do n't belong in prison , but should be celebrated as heroes . matthias von hein is the head of dw-radio 's chinese service . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .
and that people like hu jia do n't belong in prison , but should be celebrated as heroes . matthias von hein is the head of dw-radio 's chinese service . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .
23 , " the finance crisis promotes a particular kind of nationalistic or even patriotic thinking . " the dutch paper volkskrant agreed , but said it did n't want to lump all europeans together .
paris and london were working together to find a solution at the eu level , wrote the paper ; it was just germany which was behaving passively in the crisis . post-war germany earned reliable reputation both volkskrant and the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- quoted former german chancellor helmut schmidt , who had warned that germany should never again be one thing : incalculable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin take some tips from its national eleven ?
but , according to some , that 's exactly what it 's becoming .
john vinocur wrote in the iht that over the last several decades post-war germany had won trust in its politics based on three main pillars : its involvement in the eu , its established position in western alliances , and its competence and credibility had all made germany calculable . " at decisive moments , these qualities offered vast reassurance to its friends , " vinocur wrote .
" now , in a period of severe economic unrest , the germany of autumn 2008 resembles its former self less and less .

" in the current finance crisis , the government 's two main actors - angela merkel and her finance minister - did n't withstand the test , " he wrote . playing the national card germany plays an important role for europe in this global finance crisis because it is by far the largest and most important economy in the eu , added the former greens figurehead .
that 's why the other european countries looked to berlin - " and were bitterly disappointed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer it 's understandable that germany did n't want a european crisis fund , continued fischer , but the government should have made other suggestions for a common policy in europe . in the end , germany " played the national card instead of taking care of europe , " he criticized , adding that the result was not only anger and disgust from paris and london but also concern and mistrust . zigzag course not surprising however , political scientist jan techau said he does n't think these concerns are appropriate .
techau is project manager at the alfred von oppenheim center for european studies at the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
he said the impression that germany is taking its own path could only have flared up for a short time - particularly around oct .

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .

" leaders pledged to undertake effective and comprehensive reform of the international monetary and financial systems , " said a statement posted by host china on the asem web site 's home page at the end of the day 's meetings . " they agreed to quickly take appropriate initiatives in this respect , in consultation with all stakeholders and the relevant international financial institutions . " while rhetoric on the reforms remained vague , several leaders called for greater supervision and tougher regulation of the world ’ s financial markets . with relative consistency , most asem participant states called for an approach to the financial crisis that would see asia , europe and america work together in formulating the terms of financial reform . " overcoming the crisis requires global action and a joint response , " chinese premier wen jiabao told the leaders . " asia and europe are important forces in maintaining financial stability and promoting economic growth .
we should join hands to show the world our confidence . " french president nicolas sarkozy called for asia 's help in dealing with the crisis .
" when it comes to the washington summit on nov .
15 , europe is going to present a united front and we will submit well-considered proposals developed together , " he said . " europe would like asia to support that effort , so that together on nov .
15 we can tell the whole world that the causes of this unprecedented crisis will never happen again . "
merkel calls for tighter supervision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel named close monitoring of money markets and international cooperation as top priorities in a four-point proposal to leaders at asem , german chancellor angela merkel urged greater transparency and firmer controls over financial markets as part of the solution to tackling the financial turmoil .
she listed greater transparency in financial markets as the highest priority for supporting a global recovery .
merkel went on to speak of the need for a new structure of incentives and more control over higher risk equities .
she also said the international monetary fund should play a firmer role as the " guardian of the financial system . "
in an earlier meeting with chinese president hu jintao , merkel said stronger international cooperation and the building of a new financial system were essential for overcoming the financial crisis .
coming together with china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao said relations with germany were strong merkel also vowed closer cooperation with china in view of the crisis .
" we are ready to work even closer with china , especially in times of economic difficulties , " the conservative chancellor said .
germany 's support after the devastating sichuan earthquake in march helped smooth german-chinese relations after past upsets , hu told merkel .
germany was the european country " which helped china most after this catastrophe , " he said .
" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .
according to a participant , discussions included chinese sensibilities regarding tibet , as well as taiwan , the developments within china 's society and the effects of the beijing olympic games . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consortium , which consists of germany 's siemens , france 's alstom and canada 's bombardier , refused to provide " reliable data " on the safety of the axles , said db chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
a cracked axle was blamed earlier this year for a low-speed ice derailment at cologne station in which nobody was hurt .
passengers have worried since that an axle might fail while one of the trains is moving at the normal cruising speed of between 200 and 300 kilometers per hour .
rail schedules have been disrupted over the past two weeks after the frequency of checks on both ice-t and ice-3 trains was increased after a further crack was found .
" safety has the absolute priority , " said mehdorn on friday .
" we see ourselves as having been left dangling -lrb- by the consortium -rrb- , which has confronted us with unreliable and unclear information . "
he did not elaborate on how long the stoppage would last .
the ice-t model is designed to tilt slightly on curves .
other models of the bullet-nosed red-and-white ice trains - the abbreviation stands for intercity express - were not grounded .
among routes likely to face delays are hamburg-berlin , joined by a popular hourly service that takes just 95 minutes , and a route between the financial centre of frankfurt and the austrian capital vienna , which also employs the ice-t model .

" leaders pledged to undertake effective and comprehensive reform of the international monetary and financial systems , " said a statement posted by host china on the asem web site 's home page at the end of the day 's meetings . " they agreed to quickly take appropriate initiatives in this respect , in consultation with all stakeholders and the relevant international financial institutions . " while rhetoric on the reforms remained vague , several leaders called for greater supervision and tougher regulation of the world ’ s financial markets . with relative consistency , most asem participant states called for an approach to the financial crisis that would see asia , europe and america work together in formulating the terms of financial reform . " overcoming the crisis requires global action and a joint response , " chinese premier wen jiabao told the leaders . " asia and europe are important forces in maintaining financial stability and promoting economic growth .
we should join hands to show the world our confidence . " french president nicolas sarkozy called for asia 's help in dealing with the crisis .
" when it comes to the washington summit on nov .
15 , europe is going to present a united front and we will submit well-considered proposals developed together , " he said . " europe would like asia to support that effort , so that together on nov .

merkel went on to speak of the need for a new structure of incentives and more control over higher risk equities .
she also said the international monetary fund should play a firmer role as the " guardian of the financial system . "

germany was the european country " which helped china most after this catastrophe , " he said .
" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .
the full-body scanners would also eliminate the need for pat-down body searches , they said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .
and that people like hu jia do n't belong in prison , but should be celebrated as heroes . matthias von hein is the head of dw-radio 's chinese service . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consortium , which consists of germany 's siemens , france 's alstom and canada 's bombardier , refused to provide " reliable data " on the safety of the axles , said db chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
a cracked axle was blamed earlier this year for a low-speed ice derailment at cologne station in which nobody was hurt .
passengers have worried since that an axle might fail while one of the trains is moving at the normal cruising speed of between 200 and 300 kilometers per hour .
rail schedules have been disrupted over the past two weeks after the frequency of checks on both ice-t and ice-3 trains was increased after a further crack was found .
" safety has the absolute priority , " said mehdorn on friday .
" we see ourselves as having been left dangling -lrb- by the consortium -rrb- , which has confronted us with unreliable and unclear information . "
he did not elaborate on how long the stoppage would last .
the ice-t model is designed to tilt slightly on curves .
other models of the bullet-nosed red-and-white ice trains - the abbreviation stands for intercity express - were not grounded .
among routes likely to face delays are hamburg-berlin , joined by a popular hourly service that takes just 95 minutes , and a route between the financial centre of frankfurt and the austrian capital vienna , which also employs the ice-t model .

the consortium , which consists of germany 's siemens , france 's alstom and canada 's bombardier , refused to provide " reliable data " on the safety of the axles , said db chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
a cracked axle was blamed earlier this year for a low-speed ice derailment at cologne station in which nobody was hurt .
passengers have worried since that an axle might fail while one of the trains is moving at the normal cruising speed of between 200 and 300 kilometers per hour .
rail schedules have been disrupted over the past two weeks after the frequency of checks on both ice-t and ice-3 trains was increased after a further crack was found .
" safety has the absolute priority , " said mehdorn on friday .
" we see ourselves as having been left dangling -lrb- by the consortium -rrb- , which has confronted us with unreliable and unclear information . "
he did not elaborate on how long the stoppage would last .
the ice-t model is designed to tilt slightly on curves .
other models of the bullet-nosed red-and-white ice trains - the abbreviation stands for intercity express - were not grounded .
among routes likely to face delays are hamburg-berlin , joined by a popular hourly service that takes just 95 minutes , and a route between the financial centre of frankfurt and the austrian capital vienna , which also employs the ice-t model .
deutsche bahn said a late thursday derailment by a slow-moving empty ice train in hamburg station appeared to have a different cause , human error . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .

the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .

" i can tell you with complete clarity that we are not going to cooperate in this mischief , " an interior ministry spokeswoman said friday at a government news conference .
nonetheless , german federal police said thursday they would seek to commission an engineering study of the devices .
full-body scanners are already in use at some us airports , as well as at london 's heathrow and amsterdam 's schiphol airports , to speed up security checks and to avoid the hand-frisking of passengers .
eu lawmakers ' opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several body scanning methods are currently in use across the us and europe eu parliamentarians spoke out in droves this week against plans to test the scanners at european airports as an alternative to the current practice of sweeping hand-held metal detectors over travellers ' bodies .
they said using full-body scanners would be a violation of citizens ' privacy .
" this technology has the potential - and , i stress , the potential - to force air passengers to undergo what could be seen as undignified treatment , and this is certainly not a small technical step , " philip bradbourn , a british conservative , said thursday .
the plan to introduce the full-body scanners at airports throughout the eu was voted down by a margin of 361 to 16 with 181 abstentions in the european parliament thursday .
european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .
proponents of the virtual scanners said the devices are capable of detecting ceramic knives and plastic explosives , which are invisible to current detectors .
the full-body scanners would also eliminate the need for pat-down body searches , they said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .

the german chancellor meanwhile vowed closer cooperation . germany was the european country " which helped china most after this catastrophe , " hu told chancellor angela merkel , who is in beijing to participate in the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- summit on friday and saturday .
" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel vowed closer cooperation with china in view of the global economic crisis .
" we are ready to work even closer with china , especially in times of economic difficulties , " the conservative chancellor said .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .
according to a participant , discussions included chinese sensibilities regarding tibet , as well as taiwan , the developments within china 's society and the effects of the beijing olympic games .
dalai lama visit a source of conflict journalism professor zhan jiang , one of the four chinese participants , told german dpa news agency that the chancellor asked why china had been so annoyed over her meeting the dalai lama .
bilateral relations between china and german deteriorated markedly after a 2007 meeting between merkel and the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader .
" we explained to her that it is very complicated , " zhan said .
" we have a very difficult relationship with the dalai lama . "
sovereignty takes precedence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's visit with the dalai lama angered china " the germans believe this is just a question of religion and culture , " constitution expert cai dingjian said .

european lawmakers urged the commission to first carry out a thorough impact assessment to determine whether body scanners are harmful and worth the investment .
civil liberties campaigners reacted angrily to the plans to test the full-body scanners , which they said amounted to nothing more than a virtual strip search .

indeed , some in europe are worried that berlin is taking its own path . since the german government rejected an eu aid fund in response to the finance crisis , concerns have arisen in some european countries that germany will go it alone once again . the liberal finnish daily hufvudstadsbladet wrote on thursday , oct .
23 , " the finance crisis promotes a particular kind of nationalistic or even patriotic thinking . " the dutch paper volkskrant agreed , but said it did n't want to lump all europeans together .
paris and london were working together to find a solution at the eu level , wrote the paper ; it was just germany which was behaving passively in the crisis . post-war germany earned reliable reputation both volkskrant and the international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- quoted former german chancellor helmut schmidt , who had warned that germany should never again be one thing : incalculable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should berlin take some tips from its national eleven ?
but , according to some , that 's exactly what it 's becoming .
john vinocur wrote in the iht that over the last several decades post-war germany had won trust in its politics based on three main pillars : its involvement in the eu , its established position in western alliances , and its competence and credibility had all made germany calculable . " at decisive moments , these qualities offered vast reassurance to its friends , " vinocur wrote .
" now , in a period of severe economic unrest , the germany of autumn 2008 resembles its former self less and less . " in a time of serious crisis , the quality of germany 's government and its leadership becomes apparent , commented fischer in a column for the online edition of die zeit . " in the current finance crisis , the government 's two main actors - angela merkel and her finance minister - did n't withstand the test , " he wrote . playing the national card germany plays an important role for europe in this global finance crisis because it is by far the largest and most important economy in the eu , added the former greens figurehead .
that 's why the other european countries looked to berlin - " and were bitterly disappointed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer it 's understandable that germany did n't want a european crisis fund , continued fischer , but the government should have made other suggestions for a common policy in europe . in the end , germany " played the national card instead of taking care of europe , " he criticized , adding that the result was not only anger and disgust from paris and london but also concern and mistrust . zigzag course not surprising however , political scientist jan techau said he does n't think these concerns are appropriate .
techau is project manager at the alfred von oppenheim center for european studies at the german council on foreign relations in berlin .
he said the impression that germany is taking its own path could only have flared up for a short time - particularly around oct .
5 , when chancellor merkel told the german public in a speech that their money was secure . but just a few days later , germany became a team player once again when it worked out a crisis plan with other eu members at the emergency summit in paris , said techau . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has joined in on eu finance talks , like earlier this month in paris germany has taken a " zigzag course , which was also taken by other countries in this crisis , where no one really knew what the right plan was , " he added , naming britain 's gordon brown as an example . although the prime minister was vehemently opposed to the nationalization of banks at first , that was " the same gordon brown who proposed and did just than when london 's financial center was faltering . "
he did the same with tighter regulations for the financial market , commented techau . distraction from the real issue but no one in europe , or in the us , was prepared for this kind of rapidly developing finance crisis . " it 's not a glorious chapter in history - not just for germany , but for all the european nations , " said techau , adding that it 's understandable that opinions changed quickly when the situation worsened . bringing helmut schmidt 's big historical lesson into play is going too far , according to techau .
that kind of historical pathos is not just inappropriate , but distracts from the important economic debate at hand , he said . martin schrader -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german chancellor meanwhile vowed closer cooperation . germany was the european country " which helped china most after this catastrophe , " hu told chancellor angela merkel , who is in beijing to participate in the asia-europe meeting -lrb- asem -rrb- summit on friday and saturday .
" this is a clear sign of friendship from the german government to the chinese people , " he added .
merkel vowed closer cooperation with china in view of the global economic crisis .
" we are ready to work even closer with china , especially in times of economic difficulties , " the conservative chancellor said .
merkel then met with chinese intellectuals at a beijing hotel .
according to a participant , discussions included chinese sensibilities regarding tibet , as well as taiwan , the developments within china 's society and the effects of the beijing olympic games .
dalai lama visit a source of conflict journalism professor zhan jiang , one of the four chinese participants , told german dpa news agency that the chancellor asked why china had been so annoyed over her meeting the dalai lama .
bilateral relations between china and german deteriorated markedly after a 2007 meeting between merkel and the dalai lama , tibet 's exiled spiritual leader .

" but for china this is related to national sovereignty . "
" there is much sunshine in the economic relations with germany , but we take our sovereignty very seriously and react harshly when taiwan and tibet are concerned - then it gets dark in the relations , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 24.10.2008 opinion : chinese dissident deserves eu human rights award großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in light of the global financial crisis , beijing seems to recognize the important of working together .
but it ca n't overlook the fact that human rights are universal , says dw 's matthias von hein . the european parliament was n't intimidated by the threats of the chinese leadership .
it awarded the sakharov prize to a person who is more than deserving of this award for " freedom of expression " for his gentle , yet relentless resistance .
imprisonment , house arrest - nothing could intimidate 35-year-old hu jia . in november 2007 , hu jia participated via internet in a european parliamentary hearing even as guards waited in front of his door and his telephone was tapped .
he did n't spare any criticism for the human rights violations in china and spoke of a human rights catastrophe in the olympic host country . mock trial for hu a month later , when most foreign journalists were on christmas vacation , hu jia was arrested .
his trial was organized in april at record speed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias von hein the trial itself was wrapped up extremely quickly : the chinese judges needed just one day to sentence him to three-and-a-half years in prison for " subversion . "
the result of this mock trial was enough for the chinese foreign ministry to condemn hu jia as a criminal and castigate his winning the award as interference in china 's interior affairs . awarding hu jia the sakharov prize is just as right as the timing is unfavorable .
it coincides with german chancellor angela merkel 's efforts in beijing to normalize german-chinese relations after she received the dalai lama over a year ago .
and the prize came one day before the heads of over 40 states discuss strategies for overcoming the financial crisis at the asia-europe summit -lrb- asem -rrb- . china feels effects of crisis but with its $ 1.9-trillion -lrb- 1.49 trillion euros -rrb- currency reserve , china does n't only have good leverage .
despite its insular banking system , it 's been hit hard by the crisis .
the chinese stock index has lost 65 percent of its value .
exports are nose-diving .
laid-off workers in southern china are already picketing in front of walled-up toy factories . beijing also seems to have learned from the crisis just how dependent we all are on one another .
that 's the only explanation for the surprisingly soft tone the foreign ministry spokesman took after his criticism of the european parliament .
he said awarding hu jia the sakharov prize would not have an impact on the asem summit . maybe the chinese government has realized that european parliaments ca n't be compared to the national people 's congress .
as true representatives of the people , they have a life of their own - independent of the government .
in any case , beijing has seldom been so calm in the face of criticism from abroad . perhaps it 's naive , but it would be nice if , after the insight that joint action is necessary in the world of finance , it also became clear that human rights are universal , even in this globalized world .
and that people like hu jia do n't belong in prison , but should be celebrated as heroes . matthias von hein is the head of dw-radio 's chinese service . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .

the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" they agreed to quickly take appropriate initiatives in this respect , in consultation with all stakeholders and the relevant international financial institutions . " while rhetoric on the reforms remained vague , several leaders called for greater supervision and tougher regulation of the world ’ s financial markets . with relative consistency , most asem participant states called for an approach to the financial crisis that would see asia , europe and america work together in formulating the terms of financial reform . " overcoming the crisis requires global action and a joint response , " chinese premier wen jiabao told the leaders . " asia and europe are important forces in maintaining financial stability and promoting economic growth .
we should join hands to show the world our confidence . " french president nicolas sarkozy called for asia 's help in dealing with the crisis .
" when it comes to the washington summit on nov .

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .

the consortium , which consists of germany 's siemens , france 's alstom and canada 's bombardier , refused to provide " reliable data " on the safety of the axles , said db chief executive hartmut mehdorn .
a cracked axle was blamed earlier this year for a low-speed ice derailment at cologne station in which nobody was hurt .
passengers have worried since that an axle might fail while one of the trains is moving at the normal cruising speed of between 200 and 300 kilometers per hour .
rail schedules have been disrupted over the past two weeks after the frequency of checks on both ice-t and ice-3 trains was increased after a further crack was found .
" safety has the absolute priority , " said mehdorn on friday .
" we see ourselves as having been left dangling -lrb- by the consortium -rrb- , which has confronted us with unreliable and unclear information . "
he did not elaborate on how long the stoppage would last .
the ice-t model is designed to tilt slightly on curves .
other models of the bullet-nosed red-and-white ice trains - the abbreviation stands for intercity express - were not grounded .
among routes likely to face delays are hamburg-berlin , joined by a popular hourly service that takes just 95 minutes , and a route between the financial centre of frankfurt and the austrian capital vienna , which also employs the ice-t model .
deutsche bahn said a late thursday derailment by a slow-moving empty ice train in hamburg station appeared to have a different cause , human error . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corporate governance -pipe- 24.10.2008 experts divided over executive pay curbs in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is debating capping the salaries of its widely perceived overpaid bank executives the bank crisis has reignited a debate over executive pay in germany .
public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public pressure and board oversight can curb excesses but rules on salary caps and bans on golden parachutes are less effective , say experts . a heated debate in germany about curbing executive pay and holding managers personally liable for huge losses at banks in the wake of the global financial turmoil came to a head this week with a number of german bankers being asked to return their bonuses . the former chief executive of the bankrupt mortgage lender ikb now has to return last year ’ s 805,000 euro remuneration to his ex-employer .
stefan ortseifen was charged for making the private bank germany ’ s first victim of the sub-prime crisis , according to the thursday edition of sueddeutsche zeitung . four other top managers were also similarly charged , and one of them even voluntarily returned the 558,000 euros that ikb claimed he didn ’ t deserve , according to germany 's mass circulation bild newpaper . when ikb collapsed last year , heralding the arrival of the banking crisis from across the atlantic , european leaders had already started calling for the heads of overpaid corporate bosses responsible for driving their companies into the ground .
now they ’ re taking action . golden parachutes and the fat cat tax in the next few months , france ’ s president nicolas sarkozy wants to enact legislation to ban such “ golden parachutes ” that guarantee generous severance payouts to parting executives who mismanage the companies they run . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch finance minster wants " fat cat tax " on bountiful bonuses dutch finance minister wouter bos , leader of the dutch labour party , has proposed a draft law to impose a 30 percent “ fat cat tax ” increase on high bonuses and golden parachutes . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel ’ s cabinet hammered out a deal to limit executive salaries to 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 666,000 -rrb- as part of a half-trillion euro emergency bank bailout .
whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whether managers would have to forego bonuses and dividend payouts however is unclear . german government sets salary caps experts agree with politicians on the need to rein in management excesses , but are divided over whether governments ought to be the ones setting caps on executive compensation . marcus lutter , a law professor at the university of bonn and a member of the german government ’ s commission on corporate governance , finds the cap “ absolutely fine . ” “ as long as these banks are indebted to the state and the german taxpayer is bearing the cost of their mistakes , there has to be this upper limit , ” said lutter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikb bankwas germany 's first victim of the sub-prime crisis putting a ceiling on executive pay is a political response to public pressure , according to joachim schwalbach , professor of international management at berlin ’ s humboldt university . “ this is a populist tactic to show ordinary people that the government is in control , ” he said . “ it shouldn ’ t be up to the german parliament to set the arbitrary pay caps , that ’ s the job of corporate supervisory boards ” , he added . executive compensation expert klaus-stefan hohenstatt , a senior partner at the global law firm freshfields bruckhaus deringer , pointed out that the problem with the proposed 500,000-euro cap is that it is simply too low to attract the top talent needed to reform deeply troubled banks . the average remuneration for managers at german blue chip companies listed on the dax is roughly three million euros , with chief executives earning two or three times more than their board colleagues .
but hohenstatt , who characterised the cap as a “ guideline , not a strict rule ” said he expected the government to be very flexible about upping the limits if the need arose .
porsche executive got more than 60 million euros besides , said hohenstatt , there is nothing wrong with big pay packages for top executives who are worth their weight in gold , such as porsche ’ s wendelin wiedeking who walked away with at least 60 million euros last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche ceo wiedeking is germany 's highest paid executive “ as long as executives are not drawing big bonuses while the company is being downsized and shareholder value is dropping , the public is not so upset , ” he said . “ porsche had brilliant results , so everyone down to the assembly line worker gets generous year end bonuses and the shareholders get their fat dividend .
everyone ’ s happy , ” he added . marcus lutter disagrees .
“ regardless of how spectacular a manager ’ s performance is , are his achievements worth over 60 million euros ?
this is an outrageous sum , ” he said , pointing out that angela merkel ’ s annual salary is only 261,500 euros . “ is it fair for bankers to be making double the amount of our chancellor ? ” he asked . german pay scales between us and japan humboldt university ’ s schwalbach said that what is viewed as excessive compensation is in part a cultural matter .
in japan , prime minister taro aso ’ s salary is comparable to merkel ’ s , but also on par with that of his corporate cousins . “ take toyota .
although it is one of the most profitable automakers in the world , the ceo gets a very small portion of what top managers earn in america , so executive pay has nothing to do with company performance , ” he said , adding that germany falls between the japan and the us , where executive remuneration in salary and stock options is by far the highest in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : board manager earns 52 times more than average worker over the past twenty years though , the pay gap between germany ’ s top dax managers and the average workers has widened considerably .
last year the average board manager earned 52 times more than the average worker , according to schwalbach ’ s survey . public outrage over golden parachutes it is this widening differential at a time when companies announce massive job cuts that has fuelled public outrage over fat cats in the boardroom , who wind up being rewarded with golden parachutes in spite of a poor track record . freshfields ’ hohenstatt says that part of the problem is that it ’ s not easy to fire an executive , whose contract typically extends for five years in germany . “ he would have had to act in clearly criminal way or fail in the business sense in the absolute extreme .
these high payments kick in when there is no legal ground for termination and when there plenty of time left on the contract , ” he said . marcus lutter puts the onus on the supervisory board to keep tabs on managers who step out of line . “ a law banning golden parachutes wouldn ’ t be nearly as effective as boards doing a vigilant job of monitoring compensation issues as well as the performance of their hand-picked chief executives , ” he said . public outrage helps too , to keep the pressure on the supervisory board , he added . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

al qaeda in islamic north africa , which is also known as the al qaeda organization in the land of the islamic maghreb , claimed responsibility for attacks last december in algiers , targeting the un headquarters there and the algerian constitutional court .
the bombings killed at least 70 people .
the terror group has also been at the heart of a string of attacks this year , including a strike east of algiers on sept .
28 which killed three people and wounded six others .
but uhrlau said similar incursions in the future may not necessarily be contained to within north africa .
al qaeda in islamic north africa " is not just in close geographic proximity to europe , " he said at a berlin security conference .
" it is also presently the al qaeda franchise that is developing the most dynamically . "
uhrlau said there was a " high " chance the group could seek to expand its operations into europe .
the bnd president also warned the internet was becoming a " vehicle for preparations " for aspirant terrorists seeking to organize future attacks .
born of the civil war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the algerian militant group aligned itself with al qaeda leader osama bin laden in 2007 al qaeda in islamic north africa was formed out of a militant faction - the salafist group for preaching and combat - which had been left over from the algerian civil war in the 1990s .
the group assumed its current identity after aligning itself with osama bin laden 's international network in early 2007 and taking on a more modern islamist agenda .
shortly after this reorientation , a spate of deadly bombings echoed throughout algeria 's kabylia region killing six people .
in april 2007 , at least 30 people were killed in attacks on official buildings in algiers .
following these bombings , attacks were reported on buses carrying foreign oil workers , on diplomats , soldiers , and , finally , against the motorcade of algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , who was not harmed , though 20 others were killed in the blast . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brecon jazz attracted acts including cerys matthews , joan armatrading and courtney pine to its 25th annual festival which took place in august .
in the letter the festival says it hopes to have a full picture of funds available to it by the end of october .
it also asks creditors to send the amounts owed to them to their office .
in the letter , which is dated october 2008 , the hsbc brecon jazz board said it was taking professional advice and speaking to key stakeholders to establish whether there were ways in which it could obtain additional funds to cover the deficit .
" the advice we have received is that all creditors must be treated equally and that no individual creditor should be preferred over another , " the letter states .
maximise funds " therefore , for a limited period , we are suspending all payments till such times as we have a full picture of the funds available to us and the extent of our liabilities . "
the board goes on to say that it was making every effort to obtain payment from its own debtors to maximise the funds available to make payments .
the letter states : " the company wishes to apologise to its contractors and other supporters for this unfortunate state of affairs and asks for their continued patience in what is a difficult time for all . "
the festival has become a major event on the uk jazz calendar and is renowned for its street music as well as its concert line-up .
it regularly attracts around 70,000 revellers to the mid wales town and receives funding and assistance from a number of organisations including the arts council of wales , hsbc , powys council and the brecon beacons national park association .
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said it was aware of the current funding difficulties being faced by brecon jazz .
the heritage minister will discuss the matter with the arts council of wales at their next meeting , the spokesperson said .
" whilst the welsh assembly government does not provide direct financial support to brecon jazz , the event does receive funding of almost £ 125,000 via the arts council of wales .
" as one of a number of funders , the arts council of wales is currently working with the festival to consider viable options for the future . "

brecon jazz attracted acts including cerys matthews , joan armatrading and courtney pine to its 25th annual festival which took place in august .
in the letter the festival says it hopes to have a full picture of funds available to it by the end of october .
it also asks creditors to send the amounts owed to them to their office .
in the letter , which is dated october 2008 , the hsbc brecon jazz board said it was taking professional advice and speaking to key stakeholders to establish whether there were ways in which it could obtain additional funds to cover the deficit .
" the advice we have received is that all creditors must be treated equally and that no individual creditor should be preferred over another , " the letter states .
maximise funds " therefore , for a limited period , we are suspending all payments till such times as we have a full picture of the funds available to us and the extent of our liabilities . "
the board goes on to say that it was making every effort to obtain payment from its own debtors to maximise the funds available to make payments .
the letter states : " the company wishes to apologise to its contractors and other supporters for this unfortunate state of affairs and asks for their continued patience in what is a difficult time for all . "
the festival has become a major event on the uk jazz calendar and is renowned for its street music as well as its concert line-up .
it regularly attracts around 70,000 revellers to the mid wales town and receives funding and assistance from a number of organisations including the arts council of wales , hsbc , powys council and the brecon beacons national park association .
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said it was aware of the current funding difficulties being faced by brecon jazz .

the court did not , in the end , ban the akp , as many commentators had predicted it would .

religious matters have been " turned into central issues in politics at a scale leading to social divisions " , the document said .
the court , however , stressed that the akp had also undertaken reforms to improve human rights .
" it is obvious the party has used the powers of government to bring the country in line with the standards of modern western democracies , " it said .
explaining why it had rejected prosecutors ' demands to ban the akp , the court said there was no evidence that the party had been seeking to undermine secularism through violence .
as a result , the court said , the party had been stripped of half of the state funds it was entitled to this year .

the court was explaining why it it imposed financial sanctions on the governing ak party in july .
but it said that while pm recep tayyip erdogan and other akp leaders had broken secular principles , they had not promoted violence .
the court did not , in the end , ban the akp , as many commentators had predicted it would .
the case pitted the secular elite against the akp .
the party has denied it wants to create an islamist state by stealth .
the party , which has islamist roots , won re-election in polls last year .
funding cut in their ruling published on friday , the judges cited the akp 's efforts to promote religious education and its aborted attempt to abolish a ban on wearing headscarves in universities as violations of secular principles .
religious matters have been " turned into central issues in politics at a scale leading to social divisions " , the document said .
the court , however , stressed that the akp had also undertaken reforms to improve human rights .
" it is obvious the party has used the powers of government to bring the country in line with the standards of modern western democracies , " it said .
explaining why it had rejected prosecutors ' demands to ban the akp , the court said there was no evidence that the party had been seeking to undermine secularism through violence .
as a result , the court said , the party had been stripped of half of the state funds it was entitled to this year .

the national weights and measures laboratory -lrb- nwml -rrb- is considering new food and drink measures to give consumers more choice .
the nwml will look at introducing two-thirds of a pint alongside current measures like half or full pints .
the licensed trade had called for more choice when serving drinks , especially those with more alcohol , the nwml said .
the alcohol proposals are separate to eu regulations that will relax rules on the sizes of pre-packaged goods from april next year .
other proposals being considered by the nwml include allowing pubs and bars to serve wine measures of less than 75ml -lrb- 0.16 pint -rrb- for tasting and sampling .
a third of a pint is already a legal measure , but it has fallen out of common usage .
consumer choice and because food measures will be included in the consultation , unwrapped bread could also be sold in any size to give producers and consumers more choice .
an nwml spokesman said on thursday : " the proposals on food packaging published for consultation today are aimed at boosting consumer choice while giving more freedom to uk businesses to both respond to the demands of customers and compete on a level playing field .
" we are also consulting over specific proposals from the pub and restaurant industries on the introduction of new measures for alcohol including smaller measures of wine for sampling and tasting and a new imperial measure for draught beer and cider of two thirds of a pint . "
the consultation will run until january .

other proposals being considered by the nwml include allowing pubs and bars to serve wine measures of less than 75ml -lrb- 0.16 pint -rrb- for tasting and sampling .
a third of a pint is already a legal measure , but it has fallen out of common usage .
consumer choice and because food measures will be included in the consultation , unwrapped bread could also be sold in any size to give producers and consumers more choice .
an nwml spokesman said on thursday : " the proposals on food packaging published for consultation today are aimed at boosting consumer choice while giving more freedom to uk businesses to both respond to the demands of customers and compete on a level playing field .
" we are also consulting over specific proposals from the pub and restaurant industries on the introduction of new measures for alcohol including smaller measures of wine for sampling and tasting and a new imperial measure for draught beer and cider of two thirds of a pint . "
the consultation will run until january .

by tom geoghegan bbc news magazine the uk 's economic output has fallen for the first time since 1992 , when the country was emerging from a recession that had lasted nearly two years .
so what was britain like at the start of the last downturn and what 's happened to people who suffered then ?
on 5 december 1990 , the uk was enduring a cold snap and on the way was a fierce snowstorm that brought much of the country to a standstill .
those hoping for a thaw could draw no respite from the music charts , where vanilla ice was just beginning his three weeks at the top , with ice , ice , baby .

the 1990 recession : how the news broke such signs were ominous , for an economic chill had been descending for months and this led chancellor norman lamont to stand up on that day and tell mps that the uk was entering a recession .
eighteen years later prime minister gordon brown has warned of the same possibility and on friday , gdp figures showed the economy shrank for the first time since the end of that downturn in 1992 .
mr lamont 's speech hardly came as a shock .
the country 's gdp had just recorded its sharpest drop in 10 years and retail sales in october had fallen 1.1 % , a much bigger drop than expected .
inflation was in double figures and interest rates were recently as high as 15 % .
what else happened in 1990 ?

one of britain 's longest serving prime ministers , margaret thatcher , had only one week earlier bade a tearful farewell at downing street , handing the keys over to john major .
after the boom of the 1980s , britain 's hangover was starting to kick in , with bankruptcies and repossessions mounting , and dole queues lengthening .
even owners of michelin-starred restaurants were n't spared .
with 30 years of experience in the business , patrick mcdonald , 46 , now says 1991 was financially his toughest year .
he had opened his bistro in the spring of 1990 but 18 months later it went under , despite being part of one of the top restaurants in the country at the time : the epicurean in stow-on-the-wold .
what 's the real impact of the economic slowdown ?
bbc news is taking the temperature across the uk in a special day of coverage special report : the downturn " the recession bit harder and harder and harder and one of the high street banks we were mortgaged with decided that it was vulnerable and they called in the mortgage even though we had been paying it .
" it was not only my business but a home for my wife and children .
it put us under immense pressure because we did n't have a home to live in . "
he put the property into voluntary liquidation but before literally throwing the keys at the bank representatives , he stripped out all the fittings - radiators , lights , water boiler - and sold them back to the business that moved in .
that enabled him to pay back some of the creditors .
mr mcdonald bounced back from his bistro going under but he bounced back .
the family rented a home , he later set up a consultancy advising chefs and his comeback was sealed when he became one of the first television chefs to host a reality show - channel 4 's if you ca n't stand the heat .
" i 've been knocked down a few times but come through .
i 've employed thousands of people over 30 years and created a lot of jobs and if i was to sit back and not do anything i would be nothing . "
a year after the bistro closed , another small business was folding a couple of hundred miles east , in norwich .
severe struggle tom mackeown set up rags to riches in 1985 , designing and selling upmarket women 's wear , but a few years later its troubles began , when the pound suddenly climbed nearly 15 % in value against other currencies , making its exports very expensive .
coupled with two wet summers washing out the county shows at which he sold , it was a fatal blow .
we struggled severely for two years tom mackeown " it was one of the first times when the pound climbed against the other currencies , so our clothes became unaffordable .
" and because we had borrowed fairly extensively to expand , without the turnover there was no profit margin to pay the bank and we closed the business in 1992 . "
the family kept their house but struggled severely for a few years as they paid back creditors , giving up their car and holidays abroad .
now mr mackeown runs a building firm called designer stubble that uses natural materials like straw and clay , and he says that as long as there is enough money to feed his four children , then he 's happy .
the problems with the value of sterling , that contributed to the downfall of his business , were at the heart of the economic problems of the times .
with interest rates rising and house prices tumbling , the obvious solution would have been to lower interest rates .
but the government 's economic policy was built around shadowing the strong german mark - as part of british membership of the exchange rate mechanism or erm .
although the uk was technically out of recession by the time it left erm on so-called black wednesday in september 1992 , its effect continued to be painfully felt , especially in areas that remained in negative equity .
sarah stewart , now 48 , believes it cost her her marriage .
three years after buying her flat in newcastle for £ 18,000 in 1991 , she moved south to start a new job and tried to sell it but it was now worth less than she paid for it .
an offer came in for £ 15,000 but the lending bank - as many did at the time - said that was too low .
meanwhile it was regularly getting broken into , so repair costs were mounting .
" i handed back the keys because i could n't cope with it anymore , " says ms stewart , which is not her real name at her request .
brown followed in lamont 's footsteps " i was so close to having a nervous breakdown and i just knew i had to get shot of it .
i thought that was it , until five years later , when i had my first baby , a letter arrived on the doormat from the bank , saying they sold it for £ 1,300 and so i owed them £ 17,000 . "
after a two-year battle , the bank finally settled at a much lower amount but by then the fight had taken its toll on her relationship and she split up with her husband .
the financial repercussions also remain .
" i 've never recovered my earning potential .
i lost two years of my life fighting this claim , then years and years of never being able to buy another house .
" it really affected me long-term .
my husband left me , leaving me bringing up two kids on my own . "
as a new recession looms , scars from the last one suggest it will be a long road to recovery .
below is a selection of your comments .
in the early 90s i 'd recently bought a house on an interest only mortgage with little equity following a divorce .
the value of the house dropped into negative equity and interest rates hit 15 % .
i was unable to sell and ended up servicing the mortgage using an overdraft .
it took me over 5 years to clear the overdraft .
i still live in the same house but now the mortgage is only about 40 % of the property value , even allowing for the depressed housing market .
if i can stay employed during the current recession i 'll be happy -lrb- no certainty there as i 'm an it worker for an investment bank -rrb- .
rob lovett , swindon , uk i was 17 years old at the time .
i was an a-level student living at home ; i had no job , no mortgage , no debts .
" the recession " was just some boring rubbish that they talked about on the news .
i was more interested in girls and the happy mondays .
this time , though - as an employed homeowner juggling rising fuel bills with credit card debts - i am realising what all the concern was about .
dave damon , huddersfield , uk anyone under about 38 will probably not have experience of what the recession of the early 90s was like .
i was made redundant twice in the 90s and with a young family with just one income it was quite unpleasant .
negative equity will be a new experience for many who have over stretched themselves in a housing market that just had to nowhere else to go but down -lrb- 50 % i would guess -rrb- .
perhaps this is the reality check we all need ?
nick , gosport i remember the recession very well , me and my boyfriend had just bought our first house and moved in after renovating for over a year in december 1990 by january 1991 my boyfriend had been made redundant , as he had been with the firm for less than 2 years he did n't receive any redundancy pay , he was out of work for 10 weeks , so i suppose we were lucky , but during those 10 weeks it was so very difficult , as we were n't married we did n't get any financial help whatsoever , our house had devalued so we could n't sell up , but in 2000 we sold that house and made a huge profit , so there is hope when the recession is over .
elaine , coventry , england fortunately we have a more credible monetary policy than in the 90 's ; a more experienced prime minister and better social agenda that looks out for people .
it 's not avoiding the knocks that is a measure of leadership , it 's how you deal with them .
ben , bristol i do n't think the recession of the early 80s ever really ended for some : i left school in 1985 to almost zero employment for fellow pupils , went to college and qualified just in time for the nineties one , and by then employers were wise to how desperate people were for a gainful job .
all around me friends were being bullied into minimum-wage jobs due to fear of being on benefits .
i was dumped by such an employer at the end of last year -lrb- thankfully -rrb- .
scraping around for bits of work has been a necessity to a large part of the population for years - so i might ask what recession ?
grrr jordan , wirral i worked as an administrator at a building society that was known for risky mortgages .
when the recession hit , it got taken over and most of us were made redundant .
after 3 months of not being able to get a decent job i became a cocktail bartender then went to do some further studies .
i 'm now a university lecturer .
sometimes these things work out for the better .
bob , london i was too young to know much about the last recession but my dad told me the other day that business got so bad they were weeks away from having to sell our family home .
i was so shocked that they had been through that hell and i 'd been so blissfully unaware .
i feel desperately for all the men today who are in the same position as my father was then , with kids to support and a home to look after .
sf , reading my girlfriend -lrb- now my wife -rrb- and i bought a flat in northolt in 1988 for £ 65,000 .
a few years later it was worth £ 35,000 - £ 40,000 , and we had a 100 % mortgage .
we could n't sell the flat because of negative equity , so we rented it out and went abroad until 2001 , which was the best thing we ever did .
backrubber , hitchin , uk what baffles me is how quickly folks seem to forget , and how those in politics and finance have the gall to feign surprise .
i was only 18 at the time of the last recession , and i 'm certainly no expert in economics , but it was so blatantly obvious that this was going to happen again , i 've been warning friends for the past three or four years to downsize , or even sell up and rent for a year or two , until prices drop .
the banks ' iniquitous policy of offering huge mortgages -lrb- on the basis that price houses will rise - a self-fulfilling prophecy , as it is precisely this easy availability of money that pushes prices up -rrb- is largely to blame .
the markets had clearly got unsustainably high , and the bubble was just waiting to burst .
i expect people will blame the government for the recession , and i ca n't say i entirely disagree , but then again , last time round , as the article points out , the tories had been in power for over a decade .
they 're all as bad as each other .

by tom geoghegan bbc news magazine the uk 's economic output has fallen for the first time since 1992 , when the country was emerging from a recession that had lasted nearly two years .
so what was britain like at the start of the last downturn and what 's happened to people who suffered then ?
on 5 december 1990 , the uk was enduring a cold snap and on the way was a fierce snowstorm that brought much of the country to a standstill .
those hoping for a thaw could draw no respite from the music charts , where vanilla ice was just beginning his three weeks at the top , with ice , ice , baby .

the 1990 recession : how the news broke such signs were ominous , for an economic chill had been descending for months and this led chancellor norman lamont to stand up on that day and tell mps that the uk was entering a recession .
eighteen years later prime minister gordon brown has warned of the same possibility and on friday , gdp figures showed the economy shrank for the first time since the end of that downturn in 1992 .
mr lamont 's speech hardly came as a shock .
the country 's gdp had just recorded its sharpest drop in 10 years and retail sales in october had fallen 1.1 % , a much bigger drop than expected .
inflation was in double figures and interest rates were recently as high as 15 % .
what else happened in 1990 ?

one of britain 's longest serving prime ministers , margaret thatcher , had only one week earlier bade a tearful farewell at downing street , handing the keys over to john major .
after the boom of the 1980s , britain 's hangover was starting to kick in , with bankruptcies and repossessions mounting , and dole queues lengthening .
even owners of michelin-starred restaurants were n't spared .
with 30 years of experience in the business , patrick mcdonald , 46 , now says 1991 was financially his toughest year .
he had opened his bistro in the spring of 1990 but 18 months later it went under , despite being part of one of the top restaurants in the country at the time : the epicurean in stow-on-the-wold .
what 's the real impact of the economic slowdown ?
bbc news is taking the temperature across the uk in a special day of coverage special report : the downturn " the recession bit harder and harder and harder and one of the high street banks we were mortgaged with decided that it was vulnerable and they called in the mortgage even though we had been paying it .
" it was not only my business but a home for my wife and children .
it put us under immense pressure because we did n't have a home to live in . "
he put the property into voluntary liquidation but before literally throwing the keys at the bank representatives , he stripped out all the fittings - radiators , lights , water boiler - and sold them back to the business that moved in .
that enabled him to pay back some of the creditors .
mr mcdonald bounced back from his bistro going under but he bounced back .
the family rented a home , he later set up a consultancy advising chefs and his comeback was sealed when he became one of the first television chefs to host a reality show - channel 4 's if you ca n't stand the heat .
" i 've been knocked down a few times but come through .
i 've employed thousands of people over 30 years and created a lot of jobs and if i was to sit back and not do anything i would be nothing . "
a year after the bistro closed , another small business was folding a couple of hundred miles east , in norwich .
severe struggle tom mackeown set up rags to riches in 1985 , designing and selling upmarket women 's wear , but a few years later its troubles began , when the pound suddenly climbed nearly 15 % in value against other currencies , making its exports very expensive .
coupled with two wet summers washing out the county shows at which he sold , it was a fatal blow .
we struggled severely for two years tom mackeown " it was one of the first times when the pound climbed against the other currencies , so our clothes became unaffordable .
" and because we had borrowed fairly extensively to expand , without the turnover there was no profit margin to pay the bank and we closed the business in 1992 . "
the family kept their house but struggled severely for a few years as they paid back creditors , giving up their car and holidays abroad .
now mr mackeown runs a building firm called designer stubble that uses natural materials like straw and clay , and he says that as long as there is enough money to feed his four children , then he 's happy .
the problems with the value of sterling , that contributed to the downfall of his business , were at the heart of the economic problems of the times .
with interest rates rising and house prices tumbling , the obvious solution would have been to lower interest rates .
but the government 's economic policy was built around shadowing the strong german mark - as part of british membership of the exchange rate mechanism or erm .
although the uk was technically out of recession by the time it left erm on so-called black wednesday in september 1992 , its effect continued to be painfully felt , especially in areas that remained in negative equity .
sarah stewart , now 48 , believes it cost her her marriage .
three years after buying her flat in newcastle for £ 18,000 in 1991 , she moved south to start a new job and tried to sell it but it was now worth less than she paid for it .
an offer came in for £ 15,000 but the lending bank - as many did at the time - said that was too low .
meanwhile it was regularly getting broken into , so repair costs were mounting .
" i handed back the keys because i could n't cope with it anymore , " says ms stewart , which is not her real name at her request .
brown followed in lamont 's footsteps " i was so close to having a nervous breakdown and i just knew i had to get shot of it .
i thought that was it , until five years later , when i had my first baby , a letter arrived on the doormat from the bank , saying they sold it for £ 1,300 and so i owed them £ 17,000 . "
after a two-year battle , the bank finally settled at a much lower amount but by then the fight had taken its toll on her relationship and she split up with her husband .
the financial repercussions also remain .
" i 've never recovered my earning potential .
i lost two years of my life fighting this claim , then years and years of never being able to buy another house .
" it really affected me long-term .
my husband left me , leaving me bringing up two kids on my own . "
as a new recession looms , scars from the last one suggest it will be a long road to recovery .
below is a selection of your comments .
in the early 90s i 'd recently bought a house on an interest only mortgage with little equity following a divorce .
the value of the house dropped into negative equity and interest rates hit 15 % .
i was unable to sell and ended up servicing the mortgage using an overdraft .
it took me over 5 years to clear the overdraft .
i still live in the same house but now the mortgage is only about 40 % of the property value , even allowing for the depressed housing market .
if i can stay employed during the current recession i 'll be happy -lrb- no certainty there as i 'm an it worker for an investment bank -rrb- .
rob lovett , swindon , uk i was 17 years old at the time .
i was an a-level student living at home ; i had no job , no mortgage , no debts .
" the recession " was just some boring rubbish that they talked about on the news .
i was more interested in girls and the happy mondays .
this time , though - as an employed homeowner juggling rising fuel bills with credit card debts - i am realising what all the concern was about .
dave damon , huddersfield , uk anyone under about 38 will probably not have experience of what the recession of the early 90s was like .
i was made redundant twice in the 90s and with a young family with just one income it was quite unpleasant .
negative equity will be a new experience for many who have over stretched themselves in a housing market that just had to nowhere else to go but down -lrb- 50 % i would guess -rrb- .
perhaps this is the reality check we all need ?
nick , gosport i remember the recession very well , me and my boyfriend had just bought our first house and moved in after renovating for over a year in december 1990 by january 1991 my boyfriend had been made redundant , as he had been with the firm for less than 2 years he did n't receive any redundancy pay , he was out of work for 10 weeks , so i suppose we were lucky , but during those 10 weeks it was so very difficult , as we were n't married we did n't get any financial help whatsoever , our house had devalued so we could n't sell up , but in 2000 we sold that house and made a huge profit , so there is hope when the recession is over .
elaine , coventry , england fortunately we have a more credible monetary policy than in the 90 's ; a more experienced prime minister and better social agenda that looks out for people .
it 's not avoiding the knocks that is a measure of leadership , it 's how you deal with them .
ben , bristol i do n't think the recession of the early 80s ever really ended for some : i left school in 1985 to almost zero employment for fellow pupils , went to college and qualified just in time for the nineties one , and by then employers were wise to how desperate people were for a gainful job .
all around me friends were being bullied into minimum-wage jobs due to fear of being on benefits .
i was dumped by such an employer at the end of last year -lrb- thankfully -rrb- .
scraping around for bits of work has been a necessity to a large part of the population for years - so i might ask what recession ?
grrr jordan , wirral i worked as an administrator at a building society that was known for risky mortgages .
when the recession hit , it got taken over and most of us were made redundant .
after 3 months of not being able to get a decent job i became a cocktail bartender then went to do some further studies .
i 'm now a university lecturer .
sometimes these things work out for the better .
bob , london i was too young to know much about the last recession but my dad told me the other day that business got so bad they were weeks away from having to sell our family home .
i was so shocked that they had been through that hell and i 'd been so blissfully unaware .
i feel desperately for all the men today who are in the same position as my father was then , with kids to support and a home to look after .
sf , reading my girlfriend -lrb- now my wife -rrb- and i bought a flat in northolt in 1988 for £ 65,000 .
a few years later it was worth £ 35,000 - £ 40,000 , and we had a 100 % mortgage .
we could n't sell the flat because of negative equity , so we rented it out and went abroad until 2001 , which was the best thing we ever did .
backrubber , hitchin , uk what baffles me is how quickly folks seem to forget , and how those in politics and finance have the gall to feign surprise .
i was only 18 at the time of the last recession , and i 'm certainly no expert in economics , but it was so blatantly obvious that this was going to happen again , i 've been warning friends for the past three or four years to downsize , or even sell up and rent for a year or two , until prices drop .
the banks ' iniquitous policy of offering huge mortgages -lrb- on the basis that price houses will rise - a self-fulfilling prophecy , as it is precisely this easy availability of money that pushes prices up -rrb- is largely to blame .
the markets had clearly got unsustainably high , and the bubble was just waiting to burst .
i expect people will blame the government for the recession , and i ca n't say i entirely disagree , but then again , last time round , as the article points out , the tories had been in power for over a decade .
they 're all as bad as each other .

by tom geoghegan bbc news magazine the uk 's economic output has fallen for the first time since 1992 , when the country was emerging from a recession that had lasted nearly two years .
so what was britain like at the start of the last downturn and what 's happened to people who suffered then ?
on 5 december 1990 , the uk was enduring a cold snap and on the way was a fierce snowstorm that brought much of the country to a standstill .
those hoping for a thaw could draw no respite from the music charts , where vanilla ice was just beginning his three weeks at the top , with ice , ice , baby .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
the 1990 recession : how the news broke such signs were ominous , for an economic chill had been descending for months and this led chancellor norman lamont to stand up on that day and tell mps that the uk was entering a recession .
eighteen years later prime minister gordon brown has warned of the same possibility and on friday , gdp figures showed the economy shrank for the first time since the end of that downturn in 1992 .
mr lamont 's speech hardly came as a shock .
the country 's gdp had just recorded its sharpest drop in 10 years and retail sales in october had fallen 1.1 % , a much bigger drop than expected .
inflation was in double figures and interest rates were recently as high as 15 % .
what else happened in 1990 ?
films : edward scissorhands , pretty woman , home alone sport : gazza cried , sir alex ferguson was seven minutes from the sack as man utd manager music : sinead o 'connor , happy mondays , primal scream television : twin peaks , baywatch , the simpsons in the news : geoffrey howe resigned , thatcher ousted , 100 british hostages freed by iraq the political world was equally stormy .
one of britain 's longest serving prime ministers , margaret thatcher , had only one week earlier bade a tearful farewell at downing street , handing the keys over to john major .
after the boom of the 1980s , britain 's hangover was starting to kick in , with bankruptcies and repossessions mounting , and dole queues lengthening .
even owners of michelin-starred restaurants were n't spared .
with 30 years of experience in the business , patrick mcdonald , 46 , now says 1991 was financially his toughest year .
he had opened his bistro in the spring of 1990 but 18 months later it went under , despite being part of one of the top restaurants in the country at the time : the epicurean in stow-on-the-wold .
what 's the real impact of the economic slowdown ?
bbc news is taking the temperature across the uk in a special day of coverage special report : the downturn " the recession bit harder and harder and harder and one of the high street banks we were mortgaged with decided that it was vulnerable and they called in the mortgage even though we had been paying it .
" it was not only my business but a home for my wife and children .
it put us under immense pressure because we did n't have a home to live in . "
he put the property into voluntary liquidation but before literally throwing the keys at the bank representatives , he stripped out all the fittings - radiators , lights , water boiler - and sold them back to the business that moved in .
that enabled him to pay back some of the creditors .
mr mcdonald bounced back from his bistro going under but he bounced back .
the family rented a home , he later set up a consultancy advising chefs and his comeback was sealed when he became one of the first television chefs to host a reality show - channel 4 's if you ca n't stand the heat .
" i 've been knocked down a few times but come through .
i 've employed thousands of people over 30 years and created a lot of jobs and if i was to sit back and not do anything i would be nothing . "
a year after the bistro closed , another small business was folding a couple of hundred miles east , in norwich .
severe struggle tom mackeown set up rags to riches in 1985 , designing and selling upmarket women 's wear , but a few years later its troubles began , when the pound suddenly climbed nearly 15 % in value against other currencies , making its exports very expensive .
coupled with two wet summers washing out the county shows at which he sold , it was a fatal blow .
we struggled severely for two years tom mackeown " it was one of the first times when the pound climbed against the other currencies , so our clothes became unaffordable .
" and because we had borrowed fairly extensively to expand , without the turnover there was no profit margin to pay the bank and we closed the business in 1992 . "
the family kept their house but struggled severely for a few years as they paid back creditors , giving up their car and holidays abroad .
now mr mackeown runs a building firm called designer stubble that uses natural materials like straw and clay , and he says that as long as there is enough money to feed his four children , then he 's happy .
the problems with the value of sterling , that contributed to the downfall of his business , were at the heart of the economic problems of the times .
with interest rates rising and house prices tumbling , the obvious solution would have been to lower interest rates .
but the government 's economic policy was built around shadowing the strong german mark - as part of british membership of the exchange rate mechanism or erm .
although the uk was technically out of recession by the time it left erm on so-called black wednesday in september 1992 , its effect continued to be painfully felt , especially in areas that remained in negative equity .
sarah stewart , now 48 , believes it cost her her marriage .
three years after buying her flat in newcastle for £ 18,000 in 1991 , she moved south to start a new job and tried to sell it but it was now worth less than she paid for it .
an offer came in for £ 15,000 but the lending bank - as many did at the time - said that was too low .
meanwhile it was regularly getting broken into , so repair costs were mounting .
" i handed back the keys because i could n't cope with it anymore , " says ms stewart , which is not her real name at her request .
brown followed in lamont 's footsteps " i was so close to having a nervous breakdown and i just knew i had to get shot of it .
i thought that was it , until five years later , when i had my first baby , a letter arrived on the doormat from the bank , saying they sold it for £ 1,300 and so i owed them £ 17,000 . "
after a two-year battle , the bank finally settled at a much lower amount but by then the fight had taken its toll on her relationship and she split up with her husband .
the financial repercussions also remain .
" i 've never recovered my earning potential .
i lost two years of my life fighting this claim , then years and years of never being able to buy another house .
" it really affected me long-term .
my husband left me , leaving me bringing up two kids on my own . "
as a new recession looms , scars from the last one suggest it will be a long road to recovery .
below is a selection of your comments .
in the early 90s i 'd recently bought a house on an interest only mortgage with little equity following a divorce .
the value of the house dropped into negative equity and interest rates hit 15 % .
i was unable to sell and ended up servicing the mortgage using an overdraft .
it took me over 5 years to clear the overdraft .
i still live in the same house but now the mortgage is only about 40 % of the property value , even allowing for the depressed housing market .
if i can stay employed during the current recession i 'll be happy -lrb- no certainty there as i 'm an it worker for an investment bank -rrb- .
rob lovett , swindon , uk i was 17 years old at the time .
i was an a-level student living at home ; i had no job , no mortgage , no debts .
" the recession " was just some boring rubbish that they talked about on the news .
i was more interested in girls and the happy mondays .
this time , though - as an employed homeowner juggling rising fuel bills with credit card debts - i am realising what all the concern was about .
dave damon , huddersfield , uk anyone under about 38 will probably not have experience of what the recession of the early 90s was like .
i was made redundant twice in the 90s and with a young family with just one income it was quite unpleasant .
negative equity will be a new experience for many who have over stretched themselves in a housing market that just had to nowhere else to go but down -lrb- 50 % i would guess -rrb- .
perhaps this is the reality check we all need ?
nick , gosport i remember the recession very well , me and my boyfriend had just bought our first house and moved in after renovating for over a year in december 1990 by january 1991 my boyfriend had been made redundant , as he had been with the firm for less than 2 years he did n't receive any redundancy pay , he was out of work for 10 weeks , so i suppose we were lucky , but during those 10 weeks it was so very difficult , as we were n't married we did n't get any financial help whatsoever , our house had devalued so we could n't sell up , but in 2000 we sold that house and made a huge profit , so there is hope when the recession is over .
elaine , coventry , england fortunately we have a more credible monetary policy than in the 90 's ; a more experienced prime minister and better social agenda that looks out for people .
it 's not avoiding the knocks that is a measure of leadership , it 's how you deal with them .
ben , bristol i do n't think the recession of the early 80s ever really ended for some : i left school in 1985 to almost zero employment for fellow pupils , went to college and qualified just in time for the nineties one , and by then employers were wise to how desperate people were for a gainful job .
all around me friends were being bullied into minimum-wage jobs due to fear of being on benefits .
i was dumped by such an employer at the end of last year -lrb- thankfully -rrb- .
scraping around for bits of work has been a necessity to a large part of the population for years - so i might ask what recession ?
grrr jordan , wirral i worked as an administrator at a building society that was known for risky mortgages .
when the recession hit , it got taken over and most of us were made redundant .
after 3 months of not being able to get a decent job i became a cocktail bartender then went to do some further studies .
i 'm now a university lecturer .
sometimes these things work out for the better .
bob , london i was too young to know much about the last recession but my dad told me the other day that business got so bad they were weeks away from having to sell our family home .
i was so shocked that they had been through that hell and i 'd been so blissfully unaware .
i feel desperately for all the men today who are in the same position as my father was then , with kids to support and a home to look after .
sf , reading my girlfriend -lrb- now my wife -rrb- and i bought a flat in northolt in 1988 for £ 65,000 .
a few years later it was worth £ 35,000 - £ 40,000 , and we had a 100 % mortgage .
we could n't sell the flat because of negative equity , so we rented it out and went abroad until 2001 , which was the best thing we ever did .
backrubber , hitchin , uk what baffles me is how quickly folks seem to forget , and how those in politics and finance have the gall to feign surprise .
i was only 18 at the time of the last recession , and i 'm certainly no expert in economics , but it was so blatantly obvious that this was going to happen again , i 've been warning friends for the past three or four years to downsize , or even sell up and rent for a year or two , until prices drop .
the banks ' iniquitous policy of offering huge mortgages -lrb- on the basis that price houses will rise - a self-fulfilling prophecy , as it is precisely this easy availability of money that pushes prices up -rrb- is largely to blame .
the markets had clearly got unsustainably high , and the bubble was just waiting to burst .
i expect people will blame the government for the recession , and i ca n't say i entirely disagree , but then again , last time round , as the article points out , the tories had been in power for over a decade .
they 're all as bad as each other .
end of rant .

twelve years ago , every one of the 60 councillors here was labour .

" so you 'll run a campaign putting the blame for the downturn on immigration ? " , i ask .
it would be remarkable if they did n't .
but side-stepping the question , councillor walker simply says that " the bnp speaks for the silent majority who are looking for something new " and predicts a major breakthrough for the party .
of course major bnp breakthroughs have been predicted before .
since 2004 they have seen steady incremental increases in their support , with the party now having 56 councillors across britain , including a seat on the greater london assembly .
fifty six is still a tiny fraction of the total number of councillors but every bnp councillor elected gets noticed nationally .
the bnp have made strides in some overwhelmingly white , poor parts of the stoke-on-trent area such as bentilee where the party controls all three wards .
shift in focus ?
outside the new , redeveloped shopping centre , several people say they are fed up with the local council and it is the bnp who are promising to do things differently .

one of stoke 's labour mps has noticed a change in the bnp 's approach .
" they are adopting a much more localised , practical , day-to-day , we 're-on-your-side approach to hide what the party fundamentally stands for " , robert flello says .
the recent relative success of the bnp in stoke and other areas such as barking and dagenham has taken place against a benign economic backdrop .
but now there is a recession on the way and dagenham 's labour mp jon cruddas expects the bnp to capitalise on the downturn .
" it will make a qualitative difference in terms of the context within which they 're allowed to perpetuate their scapegoating and myth-making , " he says .
" i 've got a sense of foreboding about what lies ahead . "

former leaders peer out from portraits hanging over the wooden benches .
twelve years ago , every one of the 60 councillors here was labour .
today councillor walker can point to a segment of seating and proudly call it his - the bnp 's .
he is the party 's leader in stoke and their councillors make up the second largest single party group in the chamber . "
in the event of recession we 'll use whatever political campaigning we think will be most effective to gain more bnp votes " alby walker , bnp councillor stoke mayor to go after vote over tea in a cafe , the dapper , silver-haired bnp councillor agrees that an economic downturn could be good for his party 's support .
" in the event of recession we 'll use whatever political campaigning we think will be most effective to gain more bnp votes . "
" so you 'll run a campaign putting the blame for the downturn on immigration ? " , i ask .
it would be remarkable if they did n't .
but side-stepping the question , councillor walker simply says that " the bnp speaks for the silent majority who are looking for something new " and predicts a major breakthrough for the party .
of course major bnp breakthroughs have been predicted before .
since 2004 they have seen steady incremental increases in their support , with the party now having 56 councillors across britain , including a seat on the greater london assembly .
fifty six is still a tiny fraction of the total number of councillors but every bnp councillor elected gets noticed nationally .
the bnp have made strides in some overwhelmingly white , poor parts of the stoke-on-trent area such as bentilee where the party controls all three wards .
shift in focus ?
outside the new , redeveloped shopping centre , several people say they are fed up with the local council and it is the bnp who are promising to do things differently .
" it all comes down to immigration - jobs for us and not for them - and the bnp stand up for that " says one woman . "
i 've got a sense of foreboding about what lies ahead " jon cruddas , labour mp an older lady describes feeling threatened by a recent bnp rally in the area while another man says " if you put all the racial things to one side the bnp are trying to do something for stoke-on-trent " .
one of stoke 's labour mps has noticed a change in the bnp 's approach .
" they are adopting a much more localised , practical , day-to-day , we 're-on-your-side approach to hide what the party fundamentally stands for " , robert flello says .
the recent relative success of the bnp in stoke and other areas such as barking and dagenham has taken place against a benign economic backdrop .
but now there is a recession on the way and dagenham 's labour mp jon cruddas expects the bnp to capitalise on the downturn .
" it will make a qualitative difference in terms of the context within which they 're allowed to perpetuate their scapegoating and myth-making , " he says .
" i 've got a sense of foreboding about what lies ahead . "
he believes government must do more to address some of the complex issues around housing , flexible labour markets and immigration that have enabled the bnp to grow in areas such as his .
economic factors the economically-turbulent 1970s coincided with the rise of the national front in britain .
riots , demonstrations and counter-demonstrations rumbled on through the decade but there was no electoral breakthrough and the movement collapsed , despite the high unemployment of the early 1980s .
experts warns against an easy correlation , saying that even if the economy slumps and far-right support increases , it has always been the case historically that the rise is intermittent , geographically patchy and does not last long .
" although there tends to be a bit of moral panic about it , it 's never really happened in a way that , in any sense , threatens the domination of the political scene by the main parties " professor colin rallings , from plymouth university , says .
but councillor alby walker is eyeing up the other seats in stoke 's council chamber and sees political potential in the coming economic problems .

asda and sainsbury 's said they would slash their petrol prices to as low as 94.9p a litre .
tesco and morrisons also said they would reduce their prices , while petrol company total will follow suit .
the supermarkets have already joined battle on the issue of forecourt prices on several occasions .
' rip off ' sainsbury will cut its petrol prices by 3p per litre .
while its prices are locally set , it did say the majority of customers would pay 94.9p for unleaded and 106.9p for diesel .
no sainsbury customers would pay more than 96.9p for unleaded and 107.9p for diesel , it said .
sainsbury is supporting its announcement with a promotion offering an extra 5p off if customers spend £ 50 in store .
this could mean customers spend less than 90p a litre on fuel for the first time since april 2007 , said the supermarket chain .
meanwhile , asda has said it will freeze prices in all of its 172 forecourts for 10 days , whatever the fluctuations in crude oil prices .
a litre of its petrol will now cost 94.9p , while its diesel will be 107.9p.
" it 's simply not acceptable for anyone to be paying more than £ 1 for a litre of petrol , no matter where they live in the uk , " said asda trading director , darren blackhurst .
" if they are , they 're being ripped off whilst petrol retailers pocket the profit , " he said .
however some observers claimed that supermarkets could afford to sell petrol at a loss to try and win customers into their stores - a luxury which independent fuel retailers could not afford .
price war several consumer groups welcomed the news , with aa president edmund king saying the cuts had come at " just the right time " .
tesco , britain 's largest supermarket , said it would cut its fuel prices by 3p per litre at the majority of its 430 forecourts .
this marks its third price cut in two weeks .
morrisons ' price cut will be its second this week .
on monday it trimmed 2p off a litre , taking its prices down to 97.9p for unleaded and 109.9p for diesel .
supermarkets resumed their long-running price war earlier this month after the price of oil started heading downwards , putting pressure on them to react by cutting their own prices .
the price of oil has continued to slide , despite warnings by producers ' cartel opec that it could cut production rates to stabilise prices .
the rmi petrol retailers association warned prices could rise in the near future , but said they would come down again .
" consumers will see prices rise as we go towards christmas , but they will actually drop further in january , " said an rmi spokesman .
he said a january drop would be due to people traditionally driving less and demand subsequently falling .

" it 's simply not acceptable for anyone to be paying more than £ 1 for a litre of petrol , no matter where they live in the uk , " said asda trading director , darren blackhurst .
" if they are , they 're being ripped off whilst petrol retailers pocket the profit , " he said .

tesco , britain 's largest supermarket , said it would cut its fuel prices by 3p per litre at the majority of its 430 forecourts .
this marks its third price cut in two weeks .
morrisons ' price cut will be its second this week .
on monday it trimmed 2p off a litre , taking its prices down to 97.9p for unleaded and 109.9p for diesel .

the rmi petrol retailers association warned prices could rise in the near future , but said they would come down again .
" consumers will see prices rise as we go towards christmas , but they will actually drop further in january , " said an rmi spokesman .

asda and sainsbury 's said they would slash their petrol prices to as low as 94.9p a litre .
tesco and morrisons also said they would reduce their prices , while petrol company total will follow suit .
the supermarkets have already joined battle on the issue of forecourt prices on several occasions .
' rip off ' sainsbury will cut its petrol prices by 3p per litre .
while its prices are locally set , it did say the majority of customers would pay 94.9p for unleaded and 106.9p for diesel .
no sainsbury customers would pay more than 96.9p for unleaded and 107.9p for diesel , it said .
sainsbury is supporting its announcement with a promotion offering an extra 5p off if customers spend £ 50 in store .
this could mean customers spend less than 90p a litre on fuel for the first time since april 2007 , said the supermarket chain .
meanwhile , asda has said it will freeze prices in all of its 172 forecourts for 10 days , whatever the fluctuations in crude oil prices .

the financial services compensation scheme , which is responsible for sorting out the payments , says the government has agreed in principle with iceland what it calls " an accelerated approach to paying compensation . "
but one of the problems is that landsbanki in iceland is not even in administration yet now under eu law the scheme must pay out within three months unless there are highly exceptional circumstances .
should the uk government step in to compensate all savers caught up in the collapse of icelandic banks ?
were people taking unnecessary risks putting money in those banks - and therefore should not be compensated ?

from my perspective the fact that icesave had been allowed to operate in the uk by the british government provided a certain guarantee that my money would be safe .
however , events earlier this month have scuppered this view and i have now lost all faith in these foreign banking institutions .

the government has put that company into administration and is effectively using the iom depositors ' money to fund guarantees to uk kf savers .

steve , douglas " well done gordon and alistair " andrew rusack , saffron walden gordon brown 's labour government policy is to encourage a savings culture in the uk and therefore if a bank in the uk or overseas fails , the government should support domestic savers 100 % .
well done gordon and alistair for acting promptly and decisively on icesave and kaupthing .

the rules were clear , £ 50,000 were covered not unlimited savings .

it has been a very rude awakening to discover that an interest account in a bank has proved to be the most high risk strategy i could have taken , and that the money men at the top who have taken huge risks gambling away my money have come up smelling of very expensive roses , ready to invest my money when the stock market reaches the bottom .
strange world .
sha n't be trusting any banks anywhere , foreign or otherwise .
diana , llangollen contrast the generous treatment of the -lrb- mainly rich -rrb- customers of icelandic banks and the -lrb- mainly poor bangladeshi community -rrb- customers of first solution money transfer last year .
our government did absolutely nothing to help the latter , who had worked hard to send relatively small amounts back home to their families .
government help is based more on newsworthiness than need .
chris grey , guildford most savers are responsible people looking for the best deal .
kaputhing edge was consistently top of the table with best interest rates .
some of us had no choice but to invest offshore because we are expats and apparently our savings are not welcome in uk banks .
p storey , spain i believed the banks assurance that they were " covered just like any other uk bank " and are grateful the government has stepped in .
i am concerned by the possibility of delays in making a payout - and look forward to seeing a firm timetable for this process .
david , redcar i have lost 5k with ks & f iom .
i await the compensation process .
nobody helped equitable life .
why was this ?
christa bell , " why should other taxpayers bail out these people ? "
leslie hills , gravesend like many others , i was relieved to hear from the chancellor that i am to be compensated from my loss with icesave .
however , as i suspected , there seem to be " complications " in the process created by bureaucrats .
as to those who say the taxpayer should not bail out these savers , i remind them that this is only a small sum , compared to the billions put into british banks , in order to prevent the same fate .
so why should other taxpayers bail out these people ?
leslie hills , gravesend the uk government mis-handled the whole affair and was a key factor in causing the crash .
the use of anti-terrorist laws was clearly not correct and will put the the people of the uk at the bottom of the list .
the biggest uk losers from this will be those with savings in iom , jersey & guernsey - they are being left out in the cold and stand to lose everything .
martin , florida i think that the government should compensate savers .
most savers are just ordinary people thinking that it was safe to put money in icesave .
when you see rates advertised and recommended in uk top buy charts coupled with the fscs guarantee , it would not occur to anybody that this was remotely risky .
if savers are not compensated every saver will rush for the doors and only invest in government backed institutions , which would do irreparable damage to banks and building societies alike .
paul holdstock , ware " i shall definitely be more wary about putting money in both foreign and uk institutions in future " patricia , bolton having retired in april this year i decided to invest £ 30,000 of my pension lump sum in an icesave six month bond and feel i acted responsibly by choosing a bank regulated by the fsa and allowed to operate in the uk by the british government .
i was also careful to invest less than the £ 35,000 guaranteed at the time .
i invested the rest of my capital in national savings income bonds at a much lower rate of interest .
the icesave bond should mature next month but i have no idea how long i shall have to wait for this money .
i have had no communications whatsoever , either by post or e-mail from icesave or the fsa and do not know how to make a claim .
i feel that i , and other investors who acted in good faith , should be compensated in full by the british government , and i shall definitely be more wary about putting money in both foreign and uk institutions in future .
patricia , bolton the government should fight for those people but not pay out from british cash .
gordon needs to get it out of iceland first .
karen , wakefield yes all british citizens resident in the uk and paying uk tax should be compensated .
yes i would be vary wary of investing in non uk banks in the future .
stuart wright , hull " i 'm not assured " steven , oxford i have been waiting for over a week for the money that was in kaupthing edge .
i requested a chaps payment to be transferred on october 10th .
ing had this money on october 15th .
i was told that i would have it in my first direct current account by close of business october 17th but this has not been done .
i 'm now told it " should be monday , october 20th " but i 'm not assured .
steven , oxford ing are talking rubbish regarding the chaps payments from ke accounts that have gone missing .
there are millions of pounds missing from one internet group alone .
we are collating a database - no-one has yet received a chaps payment from ing in so far as we can tell .

i invested the rest of my capital in national savings income bonds at a much lower rate of interest .
the icesave bond should mature next month but i have no idea how long i shall have to wait for this money .
i have had no communications whatsoever , either by post or e-mail from icesave or the fsa and do not know how to make a claim .

the 200,000 people hoping for compensation for money in their icesave accounts could be facing a lengthy wait .
the financial services compensation scheme , which is responsible for sorting out the payments , says the government has agreed in principle with iceland what it calls " an accelerated approach to paying compensation . "
but one of the problems is that landsbanki in iceland is not even in administration yet now under eu law the scheme must pay out within three months unless there are highly exceptional circumstances .
should the uk government step in to compensate all savers caught up in the collapse of icelandic banks ?
were people taking unnecessary risks putting money in those banks - and therefore should not be compensated ?
has the episode made you wary of putting your money in foreign institutions ?
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
the debate is now closed .
most recent comments : i think we all acted in good faith in putting our money into the banks in iceland .
how on earth were we to know this crisis was looming ?
i have money in a fixed term account that is due to mature next month .
i tried to get it out last april when there was a scare but they would n't let me withdraw it .
it this my fault ?
certainly not .
why are we not getting any information as to when our money will be returned to us ?
we are all encouraged to save and when we do , look what happens .
it is awful to be left in limbo like this .
pamela , manchester i believe compensation payments should be paid without any further delay john , harrogate , north yorkshire having thought long and hard about where to put some of my lump sum to get the best return following retirement last year , i , like many others , followed the advice of financial experts in the " money matters " columns of the national papers and opened an icesave account .
from my perspective the fact that icesave had been allowed to operate in the uk by the british government provided a certain guarantee that my money would be safe .
however , events earlier this month have scuppered this view and i have now lost all faith in these foreign banking institutions .
i believe compensation payments should be paid without any further delay .
premium bonds may be the safest place to put my money in the future - no interest / no risk , but a chance of winning a bob or two .
john , harrogate , north yorkshire spare a thought for kaupthing singer isle of man investors who have lost their life savings and are being treated as pariahs by hmg .
their money has been frozen in the uk and will probably be used to pay out uk investors .
financial hit and run robbery .
kate , london i therefore hold the british government responsible for full reimbursement of my funds with interest roger , ross on wye i have £ 80,000 in a two year fixed interest account with icesave .
it matures in january , 2010 .
i invested this money in what was an aaa rated bank at the time .
i am one of many who understood this was a safe investment with a bank that was accepted to trade freely in the uk .
i therefore hold the british government responsible for full reimbursement of my funds with interest .
roger , ross on wye the investors in icelandic banks , including those offshore , should be fully compensated .
there are many expats , overseas volunteers and military staff who have no uk address .
because of anti-money laundering legislation introduced by the government , they are not able to hold a uk bank account and therefore have to put their money offshore .
they are not rich yacht-owners trying to evade tax .
why should people who have cashed in on their uk property and moved abroad lose nearly all their money ?
the fsa gave a licence to landsbanki and kaupthing to provide banking to people in the uk .
the credit rating agencies gave top a rating for the banks .
this led people to believe they were safe banks to invest in .
suddenly , messrs brown and darling impose anti-terrorism rules and confiscate / freeze assets held by the icelandic banks and that precipitated the collapse of the guernsey and isle of man banks .
mark , kingston kaupthing , isle of man was a solvent entity until the heavy handed intervention of the pm and chancellor d bailey , bahrain were people taking unnecessary risks ?
no .
our account was opened with the derbyshire building society which was subsequently taken over by kaupthing .
the derbyshire were very eager to advertise the fact that the 100 % parent guarantee given by derbyshire was to be continued with the new owners .
kaupthing , isle of man was a solvent entity until the heavy handed intervention of the pm and chancellor created a silent run on the bank .
should the government step in to compensate all savers ?
undoubtedly - given that they were culpable in creating much of the mess in the first place .
additionally many of the british citizens impacted by the collapse of the icelandic banks will become burdens on the state if they do not have their deposits returned .
d bailey , bahrain " were people taking unnecessary risks putting money in those banks - and therefore should not be compensated ? "
what risks ?
we 're talking about savings -lrb- yes savings not speculative investments -rrb- and interest was " fully guaranteed " .
choice ?
prudent british citizens living / working abroad are unable to open uk accounts -lrb- thanks to terrorist legislation -rrb- .
tax dodgers ?
tax is payable in the uk or country of residence .
greedy ?
does moneybox recommend listeners to search for the lowest interest rates ?
do you recommend filling-up at the petrol station with the highest prices in order to avoid the risk of contamination ?
in any case the interest would have scarcely matched real price inflation .
angry forgotten victim of the banking crisis .
anonymous , france certainly the government should not punish those who were prudent and made what they believed were safe investments in a bank .
it is not a crime to look for a good interest rate .
this should apply equally to those british citizens living and working abroad who had off-shore accounts because they could not open a uk bank account : we thought our money was safe with the derbyshire isle of man -lrb- later sold to kaupthing -rrb- - what a mistake .
anna , oxford i believe the government should seize all icelandic assets in the uk and the eu should assist .
the icelandic government guaranteed everyone 's saving so they should pay - if necessary we should take control of iceland 's finances until the debts are paid .
doug , norfolk those that chose the offshore route should not be compensated .
they tried to dodge uk tax and so should not benefit from uk taxpayers handouts .
ron spencer , sudbury the uk government directly caused the collapse of kaupthing singer in the isle of man .
most of the assets of that company were held within ks uk .
the government has put that company into administration and is effectively using the iom depositors ' money to fund guarantees to uk kf savers .
british citizens saving in ks iom stand to lose their life savings through this injustice .
uk government should not only guarantee all uk savings but repatriate to iom funds frozen in ks uk by uk government action .
steve , douglas well done gordon and alistair andrew rusack , saffron walden gordon brown 's labour government policy is to encourage a savings culture in the uk and therefore if a bank in the uk or overseas fails , the government should support domestic savers 100 % .
well done gordon and alistair for acting promptly and decisively on icesave and kaupthing .
andrew rusack , saffron walden i left my wallet in the pub , will the taxpayer compensate me ?
the rules were clear , £ 50,000 were covered not unlimited savings .
p wilson , brighton sha n't be trusting any banks anywhere , foreign or otherwise diana , llangollen sadly i have never benefited from a seven figure bankers bonus , so have always taken what i thought were low risk money decisions with my hard earned cash .
it has been a very rude awakening to discover that an interest account in a bank has proved to be the most high risk strategy i could have taken , and that the money men at the top who have taken huge risks gambling away my money have come up smelling of very expensive roses , ready to invest my money when the stock market reaches the bottom .

the 200,000 people hoping for compensation for money in their icesave accounts could be facing a lengthy wait .
the financial services compensation scheme , which is responsible for sorting out the payments , says the government has agreed in principle with iceland what it calls " an accelerated approach to paying compensation . "
but one of the problems is that landsbanki in iceland is not even in administration yet now under eu law the scheme must pay out within three months unless there are highly exceptional circumstances .
should the uk government step in to compensate all savers caught up in the collapse of icelandic banks ?
were people taking unnecessary risks putting money in those banks - and therefore should not be compensated ?
has the episode made you wary of putting your money in foreign institutions ?
we asked for your comments , a selection of which are below .
the debate is now closed .
most recent comments : i think we all acted in good faith in putting our money into the banks in iceland .
how on earth were we to know this crisis was looming ?
i have money in a fixed term account that is due to mature next month .
i tried to get it out last april when there was a scare but they would n't let me withdraw it .
it this my fault ?
certainly not .
why are we not getting any information as to when our money will be returned to us ?
we are all encouraged to save and when we do , look what happens .
it is awful to be left in limbo like this .
pamela , manchester i believe compensation payments should be paid without any further delay john , harrogate , north yorkshire having thought long and hard about where to put some of my lump sum to get the best return following retirement last year , i , like many others , followed the advice of financial experts in the " money matters " columns of the national papers and opened an icesave account .
from my perspective the fact that icesave had been allowed to operate in the uk by the british government provided a certain guarantee that my money would be safe .
however , events earlier this month have scuppered this view and i have now lost all faith in these foreign banking institutions .
i believe compensation payments should be paid without any further delay .
premium bonds may be the safest place to put my money in the future - no interest / no risk , but a chance of winning a bob or two .
john , harrogate , north yorkshire spare a thought for kaupthing singer isle of man investors who have lost their life savings and are being treated as pariahs by hmg .
their money has been frozen in the uk and will probably be used to pay out uk investors .
financial hit and run robbery .
kate , london i therefore hold the british government responsible for full reimbursement of my funds with interest roger , ross on wye i have £ 80,000 in a two year fixed interest account with icesave .
it matures in january , 2010 .
i invested this money in what was an aaa rated bank at the time .
i am one of many who understood this was a safe investment with a bank that was accepted to trade freely in the uk .
i therefore hold the british government responsible for full reimbursement of my funds with interest .
roger , ross on wye the investors in icelandic banks , including those offshore , should be fully compensated .
there are many expats , overseas volunteers and military staff who have no uk address .
because of anti-money laundering legislation introduced by the government , they are not able to hold a uk bank account and therefore have to put their money offshore .
they are not rich yacht-owners trying to evade tax .
why should people who have cashed in on their uk property and moved abroad lose nearly all their money ?
the fsa gave a licence to landsbanki and kaupthing to provide banking to people in the uk .
the credit rating agencies gave top a rating for the banks .
this led people to believe they were safe banks to invest in .
suddenly , messrs brown and darling impose anti-terrorism rules and confiscate / freeze assets held by the icelandic banks and that precipitated the collapse of the guernsey and isle of man banks .
mark , kingston kaupthing , isle of man was a solvent entity until the heavy handed intervention of the pm and chancellor d bailey , bahrain were people taking unnecessary risks ?
no .
our account was opened with the derbyshire building society which was subsequently taken over by kaupthing .
the derbyshire were very eager to advertise the fact that the 100 % parent guarantee given by derbyshire was to be continued with the new owners .
kaupthing , isle of man was a solvent entity until the heavy handed intervention of the pm and chancellor created a silent run on the bank .
should the government step in to compensate all savers ?
undoubtedly - given that they were culpable in creating much of the mess in the first place .
additionally many of the british citizens impacted by the collapse of the icelandic banks will become burdens on the state if they do not have their deposits returned .
d bailey , bahrain " were people taking unnecessary risks putting money in those banks - and therefore should not be compensated ? "
what risks ?
we 're talking about savings -lrb- yes savings not speculative investments -rrb- and interest was " fully guaranteed " .
choice ?
prudent british citizens living / working abroad are unable to open uk accounts -lrb- thanks to terrorist legislation -rrb- .
tax dodgers ?
tax is payable in the uk or country of residence .
greedy ?
does moneybox recommend listeners to search for the lowest interest rates ?
do you recommend filling-up at the petrol station with the highest prices in order to avoid the risk of contamination ?
in any case the interest would have scarcely matched real price inflation .
angry forgotten victim of the banking crisis .
anonymous , france certainly the government should not punish those who were prudent and made what they believed were safe investments in a bank .
it is not a crime to look for a good interest rate .
this should apply equally to those british citizens living and working abroad who had off-shore accounts because they could not open a uk bank account : we thought our money was safe with the derbyshire isle of man -lrb- later sold to kaupthing -rrb- - what a mistake .
anna , oxford i believe the government should seize all icelandic assets in the uk and the eu should assist .
the icelandic government guaranteed everyone 's saving so they should pay - if necessary we should take control of iceland 's finances until the debts are paid .
doug , norfolk those that chose the offshore route should not be compensated .
they tried to dodge uk tax and so should not benefit from uk taxpayers handouts .
ron spencer , sudbury the uk government directly caused the collapse of kaupthing singer in the isle of man .
most of the assets of that company were held within ks uk .
the government has put that company into administration and is effectively using the iom depositors ' money to fund guarantees to uk kf savers .
british citizens saving in ks iom stand to lose their life savings through this injustice .
uk government should not only guarantee all uk savings but repatriate to iom funds frozen in ks uk by uk government action .
steve , douglas well done gordon and alistair andrew rusack , saffron walden gordon brown 's labour government policy is to encourage a savings culture in the uk and therefore if a bank in the uk or overseas fails , the government should support domestic savers 100 % .
well done gordon and alistair for acting promptly and decisively on icesave and kaupthing .
andrew rusack , saffron walden i left my wallet in the pub , will the taxpayer compensate me ?
the rules were clear , £ 50,000 were covered not unlimited savings .
p wilson , brighton sha n't be trusting any banks anywhere , foreign or otherwise diana , llangollen sadly i have never benefited from a seven figure bankers bonus , so have always taken what i thought were low risk money decisions with my hard earned cash .
it has been a very rude awakening to discover that an interest account in a bank has proved to be the most high risk strategy i could have taken , and that the money men at the top who have taken huge risks gambling away my money have come up smelling of very expensive roses , ready to invest my money when the stock market reaches the bottom .
strange world .
sha n't be trusting any banks anywhere , foreign or otherwise .
diana , llangollen contrast the generous treatment of the -lrb- mainly rich -rrb- customers of icelandic banks and the -lrb- mainly poor bangladeshi community -rrb- customers of first solution money transfer last year .
our government did absolutely nothing to help the latter , who had worked hard to send relatively small amounts back home to their families .
government help is based more on newsworthiness than need .
chris grey , guildford most savers are responsible people looking for the best deal .
kaputhing edge was consistently top of the table with best interest rates .
some of us had no choice but to invest offshore because we are expats and apparently our savings are not welcome in uk banks .
p storey , spain i believed the banks assurance that they were " covered just like any other uk bank " and are grateful the government has stepped in .
i am concerned by the possibility of delays in making a payout - and look forward to seeing a firm timetable for this process .
david , redcar i have lost 5k with ks & f iom .
i await the compensation process .
nobody helped equitable life .
why was this ?
christa bell , why should other taxpayers bail out these people ?
leslie hills , gravesend like many others , i was relieved to hear from the chancellor that i am to be compensated from my loss with icesave .
however , as i suspected , there seem to be " complications " in the process created by bureaucrats .
as to those who say the taxpayer should not bail out these savers , i remind them that this is only a small sum , compared to the billions put into british banks , in order to prevent the same fate .
so why should other taxpayers bail out these people ?
leslie hills , gravesend the uk government mis-handled the whole affair and was a key factor in causing the crash .
the use of anti-terrorist laws was clearly not correct and will put the the people of the uk at the bottom of the list .
the biggest uk losers from this will be those with savings in iom , jersey & guernsey - they are being left out in the cold and stand to lose everything .
martin , florida i think that the government should compensate savers .
most savers are just ordinary people thinking that it was safe to put money in icesave .
when you see rates advertised and recommended in uk top buy charts coupled with the fscs guarantee , it would not occur to anybody that this was remotely risky .
if savers are not compensated every saver will rush for the doors and only invest in government backed institutions , which would do irreparable damage to banks and building societies alike .
paul holdstock , ware i shall definitely be more wary about putting money in both foreign and uk institutions in future patricia , bolton having retired in april this year i decided to invest £ 30,000 of my pension lump sum in an icesave six month bond and feel i acted responsibly by choosing a bank regulated by the fsa and allowed to operate in the uk by the british government .
i was also careful to invest less than the £ 35,000 guaranteed at the time .
i invested the rest of my capital in national savings income bonds at a much lower rate of interest .
the icesave bond should mature next month but i have no idea how long i shall have to wait for this money .
i have had no communications whatsoever , either by post or e-mail from icesave or the fsa and do not know how to make a claim .
i feel that i , and other investors who acted in good faith , should be compensated in full by the british government , and i shall definitely be more wary about putting money in both foreign and uk institutions in future .
patricia , bolton the government should fight for those people but not pay out from british cash .
gordon needs to get it out of iceland first .

bulls kept at two farms on the outskirts of inverness are transported to crofting townships in the highlands and islands .
the scheme , managed by the crofters commission , is to be replaced .
with 400 out of 13,000 crofters using the animals , environment minister mike russell said it was in decline .
he said money would be made available for other arrangements .
mr russell said : " to keep the scheme going is now simply not an option .
" people are always fond of what they had in the past and i can understand that . "
he added : " what we are proposing are new arrangements which i think are more suitable for the present time .
" but it is a fact the scheme has not been well taken in recent years . "
crofters have argued the reason for this has been more stringent rules and regulations .
the scheme was introduced to improve the quality of livestock .
kenny macleod , who farms at ness on lewis , said : " my understanding is that the bulls that are here will be given to the people who are using them , but it means wintering them .
" it costs a lot of money to winter a bull .
it will have to be inside from november to april-may and with feed going up and up it will be an added burden on crofters . "
