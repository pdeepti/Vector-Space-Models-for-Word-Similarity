18 that emergency global summits on the finance crisis will be held - the first taking place in the us before the end of november . the announcement was made at the us presidential retreat , camp david , outside washington , where european commission president jose manuel barroso also joined the meeting .
" i look forward to hosting this meeting in the near future , " said bush , who added that developed as well as emerging economies would be included .
" we 're dealing with a significant problem . "
bush and sarkozy , who was representing the 27-member european union as the current president , emphasized their continuing support for free market economies and opposition to protectionism and isolationism .
it is " essential we preserve the foundation of democratic capitalism , " bush said .
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
agreement on the summit was announced immediately after sarkozy and barroso arrived at camp david from an eu-canada summit in quebec city .
sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .
world leaders will also " seek agreement on principles of reform " needed to avoid another failure and " assure global prosperity in the future , " the three men said in the statement .
a global crisis needs a global voice , says sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso and sarkozy brought the eu 's vision to the us " first and foremost , this is a worldwide crisis and we must find a worldwide solution , " sarkozy said .
the goal of the emergency summit , sarkozy said , was to " speak with one and the same voice . "
" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .
un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "
" the sort of capitalism we have witnessed is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in , " he added .
calls for a new " bretton woods " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown aim to rebuild the global finance system both sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown have called for the summit to be a " new bretton woods . "
sarkozy has said it is " necessary to rebuild the entire global financial and monetary system from the bottom up . "
in july 1944 , an agreement was signed in bretton woods , new hampshire , that established new rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states .
sarkozy said eu leaders planned to go to asia next week to discuss the crisis .
the goal of the summit is to discuss ideas about how to prevent the recurrence of the wave of financial failures that have forced governments to intervene hugely in capital markets and the banking system .
sarkozy and barroso also called for the building of a new financial order and new global capitalism system .
sarkozy denounced the failures in the us system that had led to the global crisis .
series of emergency meetings to begin in november the expanded idea of a series of meetings was put forth in a statement issued after the men finished meeting .
the g20 finance ministers are planning to meet from november 7-9 in brazil , but it was not clear if that meeting would be connected to the emergency finance summit .
the g20 includes the g8 most industrialized countries -lrb- us , canada , italy , germany , britain , france , japan , russia -rrb- and argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , and the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only when buddhist monks approcah does he remember that he 's not in his hometonw in the moselle but in burma . aythaya vineyards is the brainchild of bert morsbach , who relocated from thailand years ago , where he manufactured surf boards . almost 10 years ago , he leased a plot of land at an elevation of 1,300 meters near inle lake , about an hour 's flight time north-east of burma 's main port city of yangon . morsbach then experimented a few years with vines imported from germany and consulted numerous wine experts .
eventually , his efforts bore fruit and he went into serious production . about two years ago , he hired leiendecker , 50 , a well-known vintner from the moselle town of bernkastel in western germany , who has won prizes for the excellence of his vintages . now he produces in burma .
about 100,000 bottles of sauvignon blanc are made there every year , and the 2007 vintage is already being touted as a breakthrough success . " the quality is comparable to similar vintages from europe , chile and australia , " leiendecker said . many five-star hotels in the country are carrying the vintage on their wine lists , but it is also served in the restaurant that is part of the vineyard and where leiendecker lives . the terrace with a view of the plantation is currently being expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors . " we need more space to host weddings and company outings , " leiendecker said . more chairs are needed , and more china . " chinese weddings require a lot of small bowls and at least one waiter for every three tables , but at burmese weddings , one waiter is usually enough to tend to up to seven tables , " leiendecker said .

" many people are under the impression that the entire country was devastated by the cyclone , which is , of course , not the case , " leiendecker explained . while the cyclone rampaged through the irrawaddy river delta and the coastline in burma 's south , the rest of the country escaped unharmed . aythaya vineyards is located near inle lake , which , with its stilted bungalow resorts , hotels and rustic villages , used to attract thousands of foreign tourists each year . nowadays , many of the hotels are either closed or deserted . leiendecker has recently begun to raise the output of " kanbosa , " a full and fruity red wine , " rather on the sweet side , " he said . it might not be the choice of an expert red wine lover but caters to local tastes , he said .
" we have to slowly introduce the locals to wine , " leiendecker said . two young women are sitting on stools and pasting labels on filled bottles .
" it 's all done manually here because we do n't have any expensive machinery to do the work , " leiendecker said . the vineyard employs about 60 people and primarily cultures shiraz and sauvignon grapes . pruning the vines takes place in october and harvesting is in april . investor interest despite poor soil and low yield bildunterschrift : the slopes above leiendecker 's hometown are very fertile in comparison to burma since the soil is poorer than in germany 's moselle region and because the vines do not receive much sunshine during the rainy season from april to october , the yield is rather small .

he still is often confronted with doubts about whether one should invest at all in a country under a repressive military regime . " we are n't here because of the military junta but despite of it , " he said . morsbach has fallen in love with the locals and insisted that sanctions and holding back investments would only play into the hands of the military and isolate the population .

new eu immigration pact prompts demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu agreed sweeping measures which tighten laws adopted thursday by leaders of the 27-member european union , the european pact on immigration and asylum - a document of political intent but not binding laws - sets out principles for managing migration , fighting illegal immigration and forming partnerships with countries people leave or travel through to get to europe .

britain 's new immigration minister has already promised to impose tougher restrictions as the country 's unemployment rate looks set to soar to its highest level in nearly a decade .

" there has to be a balance between the number of people coming in and the number of people leaving , " said woolas .
the minister said his government would not allow britain 's population to grow to 70 million people .
britain 's population grew by about 3.4 percent to almost 61 million people between 2001 and 2007 fuelled by expansion of the european union , according to latest figures from the office for national statistics .
britain 's unemployment rate jumped to an eight-year high of 5.7 percent in the three months to august , official data showed on wednesday .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .
tadic looking for un approval before agreeing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic opposes to eulex but un approval could change that serbian president boris tadic said earlier this week that the agreement over eulex deployment between belgrade and the eu was possible , but insisted it could be reached only by obtaining a green light from the un security council for the mission .
de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 19.10.2008 eu justice mission to kosovo targets december start date großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european police and justice officials hope to operational in kosovo by the end of the year the eu police and justice mission in kosovo -lrb- eulex -rrb- could become fully operational in early december , if it overcomes objections from local serb minority to its deployment , according to its chief yves de kermabon . de kermabon - who used to command nato-led peacekeeping troops in kosovo -lrb- kfor -rrb- - estimated that an accord with serbia on eulex 's deployment in kosovo was " not far away " , but said he has remained nevertheless " prudent " .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .
tadic looking for un approval before agreeing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic opposes to eulex but un approval could change that serbian president boris tadic said earlier this week that the agreement over eulex deployment between belgrade and the eu was possible , but insisted it could be reached only by obtaining a green light from the un security council for the mission .
de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .

" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2008 us , eu leaders announce global finance crisis summits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered to host the first planned global summit in the us in november us president george w bush and french president nicolas sarkozy said saturday , oct .
18 that emergency global summits on the finance crisis will be held - the first taking place in the us before the end of november . the announcement was made at the us presidential retreat , camp david , outside washington , where european commission president jose manuel barroso also joined the meeting .
" i look forward to hosting this meeting in the near future , " said bush , who added that developed as well as emerging economies would be included .
" we 're dealing with a significant problem . "
bush and sarkozy , who was representing the 27-member european union as the current president , emphasized their continuing support for free market economies and opposition to protectionism and isolationism .
it is " essential we preserve the foundation of democratic capitalism , " bush said .
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
agreement on the summit was announced immediately after sarkozy and barroso arrived at camp david from an eu-canada summit in quebec city .
sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .
world leaders will also " seek agreement on principles of reform " needed to avoid another failure and " assure global prosperity in the future , " the three men said in the statement .
a global crisis needs a global voice , says sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso and sarkozy brought the eu 's vision to the us " first and foremost , this is a worldwide crisis and we must find a worldwide solution , " sarkozy said .
the goal of the emergency summit , sarkozy said , was to " speak with one and the same voice . "
" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .
un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "

britain 's new immigration minister has already promised to impose tougher restrictions as the country 's unemployment rate looks set to soar to its highest level in nearly a decade .
" it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " phil woolas told the times newspaper in an interview published saturday .
in a dramatic change of policy , the labour government intends to place a limit on immigration , according to the daily .
" there has to be a balance between the number of people coming in and the number of people leaving , " said woolas .
the minister said his government would not allow britain 's population to grow to 70 million people .
britain 's population grew by about 3.4 percent to almost 61 million people between 2001 and 2007 fuelled by expansion of the european union , according to latest figures from the office for national statistics .
britain 's unemployment rate jumped to an eight-year high of 5.7 percent in the three months to august , official data showed on wednesday .
the 5.7-percent unemployment rate was the highest since the three months to march , 2000 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .

in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .

" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .

in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2008 spanish couples prefer bad marriage over bad money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish couples are willing to ride out the financial crisis in loveless marriages people may marry for love , but divorce is about money , as spain 's deepening economic crisis is making clear .
this year 's slowdown and the credit crunch affecting banks are cutting divorce rates by as much as 30 percent . " it has become extremely difficult for couples wanting to divorce to sell their home at a reasonable price , and the crisis is also making it harder to maintain two separate households , " madrid divorce lawyer antonio prada told the dpa news agency .
as a result , couples which no longer have anything to say to each other stay under the same roof , developing what prada calls " new forms of living together . "
divorce rates went into a clear decline earlier this year , when the meltdown of spain 's key property sector and the international economic conjuncture put an abrupt end to more than a decade of uninterrupted growth .
growth has now plunged from 3.8 percent in 2007 to close to zero , and unemployment has soared past 10 per cent .
prices of used housing dropped by more than 10 per cent in the first nine months of this year , according to the property valuation company tinsa .
bailout plans could have an effect on marriages the government is now planning to inject up to 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 200 billion -rrb- into the financial system to shore up banks .
if the plan fails , the collapse of housing prices and the difficulties to obtain mortgages could discourage divorces further , analysts say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a couple 's differences may not be as serious as bankruptcy " couples which intended to divorce may even stay together permanently , " prada says .
" the economic crisis would thus help to preserve marriages " in cases where the partners have at least friendly relations , he explains .
couples which can not stand the sight of each other , however , are resorting to " internet divorces " based on standard contracts supplied by law firms charging low fees .
this is not necessarily leading to happier times for those involved though .
" contracts supplied over the internet always create problems , because they do not deal with the details of dividing property , child custody and other specifics in each individual case , " prada warns .
the number of divorces has increased steadily since spain legalized the procedure in 1981 , with more than 100,000 couples untying the knot annually .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government made divorce easier in 2005 .
however , prada says the reform did not increase divorces on a large scale , because its main novelty - the abolition of the concept of the guilty party - was already being applied in practice .
adult kids coming back to the familial home while the economic slump is turning estranged couples into reluctant flatmates , it is having a similar impact on parents and their adult children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grown-up children are moving back with their folks rising unemployment and difficulties in obtaining mortgages or credit to launch businesses is making increasing numbers of people aged more than 30 years stay with their parents or return to the family home if they have left .
the phenomenon became visible already in 2007 , when the number of people moving out of their parents ' homes increased only 2.8 percent , down from 5 per cent in previous years , said jose luis arroyo of the spanish youth council .
" in spain , portugal or italy , the family still plays an important role " compared to northern or central europe , which offer more social benefits to young people seeking to become independent from their parents , arroyo told the daily el pais . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only when buddhist monks approcah does he remember that he 's not in his hometonw in the moselle but in burma . aythaya vineyards is the brainchild of bert morsbach , who relocated from thailand years ago , where he manufactured surf boards . almost 10 years ago , he leased a plot of land at an elevation of 1,300 meters near inle lake , about an hour 's flight time north-east of burma 's main port city of yangon . morsbach then experimented a few years with vines imported from germany and consulted numerous wine experts .
eventually , his efforts bore fruit and he went into serious production . about two years ago , he hired leiendecker , 50 , a well-known vintner from the moselle town of bernkastel in western germany , who has won prizes for the excellence of his vintages . now he produces in burma .
about 100,000 bottles of sauvignon blanc are made there every year , and the 2007 vintage is already being touted as a breakthrough success . " the quality is comparable to similar vintages from europe , chile and australia , " leiendecker said . many five-star hotels in the country are carrying the vintage on their wine lists , but it is also served in the restaurant that is part of the vineyard and where leiendecker lives . the terrace with a view of the plantation is currently being expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors . " we need more space to host weddings and company outings , " leiendecker said . more chairs are needed , and more china . " chinese weddings require a lot of small bowls and at least one waiter for every three tables , but at burmese weddings , one waiter is usually enough to tend to up to seven tables , " leiendecker said .
" just three years ago , i would never have dreamed that i once would have to distinguish between chinese and burmese weddings , " he added . wine market focused locally the vineyard has to focus its marketing locally because burma 's tourism industry is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monk-led demos brought unwanted publicity last year 's brutal suppression by the ruling military junta of monk-led protests and the subsequent devastation left behind by cyclone nargis in may have resulted in dwindling tourist numbers . " many people are under the impression that the entire country was devastated by the cyclone , which is , of course , not the case , " leiendecker explained . while the cyclone rampaged through the irrawaddy river delta and the coastline in burma 's south , the rest of the country escaped unharmed . aythaya vineyards is located near inle lake , which , with its stilted bungalow resorts , hotels and rustic villages , used to attract thousands of foreign tourists each year . nowadays , many of the hotels are either closed or deserted . leiendecker has recently begun to raise the output of " kanbosa , " a full and fruity red wine , " rather on the sweet side , " he said . it might not be the choice of an expert red wine lover but caters to local tastes , he said .
" we have to slowly introduce the locals to wine , " leiendecker said . two young women are sitting on stools and pasting labels on filled bottles .
" it 's all done manually here because we do n't have any expensive machinery to do the work , " leiendecker said . the vineyard employs about 60 people and primarily cultures shiraz and sauvignon grapes . pruning the vines takes place in october and harvesting is in april . investor interest despite poor soil and low yield bildunterschrift : the slopes above leiendecker 's hometown are very fertile in comparison to burma since the soil is poorer than in germany 's moselle region and because the vines do not receive much sunshine during the rainy season from april to october , the yield is rather small . " in germany , we may get between 10,000 and 12,000 liters of wine per hectare , but here it is only about 3,000 liters , " leiendecker said . morsbach has found a number of german investors for his vineyard project , but it was n't easy .
he still is often confronted with doubts about whether one should invest at all in a country under a repressive military regime . " we are n't here because of the military junta but despite of it , " he said . morsbach has fallen in love with the locals and insisted that sanctions and holding back investments would only play into the hands of the military and isolate the population .
leiendecker agreed .
he has enjoyed his stay in burma and intends to remain against all political odds , he said .
" it is pioneer work , and we literally have to build everything from scratch as there is no support from the military government , " he said . he is currently also overseeing construction of a row of bungalows to accommodate golfers and trekkers . the only thing that he sometimes misses is cheese , he said , which would go nicely with his wines . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the boersenverein , the german book publishers ' and book-sellers ' association , said kiefer was an internationally renowned artist " who confronts his time with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and the ephemeral . "
in his work , the 63-year-old artist also grappled with literature and poetry , a statement from the prize jury said .
the book and its form were the primary conveyor of expression for kiefer , the jury said .
the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding .
kiefer , 63 , who lives has lived in france since 1993 , is the first artist to be given the annual prize .
on friday , kiefer called peace " an unachievable utopia . "
" there is no such thing as final peace , " kiefer told reporters .
" peace is a utopia , something that can never be achieved .
it has to be created every day anew in our heads .
it is a struggle . "
kiefer 's anti-war art includes warplanes made of battered lead which are now exhibited in the louisiana museum , one of europe 's top contemporary art galleries , north of the danish capital copenhagen .
kiefer said friday he wrote a diary daily and had nearly become a writer instead of an artist .
the award ceremonies came as meanwhile the international frankfurt book fair was in its final day on sunday after a five-day run .

19 . art historian and publicist werner spies gave a speech honoring kiefer at the ceremony .
the boersenverein , the german book publishers ' and book-sellers ' association , said kiefer was an internationally renowned artist " who confronts his time with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and the ephemeral . "
in his work , the 63-year-old artist also grappled with literature and poetry , a statement from the prize jury said .
the book and its form were the primary conveyor of expression for kiefer , the jury said .
the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding .
kiefer , 63 , who lives has lived in france since 1993 , is the first artist to be given the annual prize .
on friday , kiefer called peace " an unachievable utopia . "
" there is no such thing as final peace , " kiefer told reporters .
" peace is a utopia , something that can never be achieved .
it has to be created every day anew in our heads .
it is a struggle . "
kiefer 's anti-war art includes warplanes made of battered lead which are now exhibited in the louisiana museum , one of europe 's top contemporary art galleries , north of the danish capital copenhagen .
kiefer said friday he wrote a diary daily and had nearly become a writer instead of an artist .
the award ceremonies came as meanwhile the international frankfurt book fair was in its final day on sunday after a five-day run .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .

" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .

in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .

" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .

18 that emergency global summits on the finance crisis will be held - the first taking place in the us before the end of november . the announcement was made at the us presidential retreat , camp david , outside washington , where european commission president jose manuel barroso also joined the meeting .
" i look forward to hosting this meeting in the near future , " said bush , who added that developed as well as emerging economies would be included .
" we 're dealing with a significant problem . "
bush and sarkozy , who was representing the 27-member european union as the current president , emphasized their continuing support for free market economies and opposition to protectionism and isolationism .
it is " essential we preserve the foundation of democratic capitalism , " bush said .
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
agreement on the summit was announced immediately after sarkozy and barroso arrived at camp david from an eu-canada summit in quebec city .
sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .
world leaders will also " seek agreement on principles of reform " needed to avoid another failure and " assure global prosperity in the future , " the three men said in the statement .
a global crisis needs a global voice , says sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso and sarkozy brought the eu 's vision to the us " first and foremost , this is a worldwide crisis and we must find a worldwide solution , " sarkozy said .
the goal of the emergency summit , sarkozy said , was to " speak with one and the same voice . "
" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .
un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "
" the sort of capitalism we have witnessed is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in , " he added .

sarkozy has said it is " necessary to rebuild the entire global financial and monetary system from the bottom up . "
in july 1944 , an agreement was signed in bretton woods , new hampshire , that established new rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states .
sarkozy said eu leaders planned to go to asia next week to discuss the crisis .
the goal of the summit is to discuss ideas about how to prevent the recurrence of the wave of financial failures that have forced governments to intervene hugely in capital markets and the banking system .
sarkozy and barroso also called for the building of a new financial order and new global capitalism system .
sarkozy denounced the failures in the us system that had led to the global crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2008 spanish couples prefer bad marriage over bad money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish couples are willing to ride out the financial crisis in loveless marriages people may marry for love , but divorce is about money , as spain 's deepening economic crisis is making clear .
this year 's slowdown and the credit crunch affecting banks are cutting divorce rates by as much as 30 percent . " it has become extremely difficult for couples wanting to divorce to sell their home at a reasonable price , and the crisis is also making it harder to maintain two separate households , " madrid divorce lawyer antonio prada told the dpa news agency .
as a result , couples which no longer have anything to say to each other stay under the same roof , developing what prada calls " new forms of living together . "
divorce rates went into a clear decline earlier this year , when the meltdown of spain 's key property sector and the international economic conjuncture put an abrupt end to more than a decade of uninterrupted growth .
growth has now plunged from 3.8 percent in 2007 to close to zero , and unemployment has soared past 10 per cent .
prices of used housing dropped by more than 10 per cent in the first nine months of this year , according to the property valuation company tinsa .
bailout plans could have an effect on marriages the government is now planning to inject up to 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 200 billion -rrb- into the financial system to shore up banks .
if the plan fails , the collapse of housing prices and the difficulties to obtain mortgages could discourage divorces further , analysts say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a couple 's differences may not be as serious as bankruptcy " couples which intended to divorce may even stay together permanently , " prada says .
" the economic crisis would thus help to preserve marriages " in cases where the partners have at least friendly relations , he explains .
couples which can not stand the sight of each other , however , are resorting to " internet divorces " based on standard contracts supplied by law firms charging low fees .
this is not necessarily leading to happier times for those involved though .
" contracts supplied over the internet always create problems , because they do not deal with the details of dividing property , child custody and other specifics in each individual case , " prada warns .
the number of divorces has increased steadily since spain legalized the procedure in 1981 , with more than 100,000 couples untying the knot annually .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government made divorce easier in 2005 .
however , prada says the reform did not increase divorces on a large scale , because its main novelty - the abolition of the concept of the guilty party - was already being applied in practice .
adult kids coming back to the familial home while the economic slump is turning estranged couples into reluctant flatmates , it is having a similar impact on parents and their adult children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grown-up children are moving back with their folks rising unemployment and difficulties in obtaining mortgages or credit to launch businesses is making increasing numbers of people aged more than 30 years stay with their parents or return to the family home if they have left .
the phenomenon became visible already in 2007 , when the number of people moving out of their parents ' homes increased only 2.8 percent , down from 5 per cent in previous years , said jose luis arroyo of the spanish youth council .
" in spain , portugal or italy , the family still plays an important role " compared to northern or central europe , which offer more social benefits to young people seeking to become independent from their parents , arroyo told the daily el pais . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it booked the largest number of visitors in its 60-year-history . with an attendance of 78,218 on saturday alone , the fair easily exceeded all previous attendance figures , in a year that saw turkey feature as the show 's guest of honor . closing the show on sunday were readings by bestselling irish author cecilia ahern - daughter of former irish prime minister bertie ahern - and berlin cult-writer martina brandl . the fair is a vital part of the world publishing industry , as the fair is the world 's principal meeting place for world book publishing and a marketplace for book rights . the participation of turkey as this year 's guest of honor at the fair has underlined the country 's controversial balance between traditionalism and free speech . amnesty : book fair will help rights in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt welcomed nobel prize winner orhan pamuk to the fair global rights organization amnesty international said on sunday that turkey 's status as guest nation at the fair will have a positive effect on freedom of expression in the country . " it does n't change the situation in turkey yet , of course , but it is a step on the path towards breaking taboos , " amnesty 's turkey expert amke dietert told german news agency dpa .
" as long as there are serious restrictions in turkey , we ca n't talk about freedom of expression . " fair spokesman thomas minkus said the success of turkey 's participation was also reflected in the sales figures , and that " literature from turkey is a literature that has established itself in germany . " the financial crisis had also not affected the license and rights trading at the fair , which was up 8 percent from 2007 , said minkus . anselm kiefer , a german sculptor , was awarded the german book trade peace prize in frankfurt 's st paul 's church on sunday . art historian and publicist werner spies gave a speech honoring kiefer at the ceremony . the boersenverein , the german book publishers ' and book-sellers ' association , said kiefer was an internationally renowned artist " who confronts his time with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and the ephemeral . " the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding . china guest in 2009 also attending the fair at the weekend were nobel literature prize winner guenter grass , german prize-winning author siegfried lenz , turkish nobel-winner orhan pamuk and the brazilian best-seller paulo coelho . the 2009 guest of honor at the fair will be china , when , according to frankfurt book fair director juergen boos , the global publishing industry will " have the opportunity to make business contacts with the booming economic nation to a new degree . " " china will present its modern literature and culture to a world public , reflecting this dynamic process now under way in the country , " said boos . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2008 global financial crisis cages the celtic tiger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is n't so bright for these sons of the previously powerful celtic tiger the choked voices on the airwaves telling tales of job losses , repossessions , debt and downright misery signal the seismic shift in ireland 's economy that has caught thousands unaware . one such voice is that of kathleen , a mother of four , who sobs as she describes how she was given a sub-prime mortgage to redecorate the family home she inherited .
with arrears of 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9413.6 -rrb- , she is now in danger of losing that home as interest rate increases meant that her repayments jumped from 1,600 to 2,300 euros a month .
" i just could n't afford it any more , " she said .
with her husband 's income dwindling as he was dependent on the ailing construction sector and the mortgage company threatening " to go legal " she could see no way out and was feeling suicidal .
the couple 's combined earnings of 3,000 euros a month meant that she should only have been allowed about 90,000 euros in a mortgage instead of the 260,000 which a sub-prime lender , owned by failed us investment bank , lehman , loaned the family .
" i can see no way out .
i just want to get back to the way i was .
i just want to be happy for my children , " said the woman , who would only use her first name when she spoke to irish national broadcaster rte last week .
celtic tiger boom a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do you know ' brother can you spare a dime ' ? "
such stories are a far cry from the heady swagger of the days of the celtic tiger boom , and ireland is shocked at the speed of the crash .
" people are dropping like flies from the construction and engineering sector , " says fergus mcgabhann , an engineer in his 40s who has just received notice that he is losing his job in one month 's time .
" it 's all changed , " says mcgabhann , who has also lost money in a government-promoted savings scheme , the value of which has plummeted .
" this means that the reserves i had are depleted and i do n't have time to sit and wait it out .
i ca n't really afford to stay here now , " he told the dpa news agency .
his daily commute to ringaskiddy , which is home to the pharmaceutical industry near cork in south-west ireland , has changed beyond recognition .
" the traffic jams are all gone , " he says .
" the car parks are empty .
we have had troughs before , but you would find small jobs to keep you going .
this time all the big projects have been cancelled and small jobs have all dried up too . "
he feels as if he is left with no choice but to leave .
" i have done it before , but this is the first time i have to do it with small children and i am not looking forward to it , " he said .
unemployment rising sharply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry has been hit with jobs lost the combined effects of the global credit crisis and the construction slump have meant that unemployment in ireland has increased by 49 per cent in the last year and is expected to hit 7.3 per cent next year .
according to the september figures from the central statistics office , the numbers receiving unemployment benefit have risen to 244,500 , a massive 48-per-cent rise on september 2007 and the highest in 11 years .
those who are in employment feel they can do little to secure themselves against what may be worse times to come .
jackie gowran , who is self-employed , had hoped to downsize from a four-bedroomed house to a three-bedroomed one , but the housing market downturn has meant that her house has remained unsold after a year .
" the credit crunch does restrict your options .
it was n't crucial for me to sell , but the reality is i wanted to downsize and i have n't been able to , " she said .
" in terms of being self-employed , it would make you sit up and take notice .
i have enough work lined up for the next six months , but after that it might be different . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with arrears of 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9413.6 -rrb- , she is now in danger of losing that home as interest rate increases meant that her repayments jumped from 1,600 to 2,300 euros a month .
" i just could n't afford it any more , " she said .
with her husband 's income dwindling as he was dependent on the ailing construction sector and the mortgage company threatening " to go legal " she could see no way out and was feeling suicidal .
the couple 's combined earnings of 3,000 euros a month meant that she should only have been allowed about 90,000 euros in a mortgage instead of the 260,000 which a sub-prime lender , owned by failed us investment bank , lehman , loaned the family .
" i can see no way out .
i just want to get back to the way i was .
i just want to be happy for my children , " said the woman , who would only use her first name when she spoke to irish national broadcaster rte last week .
celtic tiger boom a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do you know ' brother can you spare a dime ' ? "
such stories are a far cry from the heady swagger of the days of the celtic tiger boom , and ireland is shocked at the speed of the crash .
" people are dropping like flies from the construction and engineering sector , " says fergus mcgabhann , an engineer in his 40s who has just received notice that he is losing his job in one month 's time .
" it 's all changed , " says mcgabhann , who has also lost money in a government-promoted savings scheme , the value of which has plummeted .
" this means that the reserves i had are depleted and i do n't have time to sit and wait it out .
i ca n't really afford to stay here now , " he told the dpa news agency .
his daily commute to ringaskiddy , which is home to the pharmaceutical industry near cork in south-west ireland , has changed beyond recognition .
" the traffic jams are all gone , " he says .
" the car parks are empty .
we have had troughs before , but you would find small jobs to keep you going .
this time all the big projects have been cancelled and small jobs have all dried up too . "
he feels as if he is left with no choice but to leave .
" i have done it before , but this is the first time i have to do it with small children and i am not looking forward to it , " he said .
unemployment rising sharply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry has been hit with jobs lost the combined effects of the global credit crisis and the construction slump have meant that unemployment in ireland has increased by 49 per cent in the last year and is expected to hit 7.3 per cent next year .
according to the september figures from the central statistics office , the numbers receiving unemployment benefit have risen to 244,500 , a massive 48-per-cent rise on september 2007 and the highest in 11 years .
those who are in employment feel they can do little to secure themselves against what may be worse times to come .
jackie gowran , who is self-employed , had hoped to downsize from a four-bedroomed house to a three-bedroomed one , but the housing market downturn has meant that her house has remained unsold after a year .
" the credit crunch does restrict your options .
it was n't crucial for me to sell , but the reality is i wanted to downsize and i have n't been able to , " she said .
" in terms of being self-employed , it would make you sit up and take notice .
i have enough work lined up for the next six months , but after that it might be different . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2008 us , eu leaders announce global finance crisis summits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush offered to host the first planned global summit in the us in november us president george w bush and french president nicolas sarkozy said saturday , oct .
18 that emergency global summits on the finance crisis will be held - the first taking place in the us before the end of november . the announcement was made at the us presidential retreat , camp david , outside washington , where european commission president jose manuel barroso also joined the meeting .
" i look forward to hosting this meeting in the near future , " said bush , who added that developed as well as emerging economies would be included .
" we 're dealing with a significant problem . "
bush and sarkozy , who was representing the 27-member european union as the current president , emphasized their continuing support for free market economies and opposition to protectionism and isolationism .
it is " essential we preserve the foundation of democratic capitalism , " bush said .
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
agreement on the summit was announced immediately after sarkozy and barroso arrived at camp david from an eu-canada summit in quebec city .
sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .
world leaders will also " seek agreement on principles of reform " needed to avoid another failure and " assure global prosperity in the future , " the three men said in the statement .
a global crisis needs a global voice , says sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso and sarkozy brought the eu 's vision to the us " first and foremost , this is a worldwide crisis and we must find a worldwide solution , " sarkozy said .
the goal of the emergency summit , sarkozy said , was to " speak with one and the same voice . "
" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .
un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "
" the sort of capitalism we have witnessed is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in , " he added .
calls for a new " bretton woods " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown aim to rebuild the global finance system both sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown have called for the summit to be a " new bretton woods . "
sarkozy has said it is " necessary to rebuild the entire global financial and monetary system from the bottom up . "
in july 1944 , an agreement was signed in bretton woods , new hampshire , that established new rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states .
sarkozy said eu leaders planned to go to asia next week to discuss the crisis .
the goal of the summit is to discuss ideas about how to prevent the recurrence of the wave of financial failures that have forced governments to intervene hugely in capital markets and the banking system .
sarkozy and barroso also called for the building of a new financial order and new global capitalism system .
sarkozy denounced the failures in the us system that had led to the global crisis .
series of emergency meetings to begin in november the expanded idea of a series of meetings was put forth in a statement issued after the men finished meeting .
the g20 finance ministers are planning to meet from november 7-9 in brazil , but it was not clear if that meeting would be connected to the emergency finance summit .
the g20 includes the g8 most industrialized countries -lrb- us , canada , italy , germany , britain , france , japan , russia -rrb- and argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , and the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french demonstrators unfurled a banner proclaiming " bridges , not walls " at the paris rally .
other signs that read : " we are all immigrant children " and " detention centers are lawless places , a state secret . "
in le mans , central france , a 60-year-old woman doused herself in flammable liquid in front of a detention centre and set herself on fire in protest at authorities ' threats to deport her partner back to armenia .
the paris rally along with a ' citizens summit ' was organized by some 300 international ngos , many of them from african nations .
its organizers adopted a declaration friday evening expressing their dismay at a policy " which would turn europe into a fortress . "
new eu immigration pact prompts demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu agreed sweeping measures which tighten laws adopted thursday by leaders of the 27-member european union , the european pact on immigration and asylum - a document of political intent but not binding laws - sets out principles for managing migration , fighting illegal immigration and forming partnerships with countries people leave or travel through to get to europe .
it also seeks to make border controls more effective while building better asylum policy , with refugees increasingly obliged to apply for asylum status from outside the bloc .
britain 's new immigration minister has already promised to impose tougher restrictions as the country 's unemployment rate looks set to soar to its highest level in nearly a decade .
" it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " phil woolas told the times newspaper in an interview published saturday .
in a dramatic change of policy , the labour government intends to place a limit on immigration , according to the daily .
" there has to be a balance between the number of people coming in and the number of people leaving , " said woolas .
the minister said his government would not allow britain 's population to grow to 70 million people .
britain 's population grew by about 3.4 percent to almost 61 million people between 2001 and 2007 fuelled by expansion of the european union , according to latest figures from the office for national statistics .
britain 's unemployment rate jumped to an eight-year high of 5.7 percent in the three months to august , official data showed on wednesday .
the 5.7-percent unemployment rate was the highest since the three months to march , 2000 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with arrears of 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9413.6 -rrb- , she is now in danger of losing that home as interest rate increases meant that her repayments jumped from 1,600 to 2,300 euros a month .
" i just could n't afford it any more , " she said .
with her husband 's income dwindling as he was dependent on the ailing construction sector and the mortgage company threatening " to go legal " she could see no way out and was feeling suicidal .
the couple 's combined earnings of 3,000 euros a month meant that she should only have been allowed about 90,000 euros in a mortgage instead of the 260,000 which a sub-prime lender , owned by failed us investment bank , lehman , loaned the family .
" i can see no way out .
i just want to get back to the way i was .
i just want to be happy for my children , " said the woman , who would only use her first name when she spoke to irish national broadcaster rte last week .

such stories are a far cry from the heady swagger of the days of the celtic tiger boom , and ireland is shocked at the speed of the crash .
" people are dropping like flies from the construction and engineering sector , " says fergus mcgabhann , an engineer in his 40s who has just received notice that he is losing his job in one month 's time .
" it 's all changed , " says mcgabhann , who has also lost money in a government-promoted savings scheme , the value of which has plummeted .
" this means that the reserves i had are depleted and i do n't have time to sit and wait it out .
i ca n't really afford to stay here now , " he told the dpa news agency .
his daily commute to ringaskiddy , which is home to the pharmaceutical industry near cork in south-west ireland , has changed beyond recognition .
" the traffic jams are all gone , " he says .
" the car parks are empty .
we have had troughs before , but you would find small jobs to keep you going .
this time all the big projects have been cancelled and small jobs have all dried up too . "
he feels as if he is left with no choice but to leave .
" i have done it before , but this is the first time i have to do it with small children and i am not looking forward to it , " he said .
unemployment rising sharply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry has been hit with jobs lost the combined effects of the global credit crisis and the construction slump have meant that unemployment in ireland has increased by 49 per cent in the last year and is expected to hit 7.3 per cent next year .
according to the september figures from the central statistics office , the numbers receiving unemployment benefit have risen to 244,500 , a massive 48-per-cent rise on september 2007 and the highest in 11 years .
those who are in employment feel they can do little to secure themselves against what may be worse times to come .
jackie gowran , who is self-employed , had hoped to downsize from a four-bedroomed house to a three-bedroomed one , but the housing market downturn has meant that her house has remained unsold after a year .
" the credit crunch does restrict your options .
it was n't crucial for me to sell , but the reality is i wanted to downsize and i have n't been able to , " she said .
" in terms of being self-employed , it would make you sit up and take notice .

only when buddhist monks approcah does he remember that he 's not in his hometonw in the moselle but in burma . aythaya vineyards is the brainchild of bert morsbach , who relocated from thailand years ago , where he manufactured surf boards . almost 10 years ago , he leased a plot of land at an elevation of 1,300 meters near inle lake , about an hour 's flight time north-east of burma 's main port city of yangon . morsbach then experimented a few years with vines imported from germany and consulted numerous wine experts .
eventually , his efforts bore fruit and he went into serious production . about two years ago , he hired leiendecker , 50 , a well-known vintner from the moselle town of bernkastel in western germany , who has won prizes for the excellence of his vintages . now he produces in burma .
about 100,000 bottles of sauvignon blanc are made there every year , and the 2007 vintage is already being touted as a breakthrough success . " the quality is comparable to similar vintages from europe , chile and australia , " leiendecker said . many five-star hotels in the country are carrying the vintage on their wine lists , but it is also served in the restaurant that is part of the vineyard and where leiendecker lives . the terrace with a view of the plantation is currently being expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors . " we need more space to host weddings and company outings , " leiendecker said . more chairs are needed , and more china . " chinese weddings require a lot of small bowls and at least one waiter for every three tables , but at burmese weddings , one waiter is usually enough to tend to up to seven tables , " leiendecker said .
" just three years ago , i would never have dreamed that i once would have to distinguish between chinese and burmese weddings , " he added . wine market focused locally the vineyard has to focus its marketing locally because burma 's tourism industry is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monk-led demos brought unwanted publicity last year 's brutal suppression by the ruling military junta of monk-led protests and the subsequent devastation left behind by cyclone nargis in may have resulted in dwindling tourist numbers . " many people are under the impression that the entire country was devastated by the cyclone , which is , of course , not the case , " leiendecker explained . while the cyclone rampaged through the irrawaddy river delta and the coastline in burma 's south , the rest of the country escaped unharmed . aythaya vineyards is located near inle lake , which , with its stilted bungalow resorts , hotels and rustic villages , used to attract thousands of foreign tourists each year . nowadays , many of the hotels are either closed or deserted . leiendecker has recently begun to raise the output of " kanbosa , " a full and fruity red wine , " rather on the sweet side , " he said . it might not be the choice of an expert red wine lover but caters to local tastes , he said .
" we have to slowly introduce the locals to wine , " leiendecker said . two young women are sitting on stools and pasting labels on filled bottles .
" it 's all done manually here because we do n't have any expensive machinery to do the work , " leiendecker said . the vineyard employs about 60 people and primarily cultures shiraz and sauvignon grapes . pruning the vines takes place in october and harvesting is in april . investor interest despite poor soil and low yield bildunterschrift : the slopes above leiendecker 's hometown are very fertile in comparison to burma since the soil is poorer than in germany 's moselle region and because the vines do not receive much sunshine during the rainy season from april to october , the yield is rather small . " in germany , we may get between 10,000 and 12,000 liters of wine per hectare , but here it is only about 3,000 liters , " leiendecker said . morsbach has found a number of german investors for his vineyard project , but it was n't easy .
he still is often confronted with doubts about whether one should invest at all in a country under a repressive military regime . " we are n't here because of the military junta but despite of it , " he said . morsbach has fallen in love with the locals and insisted that sanctions and holding back investments would only play into the hands of the military and isolate the population .
leiendecker agreed .
he has enjoyed his stay in burma and intends to remain against all political odds , he said .
" it is pioneer work , and we literally have to build everything from scratch as there is no support from the military government , " he said . he is currently also overseeing construction of a row of bungalows to accommodate golfers and trekkers . the only thing that he sometimes misses is cheese , he said , which would go nicely with his wines . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only when buddhist monks approcah does he remember that he 's not in his hometonw in the moselle but in burma . aythaya vineyards is the brainchild of bert morsbach , who relocated from thailand years ago , where he manufactured surf boards . almost 10 years ago , he leased a plot of land at an elevation of 1,300 meters near inle lake , about an hour 's flight time north-east of burma 's main port city of yangon . morsbach then experimented a few years with vines imported from germany and consulted numerous wine experts .
eventually , his efforts bore fruit and he went into serious production . about two years ago , he hired leiendecker , 50 , a well-known vintner from the moselle town of bernkastel in western germany , who has won prizes for the excellence of his vintages . now he produces in burma .
about 100,000 bottles of sauvignon blanc are made there every year , and the 2007 vintage is already being touted as a breakthrough success . " the quality is comparable to similar vintages from europe , chile and australia , " leiendecker said . many five-star hotels in the country are carrying the vintage on their wine lists , but it is also served in the restaurant that is part of the vineyard and where leiendecker lives . the terrace with a view of the plantation is currently being expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors . " we need more space to host weddings and company outings , " leiendecker said . more chairs are needed , and more china . " chinese weddings require a lot of small bowls and at least one waiter for every three tables , but at burmese weddings , one waiter is usually enough to tend to up to seven tables , " leiendecker said .
" just three years ago , i would never have dreamed that i once would have to distinguish between chinese and burmese weddings , " he added . wine market focused locally the vineyard has to focus its marketing locally because burma 's tourism industry is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monk-led demos brought unwanted publicity last year 's brutal suppression by the ruling military junta of monk-led protests and the subsequent devastation left behind by cyclone nargis in may have resulted in dwindling tourist numbers . " many people are under the impression that the entire country was devastated by the cyclone , which is , of course , not the case , " leiendecker explained . while the cyclone rampaged through the irrawaddy river delta and the coastline in burma 's south , the rest of the country escaped unharmed . aythaya vineyards is located near inle lake , which , with its stilted bungalow resorts , hotels and rustic villages , used to attract thousands of foreign tourists each year . nowadays , many of the hotels are either closed or deserted . leiendecker has recently begun to raise the output of " kanbosa , " a full and fruity red wine , " rather on the sweet side , " he said . it might not be the choice of an expert red wine lover but caters to local tastes , he said .
" we have to slowly introduce the locals to wine , " leiendecker said . two young women are sitting on stools and pasting labels on filled bottles .
" it 's all done manually here because we do n't have any expensive machinery to do the work , " leiendecker said . the vineyard employs about 60 people and primarily cultures shiraz and sauvignon grapes . pruning the vines takes place in october and harvesting is in april . investor interest despite poor soil and low yield bildunterschrift : the slopes above leiendecker 's hometown are very fertile in comparison to burma since the soil is poorer than in germany 's moselle region and because the vines do not receive much sunshine during the rainy season from april to october , the yield is rather small . " in germany , we may get between 10,000 and 12,000 liters of wine per hectare , but here it is only about 3,000 liters , " leiendecker said . morsbach has found a number of german investors for his vineyard project , but it was n't easy .
he still is often confronted with doubts about whether one should invest at all in a country under a repressive military regime . " we are n't here because of the military junta but despite of it , " he said . morsbach has fallen in love with the locals and insisted that sanctions and holding back investments would only play into the hands of the military and isolate the population .
leiendecker agreed .
he has enjoyed his stay in burma and intends to remain against all political odds , he said .
" it is pioneer work , and we literally have to build everything from scratch as there is no support from the military government , " he said . he is currently also overseeing construction of a row of bungalows to accommodate golfers and trekkers . the only thing that he sometimes misses is cheese , he said , which would go nicely with his wines . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" just three years ago , i would never have dreamed that i once would have to distinguish between chinese and burmese weddings , " he added . wine market focused locally the vineyard has to focus its marketing locally because burma 's tourism industry is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monk-led demos brought unwanted publicity last year 's brutal suppression by the ruling military junta of monk-led protests and the subsequent devastation left behind by cyclone nargis in may have resulted in dwindling tourist numbers . " many people are under the impression that the entire country was devastated by the cyclone , which is , of course , not the case , " leiendecker explained . while the cyclone rampaged through the irrawaddy river delta and the coastline in burma 's south , the rest of the country escaped unharmed . aythaya vineyards is located near inle lake , which , with its stilted bungalow resorts , hotels and rustic villages , used to attract thousands of foreign tourists each year . nowadays , many of the hotels are either closed or deserted . leiendecker has recently begun to raise the output of " kanbosa , " a full and fruity red wine , " rather on the sweet side , " he said . it might not be the choice of an expert red wine lover but caters to local tastes , he said .
" we have to slowly introduce the locals to wine , " leiendecker said . two young women are sitting on stools and pasting labels on filled bottles .
" it 's all done manually here because we do n't have any expensive machinery to do the work , " leiendecker said . the vineyard employs about 60 people and primarily cultures shiraz and sauvignon grapes . pruning the vines takes place in october and harvesting is in april . investor interest despite poor soil and low yield bildunterschrift : the slopes above leiendecker 's hometown are very fertile in comparison to burma since the soil is poorer than in germany 's moselle region and because the vines do not receive much sunshine during the rainy season from april to october , the yield is rather small . " in germany , we may get between 10,000 and 12,000 liters of wine per hectare , but here it is only about 3,000 liters , " leiendecker said . morsbach has found a number of german investors for his vineyard project , but it was n't easy .
he still is often confronted with doubts about whether one should invest at all in a country under a repressive military regime . " we are n't here because of the military junta but despite of it , " he said . morsbach has fallen in love with the locals and insisted that sanctions and holding back investments would only play into the hands of the military and isolate the population .
leiendecker agreed .
he has enjoyed his stay in burma and intends to remain against all political odds , he said .
" it is pioneer work , and we literally have to build everything from scratch as there is no support from the military government , " he said . he is currently also overseeing construction of a row of bungalows to accommodate golfers and trekkers . the only thing that he sometimes misses is cheese , he said , which would go nicely with his wines . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 . art historian and publicist werner spies gave a speech honoring kiefer at the ceremony .
the boersenverein , the german book publishers ' and book-sellers ' association , said kiefer was an internationally renowned artist " who confronts his time with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and the ephemeral . "
in his work , the 63-year-old artist also grappled with literature and poetry , a statement from the prize jury said .
the book and its form were the primary conveyor of expression for kiefer , the jury said .
the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding .
kiefer , 63 , who lives has lived in france since 1993 , is the first artist to be given the annual prize .
on friday , kiefer called peace " an unachievable utopia . "
" there is no such thing as final peace , " kiefer told reporters .
" peace is a utopia , something that can never be achieved .
it has to be created every day anew in our heads .
it is a struggle . "
kiefer 's anti-war art includes warplanes made of battered lead which are now exhibited in the louisiana museum , one of europe 's top contemporary art galleries , north of the danish capital copenhagen .
kiefer said friday he wrote a diary daily and had nearly become a writer instead of an artist .
the award ceremonies came as meanwhile the international frankfurt book fair was in its final day on sunday after a five-day run .

" i look forward to hosting this meeting in the near future , " said bush , who added that developed as well as emerging economies would be included .
" we 're dealing with a significant problem . "
bush and sarkozy , who was representing the 27-member european union as the current president , emphasized their continuing support for free market economies and opposition to protectionism and isolationism .
it is " essential we preserve the foundation of democratic capitalism , " bush said .
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
agreement on the summit was announced immediately after sarkozy and barroso arrived at camp david from an eu-canada summit in quebec city .
sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .
world leaders will also " seek agreement on principles of reform " needed to avoid another failure and " assure global prosperity in the future , " the three men said in the statement .
a global crisis needs a global voice , says sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso and sarkozy brought the eu 's vision to the us " first and foremost , this is a worldwide crisis and we must find a worldwide solution , " sarkozy said .
the goal of the emergency summit , sarkozy said , was to " speak with one and the same voice . "
" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .
un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2008 spanish couples prefer bad marriage over bad money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish couples are willing to ride out the financial crisis in loveless marriages people may marry for love , but divorce is about money , as spain 's deepening economic crisis is making clear .
this year 's slowdown and the credit crunch affecting banks are cutting divorce rates by as much as 30 percent . " it has become extremely difficult for couples wanting to divorce to sell their home at a reasonable price , and the crisis is also making it harder to maintain two separate households , " madrid divorce lawyer antonio prada told the dpa news agency .
as a result , couples which no longer have anything to say to each other stay under the same roof , developing what prada calls " new forms of living together . "
divorce rates went into a clear decline earlier this year , when the meltdown of spain 's key property sector and the international economic conjuncture put an abrupt end to more than a decade of uninterrupted growth .
growth has now plunged from 3.8 percent in 2007 to close to zero , and unemployment has soared past 10 per cent .
prices of used housing dropped by more than 10 per cent in the first nine months of this year , according to the property valuation company tinsa .
bailout plans could have an effect on marriages the government is now planning to inject up to 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 200 billion -rrb- into the financial system to shore up banks .
if the plan fails , the collapse of housing prices and the difficulties to obtain mortgages could discourage divorces further , analysts say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a couple 's differences may not be as serious as bankruptcy " couples which intended to divorce may even stay together permanently , " prada says .
" the economic crisis would thus help to preserve marriages " in cases where the partners have at least friendly relations , he explains .
couples which can not stand the sight of each other , however , are resorting to " internet divorces " based on standard contracts supplied by law firms charging low fees .
this is not necessarily leading to happier times for those involved though .
" contracts supplied over the internet always create problems , because they do not deal with the details of dividing property , child custody and other specifics in each individual case , " prada warns .
the number of divorces has increased steadily since spain legalized the procedure in 1981 , with more than 100,000 couples untying the knot annually .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government made divorce easier in 2005 .
however , prada says the reform did not increase divorces on a large scale , because its main novelty - the abolition of the concept of the guilty party - was already being applied in practice .
adult kids coming back to the familial home while the economic slump is turning estranged couples into reluctant flatmates , it is having a similar impact on parents and their adult children .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grown-up children are moving back with their folks rising unemployment and difficulties in obtaining mortgages or credit to launch businesses is making increasing numbers of people aged more than 30 years stay with their parents or return to the family home if they have left .
the phenomenon became visible already in 2007 , when the number of people moving out of their parents ' homes increased only 2.8 percent , down from 5 per cent in previous years , said jose luis arroyo of the spanish youth council .
" in spain , portugal or italy , the family still plays an important role " compared to northern or central europe , which offer more social benefits to young people seeking to become independent from their parents , arroyo told the daily el pais . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de after divorce trend , more german couples stay married divorce is down ever so slightly , reflecting a trend over the last few years .
couples also stay together longer before severing the knot .
-lrb- 29.08.2008 -rrb- divorce law may lead to divided , two-speed eu for the first time ever , nine of the eu 's 27 members are preparing to implement a cooperation mechanism that some observers fear could turn the bloc into a collection of ad-hoc agreements made by small groups of states .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .

18 that emergency global summits on the finance crisis will be held - the first taking place in the us before the end of november . the announcement was made at the us presidential retreat , camp david , outside washington , where european commission president jose manuel barroso also joined the meeting .
" i look forward to hosting this meeting in the near future , " said bush , who added that developed as well as emerging economies would be included .
" we 're dealing with a significant problem . "
bush and sarkozy , who was representing the 27-member european union as the current president , emphasized their continuing support for free market economies and opposition to protectionism and isolationism .
it is " essential we preserve the foundation of democratic capitalism , " bush said .
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
agreement on the summit was announced immediately after sarkozy and barroso arrived at camp david from an eu-canada summit in quebec city .
sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .
world leaders will also " seek agreement on principles of reform " needed to avoid another failure and " assure global prosperity in the future , " the three men said in the statement .
a global crisis needs a global voice , says sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso and sarkozy brought the eu 's vision to the us " first and foremost , this is a worldwide crisis and we must find a worldwide solution , " sarkozy said .
the goal of the emergency summit , sarkozy said , was to " speak with one and the same voice . "
" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .
un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "
" the sort of capitalism we have witnessed is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in , " he added .
calls for a new " bretton woods " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown aim to rebuild the global finance system both sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown have called for the summit to be a " new bretton woods . "
sarkozy has said it is " necessary to rebuild the entire global financial and monetary system from the bottom up . "
in july 1944 , an agreement was signed in bretton woods , new hampshire , that established new rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states .
sarkozy said eu leaders planned to go to asia next week to discuss the crisis .
the goal of the summit is to discuss ideas about how to prevent the recurrence of the wave of financial failures that have forced governments to intervene hugely in capital markets and the banking system .
sarkozy and barroso also called for the building of a new financial order and new global capitalism system .
sarkozy denounced the failures in the us system that had led to the global crisis .
series of emergency meetings to begin in november the expanded idea of a series of meetings was put forth in a statement issued after the men finished meeting .
the g20 finance ministers are planning to meet from november 7-9 in brazil , but it was not clear if that meeting would be connected to the emergency finance summit .
the g20 includes the g8 most industrialized countries -lrb- us , canada , italy , germany , britain , france , japan , russia -rrb- and argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , and the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new eu immigration pact prompts demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu agreed sweeping measures which tighten laws adopted thursday by leaders of the 27-member european union , the european pact on immigration and asylum - a document of political intent but not binding laws - sets out principles for managing migration , fighting illegal immigration and forming partnerships with countries people leave or travel through to get to europe .
it also seeks to make border controls more effective while building better asylum policy , with refugees increasingly obliged to apply for asylum status from outside the bloc .
britain 's new immigration minister has already promised to impose tougher restrictions as the country 's unemployment rate looks set to soar to its highest level in nearly a decade .
" it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " phil woolas told the times newspaper in an interview published saturday .
in a dramatic change of policy , the labour government intends to place a limit on immigration , according to the daily .
" there has to be a balance between the number of people coming in and the number of people leaving , " said woolas .
the minister said his government would not allow britain 's population to grow to 70 million people .
britain 's population grew by about 3.4 percent to almost 61 million people between 2001 and 2007 fuelled by expansion of the european union , according to latest figures from the office for national statistics .
britain 's unemployment rate jumped to an eight-year high of 5.7 percent in the three months to august , official data showed on wednesday .

only when buddhist monks approcah does he remember that he 's not in his hometonw in the moselle but in burma . aythaya vineyards is the brainchild of bert morsbach , who relocated from thailand years ago , where he manufactured surf boards . almost 10 years ago , he leased a plot of land at an elevation of 1,300 meters near inle lake , about an hour 's flight time north-east of burma 's main port city of yangon . morsbach then experimented a few years with vines imported from germany and consulted numerous wine experts .
eventually , his efforts bore fruit and he went into serious production . about two years ago , he hired leiendecker , 50 , a well-known vintner from the moselle town of bernkastel in western germany , who has won prizes for the excellence of his vintages . now he produces in burma .
about 100,000 bottles of sauvignon blanc are made there every year , and the 2007 vintage is already being touted as a breakthrough success . " the quality is comparable to similar vintages from europe , chile and australia , " leiendecker said . many five-star hotels in the country are carrying the vintage on their wine lists , but it is also served in the restaurant that is part of the vineyard and where leiendecker lives . the terrace with a view of the plantation is currently being expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .
tadic looking for un approval before agreeing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic opposes to eulex but un approval could change that serbian president boris tadic said earlier this week that the agreement over eulex deployment between belgrade and the eu was possible , but insisted it could be reached only by obtaining a green light from the un security council for the mission .
de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .
tadic looking for un approval before agreeing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic opposes to eulex but un approval could change that serbian president boris tadic said earlier this week that the agreement over eulex deployment between belgrade and the eu was possible , but insisted it could be reached only by obtaining a green light from the un security council for the mission .
de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .
tadic looking for un approval before agreeing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic opposes to eulex but un approval could change that serbian president boris tadic said earlier this week that the agreement over eulex deployment between belgrade and the eu was possible , but insisted it could be reached only by obtaining a green light from the un security council for the mission .
de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding .
kiefer , 63 , who lives has lived in france since 1993 , is the first artist to be given the annual prize .
on friday , kiefer called peace " an unachievable utopia . "
" there is no such thing as final peace , " kiefer told reporters .
" peace is a utopia , something that can never be achieved .
it has to be created every day anew in our heads .
it is a struggle . "
kiefer 's anti-war art includes warplanes made of battered lead which are now exhibited in the louisiana museum , one of europe 's top contemporary art galleries , north of the danish capital copenhagen .
kiefer said friday he wrote a diary daily and had nearly become a writer instead of an artist .
the award ceremonies came as meanwhile the international frankfurt book fair was in its final day on sunday after a five-day run .

it booked the largest number of visitors in its 60-year-history . with an attendance of 78,218 on saturday alone , the fair easily exceeded all previous attendance figures , in a year that saw turkey feature as the show 's guest of honor . closing the show on sunday were readings by bestselling irish author cecilia ahern - daughter of former irish prime minister bertie ahern - and berlin cult-writer martina brandl . the fair is a vital part of the world publishing industry , as the fair is the world 's principal meeting place for world book publishing and a marketplace for book rights . the participation of turkey as this year 's guest of honor at the fair has underlined the country 's controversial balance between traditionalism and free speech . amnesty : book fair will help rights in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt welcomed nobel prize winner orhan pamuk to the fair global rights organization amnesty international said on sunday that turkey 's status as guest nation at the fair will have a positive effect on freedom of expression in the country .

" as long as there are serious restrictions in turkey , we ca n't talk about freedom of expression . " fair spokesman thomas minkus said the success of turkey 's participation was also reflected in the sales figures , and that " literature from turkey is a literature that has established itself in germany . " the financial crisis had also not affected the license and rights trading at the fair , which was up 8 percent from 2007 , said minkus . anselm kiefer , a german sculptor , was awarded the german book trade peace prize in frankfurt 's st paul 's church on sunday . art historian and publicist werner spies gave a speech honoring kiefer at the ceremony . the boersenverein , the german book publishers ' and book-sellers ' association , said kiefer was an internationally renowned artist " who confronts his time with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and the ephemeral . " the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding . china guest in 2009 also attending the fair at the weekend were nobel literature prize winner guenter grass , german prize-winning author siegfried lenz , turkish nobel-winner orhan pamuk and the brazilian best-seller paulo coelho . the 2009 guest of honor at the fair will be china , when , according to frankfurt book fair director juergen boos , the global publishing industry will " have the opportunity to make business contacts with the booming economic nation to a new degree .

kiefer , 63 , who lives has lived in france since 1993 , is the first artist to be given the annual prize .

" there is no such thing as final peace , " kiefer told reporters .
" peace is a utopia , something that can never be achieved .
it has to be created every day anew in our heads .
it is a struggle . "
kiefer 's anti-war art includes warplanes made of battered lead which are now exhibited in the louisiana museum , one of europe 's top contemporary art galleries , north of the danish capital copenhagen .
kiefer said friday he wrote a diary daily and had nearly become a writer instead of an artist .

19 . art historian and publicist werner spies gave a speech honoring kiefer at the ceremony .
the boersenverein , the german book publishers ' and book-sellers ' association , said kiefer was an internationally renowned artist " who confronts his time with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and the ephemeral . "
in his work , the 63-year-old artist also grappled with literature and poetry , a statement from the prize jury said .
the book and its form were the primary conveyor of expression for kiefer , the jury said .
the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding .
kiefer , 63 , who lives has lived in france since 1993 , is the first artist to be given the annual prize .
on friday , kiefer called peace " an unachievable utopia . "
" there is no such thing as final peace , " kiefer told reporters .
" peace is a utopia , something that can never be achieved .
it has to be created every day anew in our heads .
it is a struggle . "
kiefer 's anti-war art includes warplanes made of battered lead which are now exhibited in the louisiana museum , one of europe 's top contemporary art galleries , north of the danish capital copenhagen .
kiefer said friday he wrote a diary daily and had nearly become a writer instead of an artist .
the award ceremonies came as meanwhile the international frankfurt book fair was in its final day on sunday after a five-day run .
this year 's fair featured 7,373 exhibitors , with turkey as this year 's special guest of honor . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .

18 that emergency global summits on the finance crisis will be held - the first taking place in the us before the end of november . the announcement was made at the us presidential retreat , camp david , outside washington , where european commission president jose manuel barroso also joined the meeting .
" i look forward to hosting this meeting in the near future , " said bush , who added that developed as well as emerging economies would be included .
" we 're dealing with a significant problem . "
bush and sarkozy , who was representing the 27-member european union as the current president , emphasized their continuing support for free market economies and opposition to protectionism and isolationism .
it is " essential we preserve the foundation of democratic capitalism , " bush said .
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
agreement on the summit was announced immediately after sarkozy and barroso arrived at camp david from an eu-canada summit in quebec city .
sarkozy has been pushing for such a conference for weeks , as the first waves of financial panic washed across the atlantic from the us to european stock markets and banking systems .
the summit will review steps being taken by the us and europe to rescue the financial system , including banks and other finance firms , from being pulled down through the collapse of the housing bubble .
world leaders will also " seek agreement on principles of reform " needed to avoid another failure and " assure global prosperity in the future , " the three men said in the statement .
a global crisis needs a global voice , says sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso and sarkozy brought the eu 's vision to the us " first and foremost , this is a worldwide crisis and we must find a worldwide solution , " sarkozy said .
the goal of the emergency summit , sarkozy said , was to " speak with one and the same voice . "
" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .
un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "
" the sort of capitalism we have witnessed is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in , " he added .
calls for a new " bretton woods " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown aim to rebuild the global finance system both sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown have called for the summit to be a " new bretton woods . "
sarkozy has said it is " necessary to rebuild the entire global financial and monetary system from the bottom up . "
in july 1944 , an agreement was signed in bretton woods , new hampshire , that established new rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states .
sarkozy said eu leaders planned to go to asia next week to discuss the crisis .
the goal of the summit is to discuss ideas about how to prevent the recurrence of the wave of financial failures that have forced governments to intervene hugely in capital markets and the banking system .
sarkozy and barroso also called for the building of a new financial order and new global capitalism system .
sarkozy denounced the failures in the us system that had led to the global crisis .
series of emergency meetings to begin in november the expanded idea of a series of meetings was put forth in a statement issued after the men finished meeting .
the g20 finance ministers are planning to meet from november 7-9 in brazil , but it was not clear if that meeting would be connected to the emergency finance summit .
the g20 includes the g8 most industrialized countries -lrb- us , canada , italy , germany , britain , france , japan , russia -rrb- and argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , and the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we must make haste because we must stabilize the market place as swiftly as possible ...
once calm has been restored , we must avoid at all costs that those who have led us to where we are today should be allowed to do so again , " sarkozy said .
the french president indicated the meeting could take place in new york , where things began unraveling , and possibly before the end of november , but bush was vague about the details .
" insofar as this crisis began in new york , then the global solution must be found in new york , " sarkozy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 19.10.2008 global financial crisis cages the celtic tiger großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is n't so bright for these sons of the previously powerful celtic tiger the choked voices on the airwaves telling tales of job losses , repossessions , debt and downright misery signal the seismic shift in ireland 's economy that has caught thousands unaware . one such voice is that of kathleen , a mother of four , who sobs as she describes how she was given a sub-prime mortgage to redecorate the family home she inherited .
with arrears of 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9413.6 -rrb- , she is now in danger of losing that home as interest rate increases meant that her repayments jumped from 1,600 to 2,300 euros a month .
" i just could n't afford it any more , " she said .
with her husband 's income dwindling as he was dependent on the ailing construction sector and the mortgage company threatening " to go legal " she could see no way out and was feeling suicidal .
the couple 's combined earnings of 3,000 euros a month meant that she should only have been allowed about 90,000 euros in a mortgage instead of the 260,000 which a sub-prime lender , owned by failed us investment bank , lehman , loaned the family .
" i can see no way out .
i just want to get back to the way i was .
i just want to be happy for my children , " said the woman , who would only use her first name when she spoke to irish national broadcaster rte last week .
celtic tiger boom a thing of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " do you know ' brother can you spare a dime ' ? "
such stories are a far cry from the heady swagger of the days of the celtic tiger boom , and ireland is shocked at the speed of the crash .
" people are dropping like flies from the construction and engineering sector , " says fergus mcgabhann , an engineer in his 40s who has just received notice that he is losing his job in one month 's time .
" it 's all changed , " says mcgabhann , who has also lost money in a government-promoted savings scheme , the value of which has plummeted .
" this means that the reserves i had are depleted and i do n't have time to sit and wait it out .
i ca n't really afford to stay here now , " he told the dpa news agency .
his daily commute to ringaskiddy , which is home to the pharmaceutical industry near cork in south-west ireland , has changed beyond recognition .
" the traffic jams are all gone , " he says .
" the car parks are empty .
we have had troughs before , but you would find small jobs to keep you going .
this time all the big projects have been cancelled and small jobs have all dried up too . "
he feels as if he is left with no choice but to leave .
" i have done it before , but this is the first time i have to do it with small children and i am not looking forward to it , " he said .
unemployment rising sharply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction industry has been hit with jobs lost the combined effects of the global credit crisis and the construction slump have meant that unemployment in ireland has increased by 49 per cent in the last year and is expected to hit 7.3 per cent next year .
according to the september figures from the central statistics office , the numbers receiving unemployment benefit have risen to 244,500 , a massive 48-per-cent rise on september 2007 and the highest in 11 years .
those who are in employment feel they can do little to secure themselves against what may be worse times to come .
jackie gowran , who is self-employed , had hoped to downsize from a four-bedroomed house to a three-bedroomed one , but the housing market downturn has meant that her house has remained unsold after a year .
" the credit crunch does restrict your options .
it was n't crucial for me to sell , but the reality is i wanted to downsize and i have n't been able to , " she said .
" in terms of being self-employed , it would make you sit up and take notice .
i have enough work lined up for the next six months , but after that it might be different . " dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
it booked the largest number of visitors in its 60-year-history . with an attendance of 78,218 on saturday alone , the fair easily exceeded all previous attendance figures , in a year that saw turkey feature as the show 's guest of honor . closing the show on sunday were readings by bestselling irish author cecilia ahern - daughter of former irish prime minister bertie ahern - and berlin cult-writer martina brandl . the fair is a vital part of the world publishing industry , as the fair is the world 's principal meeting place for world book publishing and a marketplace for book rights . the participation of turkey as this year 's guest of honor at the fair has underlined the country 's controversial balance between traditionalism and free speech . amnesty : book fair will help rights in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt welcomed nobel prize winner orhan pamuk to the fair global rights organization amnesty international said on sunday that turkey 's status as guest nation at the fair will have a positive effect on freedom of expression in the country . " it does n't change the situation in turkey yet , of course , but it is a step on the path towards breaking taboos , " amnesty 's turkey expert amke dietert told german news agency dpa .
" as long as there are serious restrictions in turkey , we ca n't talk about freedom of expression .

19 . art historian and publicist werner spies gave a speech honoring kiefer at the ceremony .
the boersenverein , the german book publishers ' and book-sellers ' association , said kiefer was an internationally renowned artist " who confronts his time with the disturbing moral message of the ruinous and the ephemeral . "
in his work , the 63-year-old artist also grappled with literature and poetry , a statement from the prize jury said .
the book and its form were the primary conveyor of expression for kiefer , the jury said .
the award comes with a cash prize of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- and is usually given to book authors who promote international understanding .
kiefer , 63 , who lives has lived in france since 1993 , is the first artist to be given the annual prize .
on friday , kiefer called peace " an unachievable utopia . "
" there is no such thing as final peace , " kiefer told reporters .
" peace is a utopia , something that can never be achieved .
it has to be created every day anew in our heads .
it is a struggle . "
kiefer 's anti-war art includes warplanes made of battered lead which are now exhibited in the louisiana museum , one of europe 's top contemporary art galleries , north of the danish capital copenhagen .
kiefer said friday he wrote a diary daily and had nearly become a writer instead of an artist .
the award ceremonies came as meanwhile the international frankfurt book fair was in its final day on sunday after a five-day run .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .

" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .

de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .
tadic looking for un approval before agreeing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic opposes to eulex but un approval could change that serbian president boris tadic said earlier this week that the agreement over eulex deployment between belgrade and the eu was possible , but insisted it could be reached only by obtaining a green light from the un security council for the mission .
de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

un secretary general ban ki-moon has offered to host the summit at the united nations , which would lend " universal legitimacy to this endeavor , " the french daily le figaro reported , quoting a letter from ban to sarkozy .
eu and us should build a capitalism of the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants the eu to work closely with the us sarkozy , who thanked president bush for using his term of office " right up until the very end , " said europe wanted to work " hand in glove " with the us in building " the capitalism of the future . "
" we can not continue along the same lines , " sarkozy vowed .
" hedge funds can not continue operating as they have in the past . "
" this is no longer acceptable , this is no longer possible , " the french president said .
" this sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
sarkozy noted it would be " catastrophic " to close borders and " challenge the foundation of market economies . "
he said the world must crack down on tax havens , and on financial institutions that are under no supervisory control .
" this is no longer acceptable , " he added .
sarkozy said the goal of the emergency summit was to " build together a capitalism of the future together . "
" the sort of capitalism we have witnessed is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in , " he added .
calls for a new " bretton woods " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and brown aim to rebuild the global finance system both sarkozy and british prime minister gordon brown have called for the summit to be a " new bretton woods . "
sarkozy has said it is " necessary to rebuild the entire global financial and monetary system from the bottom up . "
in july 1944 , an agreement was signed in bretton woods , new hampshire , that established new rules for commercial and financial relations among the world 's major industrial states .
sarkozy said eu leaders planned to go to asia next week to discuss the crisis .
the goal of the summit is to discuss ideas about how to prevent the recurrence of the wave of financial failures that have forced governments to intervene hugely in capital markets and the banking system .
sarkozy and barroso also called for the building of a new financial order and new global capitalism system .
sarkozy denounced the failures in the us system that had led to the global crisis .
series of emergency meetings to begin in november the expanded idea of a series of meetings was put forth in a statement issued after the men finished meeting .
the g20 finance ministers are planning to meet from november 7-9 in brazil , but it was not clear if that meeting would be connected to the emergency finance summit .
the g20 includes the g8 most industrialized countries -lrb- us , canada , italy , germany , britain , france , japan , russia -rrb- and argentina , australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , saudi arabia , south africa , south korea , turkey , and the european union . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only when buddhist monks approcah does he remember that he 's not in his hometonw in the moselle but in burma . aythaya vineyards is the brainchild of bert morsbach , who relocated from thailand years ago , where he manufactured surf boards . almost 10 years ago , he leased a plot of land at an elevation of 1,300 meters near inle lake , about an hour 's flight time north-east of burma 's main port city of yangon . morsbach then experimented a few years with vines imported from germany and consulted numerous wine experts .
eventually , his efforts bore fruit and he went into serious production . about two years ago , he hired leiendecker , 50 , a well-known vintner from the moselle town of bernkastel in western germany , who has won prizes for the excellence of his vintages . now he produces in burma .
about 100,000 bottles of sauvignon blanc are made there every year , and the 2007 vintage is already being touted as a breakthrough success . " the quality is comparable to similar vintages from europe , chile and australia , " leiendecker said . many five-star hotels in the country are carrying the vintage on their wine lists , but it is also served in the restaurant that is part of the vineyard and where leiendecker lives . the terrace with a view of the plantation is currently being expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors . " we need more space to host weddings and company outings , " leiendecker said . more chairs are needed , and more china . " chinese weddings require a lot of small bowls and at least one waiter for every three tables , but at burmese weddings , one waiter is usually enough to tend to up to seven tables , " leiendecker said .
" just three years ago , i would never have dreamed that i once would have to distinguish between chinese and burmese weddings , " he added . wine market focused locally the vineyard has to focus its marketing locally because burma 's tourism industry is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monk-led demos brought unwanted publicity last year 's brutal suppression by the ruling military junta of monk-led protests and the subsequent devastation left behind by cyclone nargis in may have resulted in dwindling tourist numbers . " many people are under the impression that the entire country was devastated by the cyclone , which is , of course , not the case , " leiendecker explained . while the cyclone rampaged through the irrawaddy river delta and the coastline in burma 's south , the rest of the country escaped unharmed . aythaya vineyards is located near inle lake , which , with its stilted bungalow resorts , hotels and rustic villages , used to attract thousands of foreign tourists each year . nowadays , many of the hotels are either closed or deserted . leiendecker has recently begun to raise the output of " kanbosa , " a full and fruity red wine , " rather on the sweet side , " he said . it might not be the choice of an expert red wine lover but caters to local tastes , he said .
" we have to slowly introduce the locals to wine , " leiendecker said . two young women are sitting on stools and pasting labels on filled bottles .
" it 's all done manually here because we do n't have any expensive machinery to do the work , " leiendecker said . the vineyard employs about 60 people and primarily cultures shiraz and sauvignon grapes . pruning the vines takes place in october and harvesting is in april . investor interest despite poor soil and low yield bildunterschrift : the slopes above leiendecker 's hometown are very fertile in comparison to burma since the soil is poorer than in germany 's moselle region and because the vines do not receive much sunshine during the rainy season from april to october , the yield is rather small . " in germany , we may get between 10,000 and 12,000 liters of wine per hectare , but here it is only about 3,000 liters , " leiendecker said . morsbach has found a number of german investors for his vineyard project , but it was n't easy .
he still is often confronted with doubts about whether one should invest at all in a country under a repressive military regime . " we are n't here because of the military junta but despite of it , " he said . morsbach has fallen in love with the locals and insisted that sanctions and holding back investments would only play into the hands of the military and isolate the population .
leiendecker agreed .
he has enjoyed his stay in burma and intends to remain against all political odds , he said .
" it is pioneer work , and we literally have to build everything from scratch as there is no support from the military government , " he said . he is currently also overseeing construction of a row of bungalows to accommodate golfers and trekkers . the only thing that he sometimes misses is cheese , he said , which would go nicely with his wines . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year 's slowdown and the credit crunch affecting banks are cutting divorce rates by as much as 30 percent . " it has become extremely difficult for couples wanting to divorce to sell their home at a reasonable price , and the crisis is also making it harder to maintain two separate households , " madrid divorce lawyer antonio prada told the dpa news agency .
as a result , couples which no longer have anything to say to each other stay under the same roof , developing what prada calls " new forms of living together . "
divorce rates went into a clear decline earlier this year , when the meltdown of spain 's key property sector and the international economic conjuncture put an abrupt end to more than a decade of uninterrupted growth .
growth has now plunged from 3.8 percent in 2007 to close to zero , and unemployment has soared past 10 per cent .
prices of used housing dropped by more than 10 per cent in the first nine months of this year , according to the property valuation company tinsa .
bailout plans could have an effect on marriages the government is now planning to inject up to 150 billion euros -lrb- $ 200 billion -rrb- into the financial system to shore up banks .
if the plan fails , the collapse of housing prices and the difficulties to obtain mortgages could discourage divorces further , analysts say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a couple 's differences may not be as serious as bankruptcy " couples which intended to divorce may even stay together permanently , " prada says .
" the economic crisis would thus help to preserve marriages " in cases where the partners have at least friendly relations , he explains .
couples which can not stand the sight of each other , however , are resorting to " internet divorces " based on standard contracts supplied by law firms charging low fees .
this is not necessarily leading to happier times for those involved though .
" contracts supplied over the internet always create problems , because they do not deal with the details of dividing property , child custody and other specifics in each individual case , " prada warns .
the number of divorces has increased steadily since spain legalized the procedure in 1981 , with more than 100,000 couples untying the knot annually .
prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero 's socialist government made divorce easier in 2005 .
however , prada says the reform did not increase divorces on a large scale , because its main novelty - the abolition of the concept of the guilty party - was already being applied in practice .

the phenomenon became visible already in 2007 , when the number of people moving out of their parents ' homes increased only 2.8 percent , down from 5 per cent in previous years , said jose luis arroyo of the spanish youth council .

only when buddhist monks approcah does he remember that he 's not in his hometonw in the moselle but in burma . aythaya vineyards is the brainchild of bert morsbach , who relocated from thailand years ago , where he manufactured surf boards . almost 10 years ago , he leased a plot of land at an elevation of 1,300 meters near inle lake , about an hour 's flight time north-east of burma 's main port city of yangon . morsbach then experimented a few years with vines imported from germany and consulted numerous wine experts .
eventually , his efforts bore fruit and he went into serious production . about two years ago , he hired leiendecker , 50 , a well-known vintner from the moselle town of bernkastel in western germany , who has won prizes for the excellence of his vintages . now he produces in burma .
about 100,000 bottles of sauvignon blanc are made there every year , and the 2007 vintage is already being touted as a breakthrough success . " the quality is comparable to similar vintages from europe , chile and australia , " leiendecker said . many five-star hotels in the country are carrying the vintage on their wine lists , but it is also served in the restaurant that is part of the vineyard and where leiendecker lives . the terrace with a view of the plantation is currently being expanded to accommodate increasing numbers of visitors . " we need more space to host weddings and company outings , " leiendecker said . more chairs are needed , and more china . " chinese weddings require a lot of small bowls and at least one waiter for every three tables , but at burmese weddings , one waiter is usually enough to tend to up to seven tables , " leiendecker said .
" just three years ago , i would never have dreamed that i once would have to distinguish between chinese and burmese weddings , " he added . wine market focused locally the vineyard has to focus its marketing locally because burma 's tourism industry is stagnant . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monk-led demos brought unwanted publicity last year 's brutal suppression by the ruling military junta of monk-led protests and the subsequent devastation left behind by cyclone nargis in may have resulted in dwindling tourist numbers . " many people are under the impression that the entire country was devastated by the cyclone , which is , of course , not the case , " leiendecker explained . while the cyclone rampaged through the irrawaddy river delta and the coastline in burma 's south , the rest of the country escaped unharmed . aythaya vineyards is located near inle lake , which , with its stilted bungalow resorts , hotels and rustic villages , used to attract thousands of foreign tourists each year . nowadays , many of the hotels are either closed or deserted . leiendecker has recently begun to raise the output of " kanbosa , " a full and fruity red wine , " rather on the sweet side , " he said . it might not be the choice of an expert red wine lover but caters to local tastes , he said .
" we have to slowly introduce the locals to wine , " leiendecker said . two young women are sitting on stools and pasting labels on filled bottles .
" it 's all done manually here because we do n't have any expensive machinery to do the work , " leiendecker said . the vineyard employs about 60 people and primarily cultures shiraz and sauvignon grapes . pruning the vines takes place in october and harvesting is in april . investor interest despite poor soil and low yield bildunterschrift : the slopes above leiendecker 's hometown are very fertile in comparison to burma since the soil is poorer than in germany 's moselle region and because the vines do not receive much sunshine during the rainy season from april to october , the yield is rather small . " in germany , we may get between 10,000 and 12,000 liters of wine per hectare , but here it is only about 3,000 liters , " leiendecker said . morsbach has found a number of german investors for his vineyard project , but it was n't easy .
he still is often confronted with doubts about whether one should invest at all in a country under a repressive military regime . " we are n't here because of the military junta but despite of it , " he said . morsbach has fallen in love with the locals and insisted that sanctions and holding back investments would only play into the hands of the military and isolate the population .
leiendecker agreed .
he has enjoyed his stay in burma and intends to remain against all political odds , he said .
" it is pioneer work , and we literally have to build everything from scratch as there is no support from the military government , " he said . he is currently also overseeing construction of a row of bungalows to accommodate golfers and trekkers . the only thing that he sometimes misses is cheese , he said , which would go nicely with his wines . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french demonstrators unfurled a banner proclaiming " bridges , not walls " at the paris rally .
other signs that read : " we are all immigrant children " and " detention centers are lawless places , a state secret . "
in le mans , central france , a 60-year-old woman doused herself in flammable liquid in front of a detention centre and set herself on fire in protest at authorities ' threats to deport her partner back to armenia .
the paris rally along with a ' citizens summit ' was organized by some 300 international ngos , many of them from african nations .
its organizers adopted a declaration friday evening expressing their dismay at a policy " which would turn europe into a fortress . "
new eu immigration pact prompts demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu agreed sweeping measures which tighten laws adopted thursday by leaders of the 27-member european union , the european pact on immigration and asylum - a document of political intent but not binding laws - sets out principles for managing migration , fighting illegal immigration and forming partnerships with countries people leave or travel through to get to europe .
it also seeks to make border controls more effective while building better asylum policy , with refugees increasingly obliged to apply for asylum status from outside the bloc .
britain 's new immigration minister has already promised to impose tougher restrictions as the country 's unemployment rate looks set to soar to its highest level in nearly a decade .
" it 's been too easy to get into this country in the past and it 's going to get harder , " phil woolas told the times newspaper in an interview published saturday .
in a dramatic change of policy , the labour government intends to place a limit on immigration , according to the daily .
" there has to be a balance between the number of people coming in and the number of people leaving , " said woolas .
the minister said his government would not allow britain 's population to grow to 70 million people .
britain 's population grew by about 3.4 percent to almost 61 million people between 2001 and 2007 fuelled by expansion of the european union , according to latest figures from the office for national statistics .
britain 's unemployment rate jumped to an eight-year high of 5.7 percent in the three months to august , official data showed on wednesday .
the 5.7-percent unemployment rate was the highest since the three months to march , 2000 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority proclaimed independence from serbia on february 17 , a move that has been recognized more than 50 countries , including most of the eu members and the united states .
but the serb minority - some 100,000 who have remained in kosovo - are backed by belgrade and its powerful ally russia in rejecting the independence of the territory which they still consider as serbia 's southern province .
ethnic serbs living in northern kosovo , where they make a majority , fiercely oppose eulex 's deployment , considering it would indirectly mean the recognition of kosovo 's independence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves de kermabon hopes the opposition will dissipate " i think it will be possible to really kick off the mission in early december , in its first , initial phase , having in mind that we will again need a little more time , undoubtedly , to gather all personnel in order to be fully deployed throughout kosovo , " de kermabon said in an interview with the afp news agency .
in february , the eu decided to deploy eulex in kosovo , to replace the united nations mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- that has administered the territory since the end of 1998-1999 war there .
opposition in serbia sees eulex as illegal but belgrade , as well as kosovo serbs , consider eulex illegal without the approval of the un security council for its deployment .
the mission should comprise some 2,000 police , justice and customs officials , in charge of " improving the rule of law and rights " in kosovo , de kermabon said .
they will be assisted by about 1,000 local staff .
" eulex will not be deployed by force , " the french official said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un mission in kosovo could work with the eu he indicated a possibility of a joint eulex and unmik deployment in serb-populated northern kosovo , in order to provide an easier transition .
" this is not impossible , in a transitional period which will have to be shortest possible , " he said .
" i hope that before the end of winter at the latest , eulex will be fully deployed throughout kosovo . "
the french official also indicated that an " accord " with belgrade over the disputed issue " is not far away " .
" this is my feeling , but i remain prudent , " he said .
tadic looking for un approval before agreeing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic opposes to eulex but un approval could change that serbian president boris tadic said earlier this week that the agreement over eulex deployment between belgrade and the eu was possible , but insisted it could be reached only by obtaining a green light from the un security council for the mission .
de kermabon estimated that it was in the interest of the serbian authorities to have eulex working also in the north of kosovo .
opposition to its deployment came from a " certain number of fanatics in the north , who are still holding a part of the population under their control , " he said .
if belgrade " wants to put an end to smuggling and corruption in the north , it will be necessary for them to get rid of these fanatics sooner or later , " de kermabon said .
the north , without obvious police or customs control , has become " the biggest smuggling zone " , de kermabon estimated , noting especially untaxed traffic of petrol .
serbs say cooperation will be impossible a serb representatives in kosovo , nebojsa jovic , reiterated his opposition to eulex deployment , estimating that it " will be impossible to cooperate " with the eu-led mission .
jovic said he doubted eulex 's capability to protect the rights of minority serbs .
" how can they talk about protecting human rights when some 250,000 serbs can not return to kosovo ? " he asked , in a reference to those who have left the territory since 1999 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kemble air services are the preferred bidders to lease llanbedr airfield near harlech , gwynedd , but agreeing the deal has been delayed .
it follows claims by the snowdonia society the assembly government broke the law by arranging a 125 year lease .
the assembly government said it was considering its options .
if the plans had come to fruition the airfield would already have been leased to commercial air operators kemble .
but the signing of that lease was aborted at the 11th hour last may . "
we believe that the assembly government has acted without due legal process , indeed has broken the law in dealing with this matter " alun pugh as a result there is no new commercial airfield and the company who were to run it have been left in limbo .
kemble spokesman david young told the bbc 's politics show wales programme : " if this got , for any reasons , so much more complicated that there is going to be a cost penalty to the company , there will reach a point where we ca n't continue .
" and where on earth they 're going to find another investor to go to llanbedr now - a year after , a year on when the world has turned completely , i do n't know . "
director of the snowdonia society and former culture minister alun pugh argues the assembly government failed to observe its duty under section 62 of the environment act to " have regard " to the statutory purposes of a national park like snowdonia when taking decisions which effect it .
on thursday , the society took that claim to the assembly 's petitions committee .
mr pugh said : " we believe that the assembly government has acted without due legal process , indeed has broken the law in dealing with this matter but fortunately there is a way forward . "
if we knew at llanbedr that we were going to face a similar long , prolonged , very expensive process ... then i think we 'd have to cut and run " david young " we believe that the welsh government should now apply for planning permission and make a clear statement of the future intended uses of the site . "
kemble say planning permission for aviation uses is not required as llanbedr was an mod airfield until 2004 .
they say they just need a certificate of lawfulness for an existing use , formally establishing their right to continue aviation at llanbedr .
a long , costly , full planning process is not something they are prepared to face , particularly as they are already involved in a planning dispute with north wiltshire council over their air operation at kemble .
david young said : " if we knew at llanbedr that we were going to face a similar long , prolonged , very expensive process with no guarantee of getting our costs back then i think we 'd have to cut and run .
" the ministers have got to say ' enough !
section 62 is answered , we must pursue our policy with this airfield and with this excellent plan from kemble to regenerate llanbedr airfield and get on with it ' .
they need to do that .
" they really need to get to grips with this because anything else , planning enquiries , judicial reviews , whatever , would be a tragedy for llanbedr .
it 's going to knock it back 10 years or more . "
those from llanbedr who welcome the jobs and regeneration the airfield 's would-be developers promise also presented a petition to the assembly 's committee on thursday , signed by more than 1,200 people .
the petition against the airfield was only signed by 156 people .
the pro-airfield lobby are deeply concerned that kemble might pull out of the deal .
pro-airfield petitioner gwynli jones said : " i think i could go as far as to say it would be impossible to find somebody else like kemble .
" i 've flown down to kemble a few times and it 's well organised .
i 'd like to see them come up to llanbedr to do the same there . "
the minister responsible , ieuan wyn jones , was unavailable for interview .
a spokesman said the assembly government has sought legal advice regarding its compliance with certain provisions of the environment act following the snowdonia society 's challenge .
once this advice is complete , the deputy first minister will make a decision on the future of llanbedr .

advertisement the snowdonia society says the assembly government broke the law by arranging a 125-year lease mark hannaby bbc news a firm chosen to redevelop a former raf airfield says it may pull out of the deal if the assembly government does not resolve difficulties soon .
kemble air services are the preferred bidders to lease llanbedr airfield near harlech , gwynedd , but agreeing the deal has been delayed .
it follows claims by the snowdonia society the assembly government broke the law by arranging a 125 year lease .
the assembly government said it was considering its options .
if the plans had come to fruition the airfield would already have been leased to commercial air operators kemble .
but the signing of that lease was aborted at the 11th hour last may .
we believe that the assembly government has acted without due legal process , indeed has broken the law in dealing with this matter alun pugh as a result there is no new commercial airfield and the company who were to run it have been left in limbo .
kemble spokesman david young told the bbc 's politics show wales programme : " if this got , for any reasons , so much more complicated that there is going to be a cost penalty to the company , there will reach a point where we ca n't continue .
" and where on earth they 're going to find another investor to go to llanbedr now - a year after , a year on when the world has turned completely , i do n't know . "
director of the snowdonia society and former culture minister alun pugh argues the assembly government failed to observe its duty under section 62 of the environment act to " have regard " to the statutory purposes of a national park like snowdonia when taking decisions which effect it .
on thursday , the society took that claim to the assembly 's petitions committee .
mr pugh said : " we believe that the assembly government has acted without due legal process , indeed has broken the law in dealing with this matter but fortunately there is a way forward .
if we knew at llanbedr that we were going to face a similar long , prolonged , very expensive process ... then i think we 'd have to cut and run david young " we believe that the welsh government should now apply for planning permission and make a clear statement of the future intended uses of the site . "
kemble say planning permission for aviation uses is not required as llanbedr was an mod airfield until 2004 .
they say they just need a certificate of lawfulness for an existing use , formally establishing their right to continue aviation at llanbedr .
a long , costly , full planning process is not something they are prepared to face , particularly as they are already involved in a planning dispute with north wiltshire council over their air operation at kemble .
david young said : " if we knew at llanbedr that we were going to face a similar long , prolonged , very expensive process with no guarantee of getting our costs back then i think we 'd have to cut and run .
plans to develop the airfield have been subject to delays " the ministers have got to say ' enough !
section 62 is answered , we must pursue our policy with this airfield and with this excellent plan from kemble to regenerate llanbedr airfield and get on with it ' .
they need to do that .
" they really need to get to grips with this because anything else , planning enquiries , judicial reviews , whatever , would be a tragedy for llanbedr .
it 's going to knock it back 10 years or more . "
those from llanbedr who welcome the jobs and regeneration the airfield 's would-be developers promise also presented a petition to the assembly 's committee on thursday , signed by more than 1,200 people .
the petition against the airfield was only signed by 156 people .
the pro-airfield lobby are deeply concerned that kemble might pull out of the deal .
pro-airfield petitioner gwynli jones said : " i think i could go as far as to say it would be impossible to find somebody else like kemble .
" i 've flown down to kemble a few times and it 's well organised .
i 'd like to see them come up to llanbedr to do the same there . "
the minister responsible , ieuan wyn jones , was unavailable for interview .
a spokesman said the assembly government has sought legal advice regarding its compliance with certain provisions of the environment act following the snowdonia society 's challenge .
once this advice is complete , the deputy first minister will make a decision on the future of llanbedr .

maerdy workingmen 's hall in rhondda was built in 1925 after a fire destroyed the original edwardian building .
rhondda cynon taf -lrb- rct -rrb- council said the empty building was now dangerous and was being demolished after a compulsory purchase order was granted .
the hall was once at the centre of community life and featured a cinema , library , reading room and snooker room .
the original hall was built in 1905 on the site of an old coffee tavern and reading room .
it was the mecca of maerdy peter blake , former head teacher the land was a gift from the landlords of the maerdy estate to the workmen of the local collieries .
the original building burned down in 1922 , killing its treasurer whose body was found in the caretaker 's cottage adjoining the main building .
the institute was reopened in 1925 after local miners raised £ 20,000 .
former maerdy junior school headteacher peter blake remembers the building being at the centre of community life .
" it was a social centre especially for us youngsters because we used to go to the pictures , " he said .
" there was a chap there who would shine his light to try to catch us holding hands with girls and literally give us a whack across the ear . "
the hall provided the community with a huge range of activities over the years and was home to drama groups , brass bands , choirs and dancers .
the original building was destroyed by fire in 1922 " it was the mecca of maerdy , " said mr blake .
" it 's a huge landmark to be taken out but it 's a rotten tooth that has to go .
it 's just an eyesore now . "
over the next few months , fixtures and fittings will be removed before the structure itself is demolished .
the council said many organisations had expressed an interest in reusing the old stone from the building .
" it would be nice to know that parts of a building with such a rich history are preserved for others to enjoy , " said rct cabinet member for economic development and housing , councillor paul cannon .

the finance ministry , the central bank and the financial services commission said about $ 100bn of borrowing would be covered by the package .
the government will also provide $ 30bn of liquidity to banks , and there will be more aid to small businesses .
south korea 's economy is the third largest in asia and 13th in the world .
it enjoys major export success in a number of manufacturing industries , but especially shipbuilding , car-making , and electronics .
however , the country has appeared particularly vulnerable to the global credit crisis because its banks lacked sufficient dollars to service maturing foreign debt .
falling currency in a statement , the government said it would guarantee for three years all external debt taken on by south korean banks before 30 june 2009 in order " to avoid placing domestic banks at a comparative disadvantage in terms of overseas funding and to allay fears in the financial market " .
a further $ 750m will be injected into the industrial bank of korea , so it can expand lending to small businesses .
the shortage of dollars is having a dramatic effect on the country 's exchange rate , making it more difficult for businesses and individuals to get access to credit , says the bbc 's john sudworth in seoul .
the south korean won has fallen by almost 30 % against the dollar this year making it asia 's worst performing major currency .
the government said that despite the crisis , the economy and the financial sector were " sound " , and that its foreign exchange reserves were " sufficient " .
the us , the eu and other governments have also announced multi-billion dollar packages aimed at stabilising markets .

the finance ministry , the central bank and the financial services commission said about $ 100bn of borrowing would be covered by the package .
the government will also provide $ 30bn of liquidity to banks , and there will be more aid to small businesses .
south korea 's economy is the third largest in asia and 13th in the world .
it enjoys major export success in a number of manufacturing industries , but especially shipbuilding , car-making , and electronics .
however , the country has appeared particularly vulnerable to the global credit crisis because its banks lacked sufficient dollars to service maturing foreign debt .
falling currency in a statement , the government said it would guarantee for three years all external debt taken on by south korean banks before 30 june 2009 in order " to avoid placing domestic banks at a comparative disadvantage in terms of overseas funding and to allay fears in the financial market " .
a further $ 750m will be injected into the industrial bank of korea , so it can expand lending to small businesses .
the shortage of dollars is having a dramatic effect on the country 's exchange rate , making it more difficult for businesses and individuals to get access to credit , says the bbc 's john sudworth in seoul .
the south korean won has fallen by almost 30 % against the dollar this year making it asia 's worst performing major currency .
the government said that despite the crisis , the economy and the financial sector were " sound " , and that its foreign exchange reserves were " sufficient " .
the us , the eu and other governments have also announced multi-billion dollar packages aimed at stabilising markets .

"
those words , parroted so often over the last few months by indian politicians and financial officials , may now ring a little hollow .
the truth of the matter is , india has been affected by the liquidity crunch - though arguably not as badly as other parts of the world have been .
at least not yet .
but the downturn in the west now appears to have reached india 's shores .
the indian stock market is the most obvious and evident victim of the global credit crunch - having lost more than half of its value since the crisis began .
that is because billions of dollars of foreign funds were pulled out of indian shares , as foreign fund managers scrambled to get their books in order .
losing money concerns are growing here about a global recession and what that might mean for the 300 million strong indian middle classes .
many indian professionals have put their savings into the stock market and into mutual funds over the last few years , tempted by the spectacular returns they saw .
one such investor is sony bhatia , 34 , a software developer .
outside the bombay stock exchange , staring up at the big flashing screens outside the stock market , he is dismayed by the plethora of red arrows pointing down .
" how could this happen ? " he asks .
" just three months ago i put in a huge amount of money .
everyone said ' this is the bottom - now the markets can only go up ' .
now i 've lost over half of that . "
property falls it is not just in the indian stock markets that people here are feeling the effects of the global credit crunch .
investors have seen the value of their shares plunge the property sector has also been bruised .
until recently , property prices in mumbai were on par with manhattan 's , boosted by scores of foreign firms coming into the financial capital , looking to set up shop here .
that foreign money also helped to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for india 's young middle classes , who could now finally afford to realise their dream of owning their own home .
all that demand for flats and houses caused prices to soar 40 % in some of the big cities in india last year .
but now much of that money and demand has evaporated - leaving property developers out in the cold .
already prices are down some 10-15 % , with forecasts of a bigger crash around the corner .
real estate agent harsh mukri , once the envy of his friends because of the large commissions he used to make on his deals , says he is very worried .
" it 's hard to get anyone to buy a house these days , " he says .
" no bank is willing to give loans .
" my business has completely dried up .
even renting out flats to foreign companies - a huge profit earner for us - has gone down .
people are n't coming here as much as they used to . "
foreign fuel other businesses are also being hit by this reluctance to lend on the part of the banks , as financial institutions in india continue to hold on to their liquid funds .
" the first impact is the fear of lending " , says r balakrishnan , the executive director of centrum capital in a recent editorial .
" more than a credit squeeze , india is confronted with a liquidity crisis of a severe magnitude .
" the last few years of india 's growth has been fuelled by foreign capital .
domestic money can not provide the platform for growth . "
the indian financial authorities have tried to take measures to increase more liquidity in the banking system - and just a few days ago pumped in $ 8bn worth of funds into the markets .
but that 's still not managed to raise sentiment amongst investors and consumers - which is making life tough for retailers in india .
" people are n't buying jewelry this year at the rate they were last year , " says ramesh bherumal , a gold and diamond jewelry store owner in mumbai 's busy and crowded jewelry market zaveri bazar .
" sales are down 30 % , and it 's the same story in other shops too - cars , electronic goods , washing machines .
you name it , people have just stopped spending . "
seismic shift at the jmd auto car showroom in mumbai , the mood is similarly sombre .
girish vazirani has run the showroom for the last few years .
he says he has never seen it so bad .
" there 's no demand , " he says .
" people are n't interested in buying .
" the market sentiment is so bad , plus every day you 're seeing bad news on television and in the newspapers .
consumers are psychologically turned off spending . "
this is particularly worrying .
there had been a theory that since so much of india 's economy is powered by domestic consumption , that india would largely be able to escape the global credit crunch .
but with a seismic shift in the attitude toward spending amongst indian middle classes - there 's a real fear growing here that growth rates in the future could seriously be at risk .

outside the bombay stock exchange , staring up at the big flashing screens outside the stock market , he is dismayed by the plethora of red arrows pointing down .
" how could this happen ? " he asks .
" just three months ago i put in a huge amount of money .
everyone said ' this is the bottom - now the markets can only go up ' .
now i 've lost over half of that . "
property falls it is not just in the indian stock markets that people here are feeling the effects of the global credit crunch .
investors have seen the value of their shares plunge the property sector has also been bruised .
until recently , property prices in mumbai were on par with manhattan 's , boosted by scores of foreign firms coming into the financial capital , looking to set up shop here .
that foreign money also helped to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for india 's young middle classes , who could now finally afford to realise their dream of owning their own home .
all that demand for flats and houses caused prices to soar 40 % in some of the big cities in india last year .
but now much of that money and demand has evaporated - leaving property developers out in the cold .
already prices are down some 10-15 % , with forecasts of a bigger crash around the corner .
real estate agent harsh mukri , once the envy of his friends because of the large commissions he used to make on his deals , says he is very worried .
" it 's hard to get anyone to buy a house these days , " he says .
" no bank is willing to give loans .
" my business has completely dried up .
even renting out flats to foreign companies - a huge profit earner for us - has gone down .

no wonder , given that for the past month , a spoof sarah palin , played by comedian tina fey , had been sending up the republican vice-presidential candidate on the very same programme .
ms fey 's impressions had gained attention and laughs for the uncanny likeness between her and governor palin - the look , the mannerisms and the accent .
only a week ago , she had said she had wanted to appear on the show .
now she was finally on it .
would she mimic the woman who had been mimicking her ?
would we see both real and fake mrs palin side-by-side in a sketch ?
would mrs palin feature with the show 's spoof john mccain ?
comedy sidekick in the actual event none of the above happened , but what we got was mrs palin alongside hollywood stars alec baldwin and mark wahlberg as well as cast members from the show .
in many ways it was the sort of performance you would expect from a politician running for office .
the best and most risque gags were delivered by those she starred with , rather than by mrs palin herself .
the alaskan governor played the role of the comedy sidekick , but also came across as someone who did not take herself too seriously , happy to laugh at the jokes made at her expense .
the show opened with a mock news conference , announcing that sarah palin was due to speak , but instead of the real governor , out walked the fake one played by tina fey .
in the spoof meeting fey as palin spoke to the assembled press pack : " i just want to say how excited i am to be in front of both the liberal elite media , as well as the liberal regular media . "
it was after this " news conference " that we finally got to see the real sarah palin , watching her lookalike on a screen backstage .
" i just did n't think it was a realistic depiction of the way my press conferences would 've gone , " she told the show 's executive producer lorne michaels .
" why could n't we have done the 30 rock sketch that i wrote ? " she said in reference to the hit us comedy which tina fey stars in .
many viewers may have been thinking the same .
there had been speculation ahead of this performance that a role reversal with mrs palin mocking tina fey was on the cards , or that the pair would appear together .
gut instinct in the event the closest we got to witnessing the latter was when the pair momentarily passed each other in the opening sketch .
but even without her doppelganger by her side there were some humorous exchanges .
mrs palin held her own with hollywood actor alec baldwin .
assuming he was talking to producer lorne michaels and tina fey , baldwin launched into an attack on sarah palin describing her as a " horrible woman " .
when he realised he was talking to the real sarah palin , he backtracked , telling her that she was " way hotter in person " .
her reply , was probably her funniest in the show .
" thank you , and i must say that your brother stephen is my favourite baldwin brother . "
in her second and final appearance towards the end of the show , sarah palin was seen on the set of a news show . "
my gut is telling me it might be a bad idea for the campaign , it might just cross the line " sarah palin on saturday night live in the sketch , comic actress amy poehler assumed the role of gov palin in a rap sequence where she was joined onstage by eskimos , a moose and a comedian playing todd palin , the governor 's husband .
although gov palin did not take part in the rap , she seemed more than happy to nod her head to the music , to lines such as : " when i say obama , you say ayers " and " i 'm jeremiah wright cuz tonight i 'm the preacher , i got a bookish look and you 're all hot for teacher " - references to accusations made about rival candidate barack obama 's associations .
before the rap began she told her comedy co-stars why , despite having rehearsed the rap , she would n't be performing it : " my gut is telling me it might be a bad idea for the campaign , it might just cross the line . "
there were those within her republican party who disliked the idea of their candidate being parodied on a liberal comedy show and felt any appearance on saturday night live would cross the line .
but judging by the smile on her face at the end of the show , sarah palin at least felt she had made the right decision .

only a week ago , she had said she had wanted to appear on the show .
now she was finally on it .
would she mimic the woman who had been mimicking her ?
would we see both real and fake mrs palin side-by-side in a sketch ?
would mrs palin feature with the show 's spoof john mccain ?
comedy sidekick in the actual event none of the above happened , but what we got was mrs palin alongside hollywood stars alec baldwin and mark wahlberg as well as cast members from the show .
in many ways it was the sort of performance you would expect from a politician running for office .
the best and most risque gags were delivered by those she starred with , rather than by mrs palin herself .
the alaskan governor played the role of the comedy sidekick , but also came across as someone who did not take herself too seriously , happy to laugh at the jokes made at her expense .
the show opened with a mock news conference , announcing that sarah palin was due to speak , but instead of the real governor , out walked the fake one played by tina fey .
tina fey impersonated sarah palin in a mock interview in the spoof meeting fey as palin spoke to the assembled press pack : " i just want to say how excited i am to be in front of both the liberal elite media , as well as the liberal regular media . "
it was after this " news conference " that we finally got to see the real sarah palin , watching her lookalike on a screen backstage .
" i just did n't think it was a realistic depiction of the way my press conferences would 've gone , " she told the show 's executive producer lorne michaels .
" why could n't we have done the 30 rock sketch that i wrote ? " she said in reference to the hit us comedy which tina fey stars in .
many viewers may have been thinking the same .
there had been speculation ahead of this performance that a role reversal with mrs palin mocking tina fey was on the cards , or that the pair would appear together .
gut instinct in the event the closest we got to witnessing the latter was when the pair momentarily passed each other in the opening sketch .
but even without her doppelganger by her side there were some humorous exchanges .
mrs palin held her own with hollywood actor alec baldwin .
assuming he was talking to producer lorne michaels and tina fey , baldwin launched into an attack on sarah palin describing her as a " horrible woman " .
when he realised he was talking to the real sarah palin , he backtracked , telling her that she was " way hotter in person " .
her reply , was probably her funniest in the show .
" thank you , and i must say that your brother stephen is my favourite baldwin brother . "
in her second and final appearance towards the end of the show , sarah palin was seen on the set of a news show .
my gut is telling me it might be a bad idea for the campaign , it might just cross the line sarah palin on saturday night live in the sketch , comic actress amy poehler assumed the role of gov palin in a rap sequence where she was joined onstage by eskimos , a moose and a comedian playing todd palin , the governor 's husband .
although gov palin did not take part in the rap , she seemed more than happy to nod her head to the music , to lines such as : " when i say obama , you say ayers " and " i 'm jeremiah wright cuz tonight i 'm the preacher , i got a bookish look and you 're all hot for teacher " - references to accusations made about rival candidate barack obama 's associations .
before the rap began she told her comedy co-stars why , despite having rehearsed the rap , she would n't be performing it : " my gut is telling me it might be a bad idea for the campaign , it might just cross the line . "
there were those within her republican party who disliked the idea of their candidate being parodied on a liberal comedy show and felt any appearance on saturday night live would cross the line .
but judging by the smile on her face at the end of the show , sarah palin at least felt she had made the right decision .

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement saturday night live courtesy of nbc and broadway video republican vice-presidential candidate sarah palin has joined her mimic in a much anticipated appearance on the us comedy show , saturday night live -lrb- snl -rrb- .
tina fey 's impersonations of sarah palin have proved a hit with millions of americans , thanks in part to her resemblance to the alaskan governor .
on the show , mrs palin showed she could join in on the jokes at her expense .
she played it straight as fey took her off , bopped to a comical rap and delivered snl 's famous opening line .
' garbage truck ' the nbc show began with a fake news conference where her spokesman told journalists " no recording devices and do n't write anything down " .
this is the most important election in our nation 's history and you want her , our tina , to go out there and stand with that horrible woman ?
alec baldwin joking about sarah palin on saturday night live palin plays it safe on us comedy tina fey then appeared as sarah palin , wearing a fitted red jacket and rimmed glasses .
" i am looking forward to a portion of your questions , " she said , a jibe at the way the republican vice-presidential candidate - and other politicians - have avoided answering a number of questions during the election campaign .
asked about her views on john mccain and barack obama in the last presidential debate , the fake mrs palin says of mr obama : " his words are smooth when he 's talking , he 's like an angel whispering in your ear .
he makes john mccain sound like a garbage truck unloading trash at a landfill . "
mrs palin , who has in the past said she loved tina fey 's impersonations , was first seen watching the show from the backstage with the show 's executive producer lorne michaels .
actor alec baldwin joins them , under the impression that mrs palin is tina fey .
" this is the most important election in our nation 's history and you want her , our tina , to go out there and stand with that horrible woman ? "
mr baldwin , a known left-winger , says to mr michaels .
told of his " mistake " , alec baldwin apologises .
but sarah palin retorts : " i must say , your brother stephen is my favourite baldwin brother . "
mrs palin then comes on stage to replace her mimic , who swiftly exits when she sees her .
" i 'm not going to take any of your questions , " she says .
" but i wanted to take this opportunity to say , " live from new york , it 's saturday night . "
dancing moose later in the show , mrs palin is seen bopping in her chair as cast member amy poehler raps a song which the vice-presidential candidate said would hurt her election campaign if she performed it herself .
fey 's looks , mannerisms and accent closely resemble palin 's during the song , eskimos , an impersonator of her husband todd and a large moose dance on stage .
at one point , mrs poehler shoots the moose who falls to the ground , a jibe at mrs palin 's passion for hunting and fondness for guns .
the bbc 's correspondent in washington , rajini vaidyanathan , says mrs palin 's performance on the show was in many ways what you would expect from a politician running for office .
the best and most risque gags were delivered by actors and snl cast members , rather than by sarah palin herself , she says .
our correspondent adds that mrs palin played the role of the comedy sidekick in the show , but did come across as someone who did not take herself too seriously and was happy to laugh at the jokes made at her expense .
fey 's spoof sarah palin has done wonders for saturday night live 's viewing figures .
ratings for the show have gone up , averaging 8.3 million viewers , and the sketches are drawing as many as 9.3 million hits online .
it is not clear whether republican presidential candidate john mccain watched the show , but earlier in the day said that he thought tina fey and his running mate were " separated at birth " .

advertisement saturday night live courtesy of nbc and broadway video republican vice-presidential candidate sarah palin has joined her mimic in a much anticipated appearance on the us comedy show , saturday night live -lrb- snl -rrb- .
tina fey 's impersonations of sarah palin have proved a hit with millions of americans , thanks in part to her resemblance to the alaskan governor .
on the show , mrs palin showed she could join in on the jokes at her expense .
she played it straight as fey took her off , bopped to a comical rap and delivered snl 's famous opening line .
' garbage truck ' the nbc show began with a fake news conference where her spokesman told journalists " no recording devices and do n't write anything down " .
this is the most important election in our nation 's history and you want her , our tina , to go out there and stand with that horrible woman ?
alec baldwin joking about sarah palin on saturday night live palin plays it safe on us comedy tina fey then appeared as sarah palin , wearing a fitted red jacket and rimmed glasses .
" i am looking forward to a portion of your questions , " she said , a jibe at the way the republican vice-presidential candidate - and other politicians - have avoided answering a number of questions during the election campaign .
asked about her views on john mccain and barack obama in the last presidential debate , the fake mrs palin says of mr obama : " his words are smooth when he 's talking , he 's like an angel whispering in your ear .
he makes john mccain sound like a garbage truck unloading trash at a landfill . "
mrs palin , who has in the past said she loved tina fey 's impersonations , was first seen watching the show from the backstage with the show 's executive producer lorne michaels .
actor alec baldwin joins them , under the impression that mrs palin is tina fey .
" this is the most important election in our nation 's history and you want her , our tina , to go out there and stand with that horrible woman ? "
mr baldwin , a known left-winger , says to mr michaels .
told of his " mistake " , alec baldwin apologises .
but sarah palin retorts : " i must say , your brother stephen is my favourite baldwin brother . "
mrs palin then comes on stage to replace her mimic , who swiftly exits when she sees her .
" i 'm not going to take any of your questions , " she says .
" but i wanted to take this opportunity to say , " live from new york , it 's saturday night . "
dancing moose later in the show , mrs palin is seen bopping in her chair as cast member amy poehler raps a song which the vice-presidential candidate said would hurt her election campaign if she performed it herself .
fey 's looks , mannerisms and accent closely resemble palin 's during the song , eskimos , an impersonator of her husband todd and a large moose dance on stage .
at one point , mrs poehler shoots the moose who falls to the ground , a jibe at mrs palin 's passion for hunting and fondness for guns .
the bbc 's correspondent in washington , rajini vaidyanathan , says mrs palin 's performance on the show was in many ways what you would expect from a politician running for office .
the best and most risque gags were delivered by actors and snl cast members , rather than by sarah palin herself , she says .
our correspondent adds that mrs palin played the role of the comedy sidekick in the show , but did come across as someone who did not take herself too seriously and was happy to laugh at the jokes made at her expense .
fey 's spoof sarah palin has done wonders for saturday night live 's viewing figures .
ratings for the show have gone up , averaging 8.3 million viewers , and the sketches are drawing as many as 9.3 million hits online .
it is not clear whether republican presidential candidate john mccain watched the show , but earlier in the day said that he thought tina fey and his running mate were " separated at birth " .

advertisement saturday night live courtesy of nbc and broadway video republican vice-presidential candidate sarah palin has joined her mimic in a much anticipated appearance on the us comedy show , saturday night live -lrb- snl -rrb- .
tina fey 's impersonations of sarah palin have proved a hit with millions of americans , thanks in part to her resemblance to the alaskan governor .
on the show , mrs palin showed she could join in on the jokes at her expense .
she played it straight as fey took her off , bopped to a comical rap and delivered snl 's famous opening line .
' garbage truck ' the nbc show began with a fake news conference where her spokesman told journalists " no recording devices and do n't write anything down " .
this is the most important election in our nation 's history and you want her , our tina , to go out there and stand with that horrible woman ?
alec baldwin joking about sarah palin on saturday night live palin plays it safe on us comedy tina fey then appeared as sarah palin , wearing a fitted red jacket and rimmed glasses .
" i am looking forward to a portion of your questions , " she said , a jibe at the way the republican vice-presidential candidate - and other politicians - have avoided answering a number of questions during the election campaign .
asked about her views on john mccain and barack obama in the last presidential debate , the fake mrs palin says of mr obama : " his words are smooth when he 's talking , he 's like an angel whispering in your ear .
he makes john mccain sound like a garbage truck unloading trash at a landfill . "
mrs palin , who has in the past said she loved tina fey 's impersonations , was first seen watching the show from the backstage with the show 's executive producer lorne michaels .
actor alec baldwin joins them , under the impression that mrs palin is tina fey .
" this is the most important election in our nation 's history and you want her , our tina , to go out there and stand with that horrible woman ? "
mr baldwin , a known left-winger , says to mr michaels .
told of his " mistake " , alec baldwin apologises .
but sarah palin retorts : " i must say , your brother stephen is my favourite baldwin brother . "
mrs palin then comes on stage to replace her mimic , who swiftly exits when she sees her .
" i 'm not going to take any of your questions , " she says .
" but i wanted to take this opportunity to say , " live from new york , it 's saturday night . "
dancing moose later in the show , mrs palin is seen bopping in her chair as cast member amy poehler raps a song which the vice-presidential candidate said would hurt her election campaign if she performed it herself .
fey 's looks , mannerisms and accent closely resemble palin 's during the song , eskimos , an impersonator of her husband todd and a large moose dance on stage .
at one point , mrs poehler shoots the moose who falls to the ground , a jibe at mrs palin 's passion for hunting and fondness for guns .
the bbc 's correspondent in washington , rajini vaidyanathan , says mrs palin 's performance on the show was in many ways what you would expect from a politician running for office .
the best and most risque gags were delivered by actors and snl cast members , rather than by sarah palin herself , she says .
our correspondent adds that mrs palin played the role of the comedy sidekick in the show , but did come across as someone who did not take herself too seriously and was happy to laugh at the jokes made at her expense .
fey 's spoof sarah palin has done wonders for saturday night live 's viewing figures .
ratings for the show have gone up , averaging 8.3 million viewers , and the sketches are drawing as many as 9.3 million hits online .
it is not clear whether republican presidential candidate john mccain watched the show , but earlier in the day said that he thought tina fey and his running mate were " separated at birth " .

lord mandelson on brown lord mandelson has dismissed as " muck raking " and " innuendo " stories about his links to a russian billionaire when he was eu trade commissioner .
the business secretary said there was " not one jot of truth " in claims there was a conflict of interest .
to do business with emerging economies you had to have contact with business and economic figures , he told the bbc .
he also said he wished he and gordon brown had not fallen out in 1994 , saying they had wasted energy and time .
lord mandelson , who returned to the cabinet for a third time in a surprise appointment earlier this month , has been a controversial figure .
i wish it could have been different peter mandelson harman rejects mandelson ' smears ' he resigned twice from cabinet posts - once over a loan from his ministerial colleague geoffrey robinson and once over allegations of misconduct over a passport application for the hinduja brothers , for which he was later cleared of any wrongdoing .
since his appointment there have been stories in some newspapers about his links with russian billionaire oleg deripaska .
the mail on sunday reported an italian tycoon diego della vale , who benefited from eu trade tariffs , had played host to mr mandelson several times .
on thursday the conservative mp hugo swire called for a commons debate on the " very serious nature of some of these allegations " .
but on bbc one 's andrew marr programme the business secretary dismissed the claims as " muck-raking stories that have appeared in some of the conservative newspapers " .
" i have a very clear view of my public role and the responsibilities i have in that public role and how i spend my private time , " he said .
" there has been innuendo in the newspapers that i gave favours or i gave benefits as trade commissioner to certain individuals because of my personal friendship with them .
" the entirety of the european commission , the director general for trade himself , has made clear there is not one jot of truth in that , that it is 100 % false . "
he added later : " you can not do business as a european trade commissioner in russia , india , china , south africa , brazil , all the big emerging economies of the world , without having contact with the big business and economic figures in those countries as well as the political figures . "
' not showy ' lord mandelson fell out with mr brown in the 1990s when he decided to back tony blair for the labour leadership .
asked about his relationship with mr brown , he said it had had its " rocky moments " .
he said : " i think both of us looking back would say we wasted a lot of the energy and time that we could otherwise have devoted to the success of the government by not repairing our relationship sooner . "
however , he said the rift had been repaired and it was time to " leave the past behind us " .
lord mandelson said voters were now looking at mr brown " afresh " because of the way he had handled the financial crisis , and were saying he was decisive and capable of bold measures .
" he 's not a showy person , he 's not an attention-seeking person , he 's not swinging around like a pendulum in the way that -lsb- conservative leader -rsb- david cameron is , " he added .
