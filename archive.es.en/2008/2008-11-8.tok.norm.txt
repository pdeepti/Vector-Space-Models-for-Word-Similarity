the former bayern munich and germany striker had only six goals at the same stage in the 1971-72 season . " at the moment everything is going well for me , " says ibisevic , who has five goals more than the next players on the list , artur wichniarek of arminia bielefeld and patrick helmes of bayer leverkusen . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic managed to stay in the country 's top flight when aachen were relegated it has n't always been that way for the 24-year-old , who , according to hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser , has " had to work hard for everything " and can be proud of his achievements . at the age of 16 , ibisevic 's family left bosnia and herzegovina for a new life in switzerland , but unable to obtain a permit to stay sought better fortunes in the united states . the youngster 's performances on the college fields soon attracted the attention of scouts , leading to a contract with french club paris st. germain .
after only a year he was on his way to dijon , and then in may 2006 found himself heading for germany and alemannia aachen . strong in the air , the forward managed six goals in 24 games at aachen , and former coach guido buchwald did his best to retain the player when hoffenheim made an approach after aachen were relegated from the top flight . but ibisevic had an option in his contract allowing him to leave , and hoffenheim were prepared to pay around 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- for the striker , much to buchwald 's chagrin . " he was a central player , " buchwald said .
" hoffenheim signed him up while claiming they have a youth concept .
that annoys me . " slow , friendly start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic lent a hand to senegalese demba ba when he arrived at hoffenheim initially , the going did n't go so smoothly at hoffenheim .
he was quickly confronted with two new rivals for a place in the forward line when the club signed the nigerian obasi and the senegalese ba . yet despite these men posing a direct threat to his success , ibisevic went out of his way to help the two africans settle into the side . " when demba came he did n't speak any german so i helped him with french and we have become really good friends , " he said . hoffenheim 's schindelmeiser praised ibisevic 's dedication to helping his teammates . " the way he behaved was great , " schindelmeiser said .
" it 's something i really appreciate . " window of hope although the goals now come fast and many for ibisevic , he hardly set the second division alight last season .
he scored just five goals in hoffenheim 's jump into the first division and prior to this season was by no means a certain starter . but with obasi absent from the team while on olympic duty for nigeria , ibisevic was given a crack up front . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick admits to being surprised at the player 's development since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has maintained a degree of modesty about his successes " if chinedu had been available i 'm not sure vedad would have got this chance , " he said . down to earth but the bosnian does n't seem to have gotten carried away by his current goal scoring success . he said having grown up while a civil war was raging in his homeland puts this type of achievement into perspective . " it makes you stronger and more grown up , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .

russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .

russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.11.2008 hans blix predicts less militaristic us under obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if obama keeps his campaing promises , there is much hope for change , blix said former un weapons inspector hans blix told deutsche welle that us president-elect barack obama 's comes as a huge relief to the rest of the world .
he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .

the former bayern munich and germany striker had only six goals at the same stage in the 1971-72 season . " at the moment everything is going well for me , " says ibisevic , who has five goals more than the next players on the list , artur wichniarek of arminia bielefeld and patrick helmes of bayer leverkusen . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic managed to stay in the country 's top flight when aachen were relegated it has n't always been that way for the 24-year-old , who , according to hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser , has " had to work hard for everything " and can be proud of his achievements . at the age of 16 , ibisevic 's family left bosnia and herzegovina for a new life in switzerland , but unable to obtain a permit to stay sought better fortunes in the united states . the youngster 's performances on the college fields soon attracted the attention of scouts , leading to a contract with french club paris st. germain .
after only a year he was on his way to dijon , and then in may 2006 found himself heading for germany and alemannia aachen . strong in the air , the forward managed six goals in 24 games at aachen , and former coach guido buchwald did his best to retain the player when hoffenheim made an approach after aachen were relegated from the top flight . but ibisevic had an option in his contract allowing him to leave , and hoffenheim were prepared to pay around 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- for the striker , much to buchwald 's chagrin . " he was a central player , " buchwald said .
" hoffenheim signed him up while claiming they have a youth concept .
that annoys me . " slow , friendly start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic lent a hand to senegalese demba ba when he arrived at hoffenheim initially , the going did n't go so smoothly at hoffenheim .
he was quickly confronted with two new rivals for a place in the forward line when the club signed the nigerian obasi and the senegalese ba . yet despite these men posing a direct threat to his success , ibisevic went out of his way to help the two africans settle into the side . " when demba came he did n't speak any german so i helped him with french and we have become really good friends , " he said . hoffenheim 's schindelmeiser praised ibisevic 's dedication to helping his teammates . " the way he behaved was great , " schindelmeiser said .
" it 's something i really appreciate . " window of hope although the goals now come fast and many for ibisevic , he hardly set the second division alight last season .
he scored just five goals in hoffenheim 's jump into the first division and prior to this season was by no means a certain starter . but with obasi absent from the team while on olympic duty for nigeria , ibisevic was given a crack up front . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick admits to being surprised at the player 's development since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has maintained a degree of modesty about his successes " if chinedu had been available i 'm not sure vedad would have got this chance , " he said . down to earth but the bosnian does n't seem to have gotten carried away by his current goal scoring success . he said having grown up while a civil war was raging in his homeland puts this type of achievement into perspective .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .
then i know exactly where i am . interview : cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2008 analysis : germans remain haunted by financial turmoil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' reasons to fear financial meltdown reach back decades when germans debate how to avoid a devastating financial crash , they are haunted as few other nations can be by memories of most of their money practically vanishing during the 20th century . the people of europe 's biggest economy are " risk averse " as a result of history , according to manfred schmidt , a political science professor at the university of heidelberg who has written extensively on german anxiety . in 1923 , the great inflation wiped out germans ' money for the first time .
in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.11.2008 hans blix predicts less militaristic us under obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if obama keeps his campaing promises , there is much hope for change , blix said former un weapons inspector hans blix told deutsche welle that us president-elect barack obama 's comes as a huge relief to the rest of the world .
he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .

meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , just before a protest rally . in the south of germany , other demonstrators flocked to railway tracks expected to be used by the freight train convoy when it arrived from a french waste-reprocessing plant at la hague on the atlantic coast . two men and a woman chained themselves to the rail track at the small border town of berg .
a police spokesman said it would be difficult to cut them free .
protesters said the train was waiting at lauterbourg on the french side of the border . police expect more protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waste was delayed as police had to remove protesters from the train tracks the anti-nuclear movement seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations and believes that waste transport and storage is unsafe .
police said they expected protesters to try to block the convoy route through germany . protests became violent in town of wendland in lower saxony on friday when some demonstrators threw bottles and firecrackers at the police and set fire to police barricades .
they also reportedly smashed the windows of a police car and punctured its tires . police , however , do n't expect the violence to continue . " we 're assuming that most of the local demonstrations will take place peacefully , " a spokesman said . germany is studying whether to use an old saltmine near the warehouse in gorleben as long-term storage for the waste . fuel from germany 's nuclear plants is routinely sent abroad for reprocessing .
it is then returned to the gorleben storage facility where german anti-nuclear protesters try to delay its arrival . the convoy saturday , carrying 17 tons of waste encapsulated in 100 tons of glass , was the 11th over the years to carry spent waste to the small town . some 16,000 german police were detailed to protect the convoy . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former bayern munich and germany striker had only six goals at the same stage in the 1971-72 season . " at the moment everything is going well for me , " says ibisevic , who has five goals more than the next players on the list , artur wichniarek of arminia bielefeld and patrick helmes of bayer leverkusen . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic managed to stay in the country 's top flight when aachen were relegated it has n't always been that way for the 24-year-old , who , according to hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser , has " had to work hard for everything " and can be proud of his achievements . at the age of 16 , ibisevic 's family left bosnia and herzegovina for a new life in switzerland , but unable to obtain a permit to stay sought better fortunes in the united states . the youngster 's performances on the college fields soon attracted the attention of scouts , leading to a contract with french club paris st. germain .
after only a year he was on his way to dijon , and then in may 2006 found himself heading for germany and alemannia aachen . strong in the air , the forward managed six goals in 24 games at aachen , and former coach guido buchwald did his best to retain the player when hoffenheim made an approach after aachen were relegated from the top flight . but ibisevic had an option in his contract allowing him to leave , and hoffenheim were prepared to pay around 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- for the striker , much to buchwald 's chagrin . " he was a central player , " buchwald said .
" hoffenheim signed him up while claiming they have a youth concept .
that annoys me . " slow , friendly start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic lent a hand to senegalese demba ba when he arrived at hoffenheim initially , the going did n't go so smoothly at hoffenheim .
he was quickly confronted with two new rivals for a place in the forward line when the club signed the nigerian obasi and the senegalese ba . yet despite these men posing a direct threat to his success , ibisevic went out of his way to help the two africans settle into the side . " when demba came he did n't speak any german so i helped him with french and we have become really good friends , " he said . hoffenheim 's schindelmeiser praised ibisevic 's dedication to helping his teammates . " the way he behaved was great , " schindelmeiser said .
" it 's something i really appreciate . " window of hope although the goals now come fast and many for ibisevic , he hardly set the second division alight last season .
he scored just five goals in hoffenheim 's jump into the first division and prior to this season was by no means a certain starter . but with obasi absent from the team while on olympic duty for nigeria , ibisevic was given a crack up front . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick admits to being surprised at the player 's development since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has maintained a degree of modesty about his successes " if chinedu had been available i 'm not sure vedad would have got this chance , " he said . down to earth but the bosnian does n't seem to have gotten carried away by his current goal scoring success . he said having grown up while a civil war was raging in his homeland puts this type of achievement into perspective .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2008 remembering the night of broken glass großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pogrom got its name from the shattered glass from the windows of jewish shops november 9 marks the 70th anniversary of the pogrom against german jews known as kristallnacht .
dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .

sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .

" we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , just before a protest rally . in the south of germany , other demonstrators flocked to railway tracks expected to be used by the freight train convoy when it arrived from a french waste-reprocessing plant at la hague on the atlantic coast . two men and a woman chained themselves to the rail track at the small border town of berg .
a police spokesman said it would be difficult to cut them free .
protesters said the train was waiting at lauterbourg on the french side of the border . police expect more protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the waste was delayed as police had to remove protesters from the train tracks the anti-nuclear movement seeks the immediate closure of all nuclear power stations and believes that waste transport and storage is unsafe .
police said they expected protesters to try to block the convoy route through germany . protests became violent in town of wendland in lower saxony on friday when some demonstrators threw bottles and firecrackers at the police and set fire to police barricades .
they also reportedly smashed the windows of a police car and punctured its tires . police , however , do n't expect the violence to continue . " we 're assuming that most of the local demonstrations will take place peacefully , " a spokesman said . germany is studying whether to use an old saltmine near the warehouse in gorleben as long-term storage for the waste . fuel from germany 's nuclear plants is routinely sent abroad for reprocessing .
it is then returned to the gorleben storage facility where german anti-nuclear protesters try to delay its arrival . the convoy saturday , carrying 17 tons of waste encapsulated in 100 tons of glass , was the 11th over the years to carry spent waste to the small town . some 16,000 german police were detailed to protect the convoy . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 08.11.2008 russia 's rich still splashing out despite financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's wealthy wo n't let those pesky markets and bankruptcies spoil their caviar the financial crisis is hitting russian oligarchs hard too , but there 's no sign of them tightening their belts .
russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .
having put plenty of money aside during better days , for the oligarchs the economic downturn may be an inconvenience but it 's not really a crisis . dw staff -lrb- erik albrecht -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .

and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .

now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .

the former bayern munich and germany striker had only six goals at the same stage in the 1971-72 season . " at the moment everything is going well for me , " says ibisevic , who has five goals more than the next players on the list , artur wichniarek of arminia bielefeld and patrick helmes of bayer leverkusen . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic managed to stay in the country 's top flight when aachen were relegated it has n't always been that way for the 24-year-old , who , according to hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser , has " had to work hard for everything " and can be proud of his achievements . at the age of 16 , ibisevic 's family left bosnia and herzegovina for a new life in switzerland , but unable to obtain a permit to stay sought better fortunes in the united states . the youngster 's performances on the college fields soon attracted the attention of scouts , leading to a contract with french club paris st. germain .
after only a year he was on his way to dijon , and then in may 2006 found himself heading for germany and alemannia aachen . strong in the air , the forward managed six goals in 24 games at aachen , and former coach guido buchwald did his best to retain the player when hoffenheim made an approach after aachen were relegated from the top flight . but ibisevic had an option in his contract allowing him to leave , and hoffenheim were prepared to pay around 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- for the striker , much to buchwald 's chagrin . " he was a central player , " buchwald said .
" hoffenheim signed him up while claiming they have a youth concept .
that annoys me . " slow , friendly start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic lent a hand to senegalese demba ba when he arrived at hoffenheim initially , the going did n't go so smoothly at hoffenheim .
he was quickly confronted with two new rivals for a place in the forward line when the club signed the nigerian obasi and the senegalese ba . yet despite these men posing a direct threat to his success , ibisevic went out of his way to help the two africans settle into the side . " when demba came he did n't speak any german so i helped him with french and we have become really good friends , " he said . hoffenheim 's schindelmeiser praised ibisevic 's dedication to helping his teammates . " the way he behaved was great , " schindelmeiser said .
" it 's something i really appreciate . " window of hope although the goals now come fast and many for ibisevic , he hardly set the second division alight last season .
he scored just five goals in hoffenheim 's jump into the first division and prior to this season was by no means a certain starter . but with obasi absent from the team while on olympic duty for nigeria , ibisevic was given a crack up front . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick admits to being surprised at the player 's development since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has maintained a degree of modesty about his successes " if chinedu had been available i 'm not sure vedad would have got this chance , " he said . down to earth but the bosnian does n't seem to have gotten carried away by his current goal scoring success . he said having grown up while a civil war was raging in his homeland puts this type of achievement into perspective .

russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .
having put plenty of money aside during better days , for the oligarchs the economic downturn may be an inconvenience but it 's not really a crisis . dw staff -lrb- erik albrecht -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former bayern munich and germany striker had only six goals at the same stage in the 1971-72 season . " at the moment everything is going well for me , " says ibisevic , who has five goals more than the next players on the list , artur wichniarek of arminia bielefeld and patrick helmes of bayer leverkusen . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic managed to stay in the country 's top flight when aachen were relegated it has n't always been that way for the 24-year-old , who , according to hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser , has " had to work hard for everything " and can be proud of his achievements . at the age of 16 , ibisevic 's family left bosnia and herzegovina for a new life in switzerland , but unable to obtain a permit to stay sought better fortunes in the united states . the youngster 's performances on the college fields soon attracted the attention of scouts , leading to a contract with french club paris st. germain .
after only a year he was on his way to dijon , and then in may 2006 found himself heading for germany and alemannia aachen . strong in the air , the forward managed six goals in 24 games at aachen , and former coach guido buchwald did his best to retain the player when hoffenheim made an approach after aachen were relegated from the top flight . but ibisevic had an option in his contract allowing him to leave , and hoffenheim were prepared to pay around 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- for the striker , much to buchwald 's chagrin . " he was a central player , " buchwald said .
" hoffenheim signed him up while claiming they have a youth concept .
that annoys me . " slow , friendly start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic lent a hand to senegalese demba ba when he arrived at hoffenheim initially , the going did n't go so smoothly at hoffenheim .
he was quickly confronted with two new rivals for a place in the forward line when the club signed the nigerian obasi and the senegalese ba . yet despite these men posing a direct threat to his success , ibisevic went out of his way to help the two africans settle into the side . " when demba came he did n't speak any german so i helped him with french and we have become really good friends , " he said . hoffenheim 's schindelmeiser praised ibisevic 's dedication to helping his teammates . " the way he behaved was great , " schindelmeiser said .
" it 's something i really appreciate . " window of hope although the goals now come fast and many for ibisevic , he hardly set the second division alight last season .
he scored just five goals in hoffenheim 's jump into the first division and prior to this season was by no means a certain starter . but with obasi absent from the team while on olympic duty for nigeria , ibisevic was given a crack up front . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick admits to being surprised at the player 's development since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has maintained a degree of modesty about his successes " if chinedu had been available i 'm not sure vedad would have got this chance , " he said . down to earth but the bosnian does n't seem to have gotten carried away by his current goal scoring success . he said having grown up while a civil war was raging in his homeland puts this type of achievement into perspective . " it makes you stronger and more grown up , " he said .

a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2008 analysis : germans remain haunted by financial turmoil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' reasons to fear financial meltdown reach back decades when germans debate how to avoid a devastating financial crash , they are haunted as few other nations can be by memories of most of their money practically vanishing during the 20th century . the people of europe 's biggest economy are " risk averse " as a result of history , according to manfred schmidt , a political science professor at the university of heidelberg who has written extensively on german anxiety . in 1923 , the great inflation wiped out germans ' money for the first time .
in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.11.2008 analysis : germans remain haunted by financial turmoil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' reasons to fear financial meltdown reach back decades when germans debate how to avoid a devastating financial crash , they are haunted as few other nations can be by memories of most of their money practically vanishing during the 20th century . the people of europe 's biggest economy are " risk averse " as a result of history , according to manfred schmidt , a political science professor at the university of heidelberg who has written extensively on german anxiety . in 1923 , the great inflation wiped out germans ' money for the first time .
in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 08.11.2008 russia 's rich still splashing out despite financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's wealthy wo n't let those pesky markets and bankruptcies spoil their caviar the financial crisis is hitting russian oligarchs hard too , but there 's no sign of them tightening their belts .
russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .
having put plenty of money aside during better days , for the oligarchs the economic downturn may be an inconvenience but it 's not really a crisis . dw staff -lrb- erik albrecht -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .
then i know exactly where i am . interview : cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 08.11.2008 hans blix predicts less militaristic us under obama großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if obama keeps his campaing promises , there is much hope for change , blix said former un weapons inspector hans blix told deutsche welle that us president-elect barack obama 's comes as a huge relief to the rest of the world .
he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .
then i know exactly where i am . interview : cornelia rabitz -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with charlotte knobloch , head of the central council of jews in germany , about her memories from that night . deutsche welle : ms. knobloch , you were a child at the time of kristallnacht , or the night of broken glass .
what memories do you have of this day ? charlotte knobloch : my memory of this day is walking through munich holding my father 's hand .
we 'd been warned that something was going to happen to the jews and that it was better to be out on the street instead of at home .
we left our apartment and began walking in the direction of my father 's office .
he was a lawyer in munich and he called his own office from a phone booth .
a male voice came on the line and my father passed himself off as a client .
he was told , " he 's not here , we 're waiting for him . "
and from that , he knew what was up - they were already waiting for him in his office .
we continued on our way along herzog-rudolf-strasse .
it was cordoned off , but i remember - and this has always stayed in my memory - seeing the smoking synagogue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knobloch is the first female president of the central council of jews in germany my father wanted to go to a good friend of his - a man i knew as uncle rothschild .
as we arrived , we saw a car parked outside his door .
he came out of the house escorted by two people , and he had a bandage on his head .
you could still see the blood .
they led him to the car and immediately , he looked away from us .
he did n't want us to be recognized .
they were rough with him , kicking him into the car .
my father went to a phone booth and called another good friend who lived outside munich , and asked him if he could spend the night there .
so we walked there ; it took about two hours .
we constantly had to veer off the main road because of the police patrols . how important is it to you today that younger generations remember what happened on nov .
9 , 1938 ? you have to be very clear about these things .
it was 70 years ago .
and it 's the last opportunity we have to talk with eye witnesses about that day .
we should make sure that young people today do n't just take on the responsibility of remembrance on this , the 70th anniversary , but also on every anniversary that follows . for over two years now , you 've been president of the central council of jews in germany , and therefore the highest representative of around 110,000 jews .
what 's the appeal , and what are the burdens of this office ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the synagogue on berlin 's rykestrasse street reopened in 2007 after two years of renovation it 's neither appealing nor a burden .
i 'm happy that i get to experience - because of my biography - that jewish life has been resurrected here , and that jewish life continues to develop . this coexistence has , for many years now in the jewish community , been influenced by the considerable migration of people from the former soviet union - a gain for the communities but surely also a challenge .
has this challenge been handled well in your view ? it 's a challenge that should be further intensified .
we now have to deal with migrants who , because of being jewish , were exposed to much anti-semitism in the former soviet union , but who actually have no idea about judaism , because the religion was banned there .
these people are now being integrated in jewish life and the jewish religion , but also in public life in this country and its customs and values .
if we had n't had this migration , then we would n't have the joy in seeing the new buildings going up weekly , monthly in germany - and which make jewish life here so beautiful once again . you 've warned of a latent , poorly disguised or even open anti-semitism in germany .
how have you determined that enmity against jews has n't been overcome here ? well , there are the cliches and stereotypes that i hear over and over .
sometimes it 's direct , and sometimes it takes a more vague form .
it 's also the topic of israel .
in that moment where people here compare israelis or the israeli government with hitler and the nazis - that for me is a clear , anti-semitic statement .
i 've always said and i 'll say it again : of course you can criticize the country or its government .
i think constructive , factual criticism is always good , criticism can be helpful .
but anti-semitism , and this latent anti-semitism with the stereotypes and cliches , is already there when i 'm asked by young people whether jews even have to pay taxes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .

in 1948 , most savings vanished at the stroke of a pen when the old currency was demonetized .
in 1990 , it was the turn of east germans to lose half the value of larger savings . in the last few weeks , berlin has moved to guarantee personal savings at banks , guarantee interbank lending , and prop up the shakiest banks . even so , the world crisis has not yet caused spikes in bankruptcies or joblessness among ordinary germans . low real estate prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoiding a real estate bubble helped germany avoid some of the crisis a key reason for that has been absence of any real estate bubble like those in spain , britain and the united states . finance minister peer steinbrueck told the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , this month that the situation in germany has been just the opposite .
real estate prices in the past decade had been low compared to earlier times . " the second point , which plays a big role , is that we have a savings rate in germany of 10 to 11 percent , " he said , unlike the united states with a negative savings rate of minus 0.5 percent , requiring it to suck in other nations ' surplus cash . " we have also not had a credit crunch in recent weeks and months , " steinbrueck added , though business did face higher interest charges . german stocks have tanked , but according to a recent poll , only one in five germans feels personally concerned by the current financial crisis and the vast majority continues to trust their banks . in a survey of more than 1,000 people , the gfk research institute found that even among those who had invested in financial markets , the rate increased only to 30 percent , and thus remained in the " moderate " range . faith in the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government came to germans aid in the recent crisis political science professor schmidt said it was characteristic of germans , when compared to english-speaking nations , that they have " a particularly high expectation that the government will do something " to solve the problem . tracing germans ' need for security to the great inflation of 1923 and the currency re-issue of 1948 , he said germans do not want to lose hard-earned savings ever again . " it was a traumatic experience for the entire nation , " he said . herbert partuschke , 90 , a retired hamburg engineer , recalled this week how nine-tenths of the value of personal savings were simply lopped off bank accounts in 1948 when the new currency , the deutschmark , was introduced to cure a massive monetary overhang . " everybody knew that something had to be done , " he said .
" it threw us back , but everybody was more or less equally affected . " schmidt said the deletion of savings was the moment when germans were taxed with the cost of waging world war two . euro success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entering the euro zone has helped germany 's export sector cut costs the new currency , which has since been replaced by the euro -lrb- without any loss of savings -rrb- , proved a success for germany , and in the decades since , germans have saved hard and most still prefer solid , safe investments with modest rates of return . detlev liepmann , a psychology professor at the free university of berlin , said it was a wider characteristic of continental europeans like the germans and french that they were not used to living on credit , as many british and us citizens had done . liepmann , who specializes in economic and social issues in psychology , also observed that germans tended to be easier to calm . " the germans expect the state to intervene , and the state soothes them , " he said in an interview . recent polls suggest that germans have largely welcomed action by their government , including 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 605 billion -rrb- in funding to rescue banks .
the legislation was passed with little criticism by opposition parties . chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats saw their support rise from 35 percent to 37 percent as the crisis unfolded , forsa pollsters said last week . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .

“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 08.11.2008 russia 's rich still splashing out despite financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's wealthy wo n't let those pesky markets and bankruptcies spoil their caviar the financial crisis is hitting russian oligarchs hard too , but there 's no sign of them tightening their belts .
russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .

only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .
having put plenty of money aside during better days , for the oligarchs the economic downturn may be an inconvenience but it 's not really a crisis . dw staff -lrb- erik albrecht -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 even as hamas announced it would not take part in palestinian unity talks next week , a third voyage of eu lawmakers , activists and journalists challenged israel 's blockage of the gaza strip . egypt intends to inform palestinian factions of a plan to postpone reconciliation talks scheduled for this week in cairo , senior palestinian officials said saturday , nov .
8 , in the west bank and egypt , according to news agency reports on saturday . " egyptian authorities will inform all factions the national dialogue is postponed , " one official in the west bank told reuters news agency . no further date has been set for the talks that had been intended to heal a rift between palestinian president mahmoud abbas 's fatah faction and islamist hamas , a feud that erupted into violence last year when hamas seized power in gaza . the announcement came shortly after a ship with eu lawmakers , activists and journalists aboard docked in a gaza fishing port with a handful of hamas officials and dozens of palestinians on hand to welcome the delegation saturday morning . the yacht , which set sail friday from cyprus , carried 11 journalists , human rights and peace activists in addition to 12 european parliamentarians who egypt barred from traveling to gaza through its territories last month . hamas authorities arranged a three-day program for the delegation to inspect the effects of the israeli closure , especially on the healthcare system . easier than pervious trips nasser al-badri , a london-based reporter for the qatari satellite channel al-jazeera , said dignity 's third trip " was easier than the previous two voyages . "
he added that it is also more important " since it carries parliamentarians whose governments boycott hamas and its government . " the delegation is headed by nazir ahmed , a labour member of the house of lords in the uk .
most of the parliamentarians came from the uk and the remaining represented italy , switzerland and ireland . " even prisoners have rights , rights to have food and medicine and to live in dignity , " lord nazir ahmad , labour member of britain 's house of lords and head of the delegation , told the afp news agency .
" people here in gaza do n't have those rights . " also among the passengers is sami al-haj , an al-jazeera cameraman who spent five years in the us military prison in guantanamo , and clare short , former british minister of international development . the israeli navy allowed the ship to enter gaza territorial waters as it has done with the previous voyage .
israel imposed a tight sea blockade on gaza and does n't allow palestinian fishermen to work beyond tow nautical miles .
the voyage is chartered by the us-based free gaza movement which promotes against the israeli sanctions on gaza strip .
the movement ferried its first mission , which was made up of tow boats , in august and the second cruise in october . israel sealed off the gaza strip when the islamic hamas movement seized the salient in june 2007 .

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .

" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .
having put plenty of money aside during better days , for the oligarchs the economic downturn may be an inconvenience but it 's not really a crisis . dw staff -lrb- erik albrecht -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former bayern munich and germany striker had only six goals at the same stage in the 1971-72 season . " at the moment everything is going well for me , " says ibisevic , who has five goals more than the next players on the list , artur wichniarek of arminia bielefeld and patrick helmes of bayer leverkusen . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic managed to stay in the country 's top flight when aachen were relegated it has n't always been that way for the 24-year-old , who , according to hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser , has " had to work hard for everything " and can be proud of his achievements . at the age of 16 , ibisevic 's family left bosnia and herzegovina for a new life in switzerland , but unable to obtain a permit to stay sought better fortunes in the united states . the youngster 's performances on the college fields soon attracted the attention of scouts , leading to a contract with french club paris st. germain .
after only a year he was on his way to dijon , and then in may 2006 found himself heading for germany and alemannia aachen . strong in the air , the forward managed six goals in 24 games at aachen , and former coach guido buchwald did his best to retain the player when hoffenheim made an approach after aachen were relegated from the top flight . but ibisevic had an option in his contract allowing him to leave , and hoffenheim were prepared to pay around 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- for the striker , much to buchwald 's chagrin . " he was a central player , " buchwald said .
" hoffenheim signed him up while claiming they have a youth concept .
that annoys me . " slow , friendly start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic lent a hand to senegalese demba ba when he arrived at hoffenheim initially , the going did n't go so smoothly at hoffenheim .
he was quickly confronted with two new rivals for a place in the forward line when the club signed the nigerian obasi and the senegalese ba . yet despite these men posing a direct threat to his success , ibisevic went out of his way to help the two africans settle into the side . " when demba came he did n't speak any german so i helped him with french and we have become really good friends , " he said . hoffenheim 's schindelmeiser praised ibisevic 's dedication to helping his teammates . " the way he behaved was great , " schindelmeiser said .
" it 's something i really appreciate . " window of hope although the goals now come fast and many for ibisevic , he hardly set the second division alight last season .
he scored just five goals in hoffenheim 's jump into the first division and prior to this season was by no means a certain starter . but with obasi absent from the team while on olympic duty for nigeria , ibisevic was given a crack up front . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick admits to being surprised at the player 's development since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has maintained a degree of modesty about his successes " if chinedu had been available i 'm not sure vedad would have got this chance , " he said . down to earth but the bosnian does n't seem to have gotten carried away by his current goal scoring success . he said having grown up while a civil war was raging in his homeland puts this type of achievement into perspective . " it makes you stronger and more grown up , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , just before a protest rally . in the south of germany , other demonstrators flocked to railway tracks expected to be used by the freight train convoy when it arrived from a french waste-reprocessing plant at la hague on the atlantic coast . two men and a woman chained themselves to the rail track at the small border town of berg .
a police spokesman said it would be difficult to cut them free .

they also reportedly smashed the windows of a police car and punctured its tires . police , however , do n't expect the violence to continue . " we 're assuming that most of the local demonstrations will take place peacefully , " a spokesman said . germany is studying whether to use an old saltmine near the warehouse in gorleben as long-term storage for the waste . fuel from germany 's nuclear plants is routinely sent abroad for reprocessing .
it is then returned to the gorleben storage facility where german anti-nuclear protesters try to delay its arrival . the convoy saturday , carrying 17 tons of waste encapsulated in 100 tons of glass , was the 11th over the years to carry spent waste to the small town . some 16,000 german police were detailed to protect the convoy . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 even as hamas announced it would not take part in palestinian unity talks next week , a third voyage of eu lawmakers , activists and journalists challenged israel 's blockage of the gaza strip . egypt intends to inform palestinian factions of a plan to postpone reconciliation talks scheduled for this week in cairo , senior palestinian officials said saturday , nov .
8 , in the west bank and egypt , according to news agency reports on saturday . " egyptian authorities will inform all factions the national dialogue is postponed , " one official in the west bank told reuters news agency . no further date has been set for the talks that had been intended to heal a rift between palestinian president mahmoud abbas 's fatah faction and islamist hamas , a feud that erupted into violence last year when hamas seized power in gaza . the announcement came shortly after a ship with eu lawmakers , activists and journalists aboard docked in a gaza fishing port with a handful of hamas officials and dozens of palestinians on hand to welcome the delegation saturday morning . the yacht , which set sail friday from cyprus , carried 11 journalists , human rights and peace activists in addition to 12 european parliamentarians who egypt barred from traveling to gaza through its territories last month . hamas authorities arranged a three-day program for the delegation to inspect the effects of the israeli closure , especially on the healthcare system . easier than pervious trips nasser al-badri , a london-based reporter for the qatari satellite channel al-jazeera , said dignity 's third trip " was easier than the previous two voyages . "
he added that it is also more important " since it carries parliamentarians whose governments boycott hamas and its government . " the delegation is headed by nazir ahmed , a labour member of the house of lords in the uk .
most of the parliamentarians came from the uk and the remaining represented italy , switzerland and ireland . " even prisoners have rights , rights to have food and medicine and to live in dignity , " lord nazir ahmad , labour member of britain 's house of lords and head of the delegation , told the afp news agency .
" people here in gaza do n't have those rights . " also among the passengers is sami al-haj , an al-jazeera cameraman who spent five years in the us military prison in guantanamo , and clare short , former british minister of international development . the israeli navy allowed the ship to enter gaza territorial waters as it has done with the previous voyage .
israel imposed a tight sea blockade on gaza and does n't allow palestinian fishermen to work beyond tow nautical miles .
the voyage is chartered by the us-based free gaza movement which promotes against the israeli sanctions on gaza strip .
the movement ferried its first mission , which was made up of tow boats , in august and the second cruise in october . israel sealed off the gaza strip when the islamic hamas movement seized the salient in june 2007 .

a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .

becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .

the former bayern munich and germany striker had only six goals at the same stage in the 1971-72 season . " at the moment everything is going well for me , " says ibisevic , who has five goals more than the next players on the list , artur wichniarek of arminia bielefeld and patrick helmes of bayer leverkusen . ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic managed to stay in the country 's top flight when aachen were relegated it has n't always been that way for the 24-year-old , who , according to hoffenheim general manager jan schindelmeiser , has " had to work hard for everything " and can be proud of his achievements . at the age of 16 , ibisevic 's family left bosnia and herzegovina for a new life in switzerland , but unable to obtain a permit to stay sought better fortunes in the united states . the youngster 's performances on the college fields soon attracted the attention of scouts , leading to a contract with french club paris st. germain .
after only a year he was on his way to dijon , and then in may 2006 found himself heading for germany and alemannia aachen . strong in the air , the forward managed six goals in 24 games at aachen , and former coach guido buchwald did his best to retain the player when hoffenheim made an approach after aachen were relegated from the top flight . but ibisevic had an option in his contract allowing him to leave , and hoffenheim were prepared to pay around 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- for the striker , much to buchwald 's chagrin . " he was a central player , " buchwald said .
" hoffenheim signed him up while claiming they have a youth concept .
that annoys me . " slow , friendly start bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic lent a hand to senegalese demba ba when he arrived at hoffenheim initially , the going did n't go so smoothly at hoffenheim .
he was quickly confronted with two new rivals for a place in the forward line when the club signed the nigerian obasi and the senegalese ba . yet despite these men posing a direct threat to his success , ibisevic went out of his way to help the two africans settle into the side . " when demba came he did n't speak any german so i helped him with french and we have become really good friends , " he said . hoffenheim 's schindelmeiser praised ibisevic 's dedication to helping his teammates . " the way he behaved was great , " schindelmeiser said .
" it 's something i really appreciate . " window of hope although the goals now come fast and many for ibisevic , he hardly set the second division alight last season .
he scored just five goals in hoffenheim 's jump into the first division and prior to this season was by no means a certain starter . but with obasi absent from the team while on olympic duty for nigeria , ibisevic was given a crack up front . hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick admits to being surprised at the player 's development since then . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibisevic has maintained a degree of modesty about his successes " if chinedu had been available i 'm not sure vedad would have got this chance , " he said . down to earth but the bosnian does n't seem to have gotten carried away by his current goal scoring success . he said having grown up while a civil war was raging in his homeland puts this type of achievement into perspective .

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .

obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .
the russians have some reason to be offended . does obama have a chance to negotiate skillfully and , above all , peacefully ? for me , the most courage that obama shows is through the nuclear disarmament that he has called for .
the cold war is over and there is no reason in the world why we need nuclear weapons .
of course it is very utopian-like to believe that all atom bombs will be disposed of immediately .
but first steps should be taken in this direction .
obama supports this very strongly .
he wants to reduce missile production .
i have great hope for this .
and the us could save a lot of money by doing this too .
the world spends 1.3 billion euros per year on military equipment .
half of this , almost 700 million euros , is funded by the us .
obama and his new government could save a fair amount of money , which they could surely better use for other projects . interview : anna kuhn-osius -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 08.11.2008 russia 's rich still splashing out despite financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's wealthy wo n't let those pesky markets and bankruptcies spoil their caviar the financial crisis is hitting russian oligarchs hard too , but there 's no sign of them tightening their belts .
russia 's rich are still digging deep into their pockets , especially when it comes to having fun . “ the most ” , moscow 's exclusive night spot for the renowned , the rich and the even richer offers its patrons a luxurious distraction from the stock markets , even - or perhaps especially - during this global economic downturn .
russia 's super-rich have lost an estimated 230 billion us dollars as a result of the financial turbulence , but that 's not dampened the atmosphere at “ the most ” .
instead the party-goers dance the night away , illuminated by giant crystal chandeliers with a value of over a million dollars .
“ the most ” even held what it termed an ‘ anti-crisis party ' recently , serving as an extravagant homage to the bankrupt us investment bank lehman brothers .
“ lots of investment bankers came along , ” club owner sergej paramonov told deutsche welle .
“ despite the huge losses and the insolvency they appreciated the humor and the sense of irony with which we tackled the problems in the world economy . ”
no signs of panic anna barinowa , the editor of the russian magazine madame figaro does n't expect the oligarchs to curb their spending .
she still intends to focus on luxury products with price tags that would make most people weep .
barinowa is convinced that the russian super-rich are still shopping , and to support her argument she points to the stable sales figures for luxury car makers like bentley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wheels may be coming off the markets , but not for bentley 's russia sales there are few signs of panic amongst wealthy russians , who are not strangers to financial turbulence .
the rubel crisis in 1998 showed them that even the sharpest dips in fortunes are usually followed by an upswing .
barinowa says many of the oligarchs see this downturn as the financial system balancing itself out , and know that they personally can weather virtually any storm .
“ the middle classes are being hit hardest of all , but at the top they 'll keep on consuming their luxury products , ” barinowa said . she even expects the desires and the standards of the super rich to increase in the coming years - if you 're spending frivolously in a recession , then you at least demand quality for the money .
status symbols instead of stocks and shares bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : extravagant fashion items still get russians spending top designer helen yarmak tries to offer these high quality products , the sable furs she sells are all unique .
only the world 's richest people are familiar with yarmak 's boutiques in moscow , new york and milan .
janet jackson and melanie griffith are amongst the most famous customers , and business is booming , even now .
the designer is convinced that the financial downturn is good news for her business .
people are turning to status symbols like her furs because the values of these real , tangible products are not decided on a stock market floor .
“ people who invested their money in shares rather than in one of my furs are regretting it a lot now , and they are looking to make amends , ” yarmak said .
even though the markets are nose-diving and the oil prices are dropping , russia 's super rich are still living the high life .
having put plenty of money aside during better days , for the oligarchs the economic downturn may be an inconvenience but it 's not really a crisis . dw staff -lrb- erik albrecht -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.11.2008 expert : germany should step in to solve conflict in the congo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting in eastern congo has displaced thosands of people eu foreign ministers will meet to discuss sending troops to resolve the conflict in the congo .
ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his visit will mark the first of a german minister to iraq since 2003 and an upturn in trans-atlantic ties . the visit is intended to send a signal to washington that president-elect barack obama 's middle east policies may get more support in berlin than those of current us president george w. bush , german media reported saturday , nov .
8 . the trip is still in the early planning stages and no concrete date has been set , according to a foreign ministry spokesman . germany and the united states have not seen eye-to-eye on the us war in iraq ever since it began in 2003 .
steinmeier served as chief of staff to former chancellor gerhard schroeder , who won re-election largely because of his opposition to the war . restarting trans-atlantic relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu and usa move in the same direction under obama ?
steinmeier said that germany was looking forward to improving trans-atlantic relations with obama .

the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 even as hamas announced it would not take part in palestinian unity talks next week , a third voyage of eu lawmakers , activists and journalists challenged israel 's blockage of the gaza strip . egypt intends to inform palestinian factions of a plan to postpone reconciliation talks scheduled for this week in cairo , senior palestinian officials said saturday , nov .
8 , in the west bank and egypt , according to news agency reports on saturday . " egyptian authorities will inform all factions the national dialogue is postponed , " one official in the west bank told reuters news agency . no further date has been set for the talks that had been intended to heal a rift between palestinian president mahmoud abbas 's fatah faction and islamist hamas , a feud that erupted into violence last year when hamas seized power in gaza . the announcement came shortly after a ship with eu lawmakers , activists and journalists aboard docked in a gaza fishing port with a handful of hamas officials and dozens of palestinians on hand to welcome the delegation saturday morning . the yacht , which set sail friday from cyprus , carried 11 journalists , human rights and peace activists in addition to 12 european parliamentarians who egypt barred from traveling to gaza through its territories last month . hamas authorities arranged a three-day program for the delegation to inspect the effects of the israeli closure , especially on the healthcare system . easier than pervious trips nasser al-badri , a london-based reporter for the qatari satellite channel al-jazeera , said dignity 's third trip " was easier than the previous two voyages . "
he added that it is also more important " since it carries parliamentarians whose governments boycott hamas and its government . " the delegation is headed by nazir ahmed , a labour member of the house of lords in the uk .
most of the parliamentarians came from the uk and the remaining represented italy , switzerland and ireland . " even prisoners have rights , rights to have food and medicine and to live in dignity , " lord nazir ahmad , labour member of britain 's house of lords and head of the delegation , told the afp news agency .
" people here in gaza do n't have those rights . " also among the passengers is sami al-haj , an al-jazeera cameraman who spent five years in the us military prison in guantanamo , and clare short , former british minister of international development . the israeli navy allowed the ship to enter gaza territorial waters as it has done with the previous voyage .
israel imposed a tight sea blockade on gaza and does n't allow palestinian fishermen to work beyond tow nautical miles .
the voyage is chartered by the us-based free gaza movement which promotes against the israeli sanctions on gaza strip .
the movement ferried its first mission , which was made up of tow boats , in august and the second cruise in october . israel sealed off the gaza strip when the islamic hamas movement seized the salient in june 2007 .
but human rights groups and the working un bodies in gaza say the poor , ordinary people pay the price of the sanctions . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .

8 , refused to return to germany dozens of paintings brought to the soviet union as a result of world war ii . officials from the simferopol art museum in south ukraine told germany 's foreign ministry the museum " had no plans to give up " the 87 paintings thought originally to have belonged to the suermondt- ludwig art museum in the german city aachen , a foreign ministry spokeswoman said .
a pair of bavarian tourists photographed the paintings during a 2007 visit to ukraine 's crimea province and sent copies of the shots to the aachen museum after finding the paintings listed as " whereabouts unknown " on the aachen museum web site .
the art works , reportedly mostly by western european artists , had been transferred from aachen to the german city of meissen for safekeeping in 1942 and had been thought to have been lost or destroyed during the later allied invasion of germany .
according to the tourist , one painting featured an image of the inner court of nuremberg 's st. lorenz church and a still-legible german inscription on the frame identifying the work as part of the aachen collection .
meissen was in the soviet zone of control during allied occupation of germany .
" it is explicit , here -lrb- in the simferopol museum -rrb- are on display 87 paintings from aachen 's suermondt-ludwig museum , " said philip becker , curator of the museum 's current " schattengalerie " exhibition .
disputed paintings at center of ownership row text descriptions accompanying the exhibition in ukraine gave the impression that the current ownership of the paintings had been resolved on the government level .
becker said he was surprised to find out about the location of the art works a year after the ukrainian exhibit began . " the most important this is to know where the paintings are , that they exist and that they are in good condition , " becker said .
simferopol 's spokeswoman told reporters the museum had no intention of returning the paintings .
the ukranian museum 's management reportedly justified its intention not to give up the paintings , citing a ukrainian law giving people or organizations having suffered property damage during the german invasion of the soviet union during wwii legal title to german property captured by red army troops in later stages of the war . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said he hopes other gulf states will help iraq when us troops pull out . hans blix became well known abroad for accusing us president george w. bush 's administration of exaggerating the threat of weapons of mass destruction in iraq in order to justify going to war against saddam hussein in 2003 .
blix formerly worked for the swedish minister for foreign affairs and also served as director of the international atomic energy agency . deutsche welle : what does barack obama 's win mean for world politics ? hans blix : i think politically speaking , the election means unbelievable relief for the world .
we had to deal with almost extremist and purely militaristic politics with the bush administration for such a long time .
bush had the habit of commanding people around rather than talking with them .
obama has already signaled that he wants to sit down with the world 's state and government leaders and really negotiate .
many people have accused obama of being naive .
but i see this as a big chance , especially now for countries like iran .
of course nobody knows if this will achieve anything . what do you think ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and biden have a series of foreign policy issues to confront in any case , we need to try .
it 's high time , since we have already lost so many years .
talking with the opponent does n't mean giving in to the opponent .
it simply means being able to better understand the opponent 's position .
and soon there will be elections in iran , and that could change some things . what about iraq ?
obama has criticized the war as the worst mistake that bush could have made ... obama is dead-on about that .
this war was in no way justifiable .
bush had three arguments for this war .
first : al-qaida was supposedly in iraq .
but al-qaida wan not there .
second : iraq had weapons of mass destruction .
but there were n't any there .
third : bush wanted to bring democracy to iraq .
but this failed too .
now at the end of his term , bush has given up and even agreed with obama 's request : american troops will be pulled out of iraq .
but mccain had even announced that he would leave troops in iraq for 100 years . obama wants to " remove the troops responsibly , " as he puts it .
wo n't iraq slip into chaos once the last soldiers leave ? the majority of iraq 's population wants the us to pull out , even when that means leaving the country to its own devices .
what is therefore important is strong cooperation with the other gulf states .
they can help to stabilize iraq .
this is the biggest hope that i have for this region . how do you rate russia 's behavior after obama 's win ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blix said russia needs to be taken seriously by the usa russia feels humiliated by the us .
that 's why -lsb- russian president dmitry -rsb- medvedev not only did n't congratulate obama on his victory but also why he directed missiles at europe .
russia wants , without a doubt , to be taken seriously .
unfortunately , through the bush era , we 've taken a step backwards in our relationship with russia , as though the cold war never ended .
the relationship between russia and the us was never easy , but it worsened dramatically under bush 's reign .
the missile defense system damaged the relationship , and entering the nato negotiations with georgia and ukraine almost destroyed it altogether .
it was simply too much for russia .
i put an emphasis on strengthened talks from obama with russia .
i hope he tries to understand the russians ' situation .
simply put , they do n't feel as though they are taken seriously by the us .
after the georgia crisis , almost all countries voiced criticism against russia , when it was the georgians that attacked .

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?
in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2005 the european union decided to start the eusec mission to improve the security sector in the congo , especially for the police and the national army .
now the national army is the most prolific violator of human rights in the congo so we need to talk about why we are spending so much money on these programs which really are n't that efficient .
there talking about nkunda 's troops killing people as well , so can we really just blame the government ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delius suggests germany use its relationship with rwanda no , we should n't blame just the government and we should n't blame just nkunda .
what we have seen is that over the past few weeks nearly 80 percent of all the human rights violations in the eastern congo were not committed by rebels , but rather by the regular congolese army .
just two days ago we got news about an incident where rebels murdered at least 12 civilians , and we have to criticize nkunda over these killings , that 's for sure .
however , when we discuss who is responsible for protecting human rights and the civilian populations on both sides we need to ask ourselves what is the congolese government doing to improve the human rights commitment of its own army and police force ?
and the answer is nothing .
there was talk a while back about the african union controlling a force or african countries sending troops into darfur , why is n't it that the eu is working closer with the au to try and solve this problem in the congo ? there are certainly many foreign ministries in the european union which might favor broader involvement of the african union in the congo conflict .
but on the other hand they 're also aware that the congo conflict is also an african conflict involving many countries , not just the congo and rwanda .
so many countries are involved militarily or politically in this struggle at the moment .
but it 's extremely difficult to get the african union involved as a neutral party , and right now only neutral parties can be effective .
regarding the inefficiency of the african union and its peace commitment in darfur , it 's really not a good idea to invite the au to be more involved in the congo because the congo conflict is much more complex and much more difficult to solve than the darfur conflict .
they are failing in darfur and they would be guaranteed to fail in the congo . interview : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ulrich delius , africa expert at the society for threatened peoples , told dw-world that diplomacy is better than deployment . dw-world : do you think it 's a good idea to send european union troops to africa to help with this conflict in the democratic republic of congo ?
ulrich delius : we think it is a very positive development that the british and french foreign secretaries traveled to the region and showed to all participants in this conflict , especially the governments of rwanda and the congo , that the eu has a vital interest in stabilizing peace in central africa .
i think , politically , that is a very important message .
another question is would it be helpful for the eu to send military support to monuc , the un mission , or to have a humanitarian mission of its own military forces .
this is a completely different point .
we are quite reluctant when it comes to such an involvement because we had to analyze it in a practical way .
who might be able to send these soldiers on a very urgent mission to central africa ?
it could only be france at the present time , and france has had an extremely difficult relationship with the rwandan government for a long time due to its implication in its involvement in the genocide in 1994 in rwanda .
so sending french soldiers on behalf of the european union would incite more problems than it would solve .
there are currently 17,000 un troops based in the congo , which is the largest peace keeping force in the world , despite the fact that the congo has a land area that is roughly the same size as western europe .
do we need new troops sent in and should they be un troops ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich delius certainly most experts think that we need new troops and there have been very concrete demands by the former monuc leader alan doss .
he presented a list of what he has been looking for months and months and nobody reacted .
they only reacted at the last moment when they saw the peace process was collapsing in central africa .
but i think it 's not only necessary to discuss new troops , but we also need to discuss the mandate of these troops and why these 17,000 un peace keepers are unable to protect the civilian population and preserve peace .
that 's a really important question and nobody on the un security council seems to be talking about this matter .
the eu foreign ministers will gather in brussels on monday , november 10 th .
if sending french troops is such a problem what could they do to battle that ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebel forces are being led by laurent nkunda that would certainly be a positive step to finance more involvement of foreign troops in a monuc mission .
to encourage an open debate in the security council about the mandate of these monuc troops and why they still have been unable to fulfill their mission .
and to encourage all of the conflict 's parties , especially the governments of the congo and rwanda and other african countries who have troops involved , to stick to this peace again there and to fulfill all the promises that were made during the peace conferences that have taken place over the last two years . which european governments are considered to be friendly towards the democratic republic of congo and why ca n't they send soldiers ?
it 's difficult to decide on a european level because we had this discussion in regard to sudan and the mission there before .
we heard about the difficulties of european countries to send any troops and have a larger involvement in the mission to africa .
most of this is due to technical problems .
many are heavily involved in iraq , afghanistan and other peace keeping missions in europe .
we had this discussion for many months in regard to sudan .
european countries have been unable to support the un there so why should we start this discussion about european involvement in the congo ?
let 's focus on more realistic points , specifically putting more pressure on the rwandan government .
many countries , especially germany , have a very positive and intensive relationship with rwanda .
so why are n't they using their influence on -lsb- rwandan president paul kagame -rsb- to push him to stop his support of general nkunda and why are n't they talking about the inefficiency of the european programs to stabilize the congo ?

an appeal involving rugby clubs across wales raised £ 200,000 for alterations to allow bryan davies , 50 , to live back with his family in bala , gwynedd .
he called going home to his wife and two children a shock , but " welsh fresh air " was already making a difference .
mr davies , known as yogi , was playing his final game for bala when the accident happened .
the fund-raising has ranged from events at rugby clubs across wales , to £ 10,000 from his former employers , ifor williams trailers in gwynedd . "
thank you seems so small , considering the things people have done for us " sue davies , brian davies 's wife " i 'd like to thank everybody who contributed to the fund , without them i 'd never be able to come home , " mr davies said .
" the welsh fresh air makes a big difference .
" it was a bit of a shock to come home , but hopefully now i can look forward to the future and get on with my life . "
mr davies ' wife sue said his homecoming had been " like all my christmases had come together " .
despite the " rollercoaster " over the past 18 months she said she was a " very determined person " and had promised to get her husband back to bala .
she said her husband had told her when he was first injured , and in intensive care , that she had permission to put him in a home .
" basically i said if you even say that again the broken neck will be the least of your worries . "
describing the moment her husband arrived home she added : " people kept asking me how i felt , and i did n't know how i felt .
" then i saw the van -lrb- bringing him home -rrb- turning from the main road and my heart went into a tizz . "
the money raised has been used to adapt the house with a new extension , special lift and equipment , and accommodation for the carers mr davies needs 24 hours a day .
" it has also widened doorways for access to the rest of the house , so it is still a family home , " said mrs davies .
of those who contributed she added : " i am so grateful to everyone .
" thank you seems so small , considering the things people have done for us . "
rhodri jones , the treasurer of bala rugby club , and member of the appeal committee said the support both locally and nationally throughout wales had been " phenomenal " .
" the money raised has surprised us and far exceeded what we expected , " he added .

the lga blamed the economic downturn for the increasing numbers turning to councils for help .
a spokesman warned of " meltdown " without additional government cash .
a government spokesman said councils could apply for a share of the £ 400m grant available for affordable housing schemes and social homes .
currently there are four million waiting for social housing .
by 2010 , it is expected to jump to five million , according to the lga .
paul bettison , from the lga , told the bbc that councils were finding it increasingly difficult to help those who requested assistance .
' meltdown ' the association said its members " desperately " needed an injection of cash from the government to pay for more properties .
mr bettison said : " it 's very serious now ; it 's critical now .
" if we do n't get additional funding from central government then i can see it reaching meltdown within a couple of years . "
local authorities in england have to give half the rent which they are paid by tenants to central government ; the money is then redistributed .
there are also very strict rules about how much councils can borrow to build new properties .
it has been also estimated that local authorities spend approximately £ 250m paying for people to stay in bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation .
these costs are also expected to go up .
gillian batten was so fed up with spending two years on the housing waiting list in lincolnshire that she eventually rented a home privately .
gillian batten is still on a council waiting list after two years but the mother-of-one said it is a luxury she can not afford .
describing the system as one that " stinks " , she said : " i 'm not the only one .
there are thousands out there that are in the same boat and it is quite frustrating . "
every month her local authority , south holland district council , receives up to 100 new applications for council houses but although it had been able to build new homes , it has found it difficult to keep up with demand .
the leader of the council , councillor gary porter , said : " the government needs to let us keep the rent we collect so that we could spend it on new homes .
this year have taken over £ 3.5m off us which would go a long way to cutting down the waiting lists .
david ireland , a spokesman for housing charity the empty homes agency , said the solution could lie behind boarded-up homes .
' ease pressure ' there are believed to be one million empty homes nationwide .
although most are privately-owned , 15 % are thought to belong to housing associations and councils .
mr ireland said councils could ease the pressure on housing by renting properties on short-term lets .
he claimed this was a far better option than placing people in bed and breakfasts .
we are constantly looking at what more we can to do to ensure stability and fairness in the market so we can deliver the homes future first-time buyers and families need department for communities and local government spokesman he said : " we have a recession , we have a housing market downturn , more houses are going to become empty that 's for sure .
" they need to have plans in place to help private owners to get properties back in use and for their own stock - they should n't be leaving properties like this empty " .
a spokesman for the department for communities and local government said : " we are focused on maintaining the delivery of affordable homes in this challenging climate and supporting industry so it is ready for the recovery .
he said that , as well as money for affordable housing schemes and social homes , the government was also helping provide more affordable homes by buying unsold properties on the open market .
" we are constantly looking at what more we can to do to ensure stability and fairness in the market so we can deliver the homes future first-time buyers and families need , " he said .

a government spokesman said councils could apply for a share of the £ 400m grant available for affordable housing schemes and social homes .
currently there are four million waiting for social housing .
by 2010 , it is expected to jump to five million , according to the lga .
paul bettison , from the lga , told the bbc that councils were finding it increasingly difficult to help those who requested assistance .
' meltdown ' the association said its members " desperately " needed an injection of cash from the government to pay for more properties .
mr bettison said : " it 's very serious now ; it 's critical now .
" if we do n't get additional funding from central government then i can see it reaching meltdown within a couple of years . "
local authorities in england have to give half the rent which they are paid by tenants to central government ; the money is then redistributed .

it has been also estimated that local authorities spend approximately £ 250m paying for people to stay in bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation .

the lga blamed the economic downturn for the increasing numbers turning to councils for help .
a spokesman warned of " meltdown " without additional government cash .
a government spokesman said councils could apply for a share of the £ 400m grant available for affordable housing schemes and social homes .
currently there are four million waiting for social housing .
by 2010 , it is expected to jump to five million , according to the lga .
paul bettison , from the lga , told the bbc that councils were finding it increasingly difficult to help those who requested assistance .
' meltdown ' the association said its members " desperately " needed an injection of cash from the government to pay for more properties .
mr bettison said : " it 's very serious now ; it 's critical now .
" if we do n't get additional funding from central government then i can see it reaching meltdown within a couple of years . "
local authorities in england have to give half the rent which they are paid by tenants to central government ; the money is then redistributed .
there are also very strict rules about how much councils can borrow to build new properties .
it has been also estimated that local authorities spend approximately £ 250m paying for people to stay in bed and breakfast and hostel accommodation .
these costs are also expected to go up .
gillian batten was so fed up with spending two years on the housing waiting list in lincolnshire that she eventually rented a home privately .
gillian batten is still on a council waiting list after two years but the mother-of-one said it is a luxury she can not afford .
describing the system as one that " stinks " , she said : " i 'm not the only one .
there are thousands out there that are in the same boat and it is quite frustrating . "
every month her local authority , south holland district council , receives up to 100 new applications for council houses but although it had been able to build new homes , it has found it difficult to keep up with demand .
the leader of the council , councillor gary porter , said : " the government needs to let us keep the rent we collect so that we could spend it on new homes .
this year have taken over £ 3.5m off us which would go a long way to cutting down the waiting lists .
david ireland , a spokesman for housing charity the empty homes agency , said the solution could lie behind boarded-up homes .
' ease pressure ' there are believed to be one million empty homes nationwide .
although most are privately-owned , 15 % are thought to belong to housing associations and councils .
mr ireland said councils could ease the pressure on housing by renting properties on short-term lets .
he claimed this was a far better option than placing people in bed and breakfasts .
we are constantly looking at what more we can to do to ensure stability and fairness in the market so we can deliver the homes future first-time buyers and families need department for communities and local government spokesman he said : " we have a recession , we have a housing market downturn , more houses are going to become empty that 's for sure .
" they need to have plans in place to help private owners to get properties back in use and for their own stock - they should n't be leaving properties like this empty " .
a spokesman for the department for communities and local government said : " we are focused on maintaining the delivery of affordable homes in this challenging climate and supporting industry so it is ready for the recovery .
he said that , as well as money for affordable housing schemes and social homes , the government was also helping provide more affordable homes by buying unsold properties on the open market .
" we are constantly looking at what more we can to do to ensure stability and fairness in the market so we can deliver the homes future first-time buyers and families need , " he said .

three blast furnaces , at port talbot and scunthorpe in britain , and one in the netherlands , will shut temporarily .
officials of the community union , which represents 3,000 workers in port talbot , say they want reassurances over jobs beyond the end of the year .
corus blamed the general economic downturn for the production cut .
" we are hopeful that corus will look to retain capacity to meet long-term demand rather than make a knee-jerk reaction to short-term trends , " said michael leahy , general secretary of the community union .
robert edwards , regional director of community , which represents 3,000 workers at port talbot , said there was hope that the company could overcome short-term difficulties .
" certainly this ca n't have come at a worse time in the run up to christmas with people concerned about their finances and this means our members are walking a path of uncertainty , " he said .
' lot of energy ' the cut is greater than expected .
last month , corus said it would cut production between october and december by a million tonnes of crude steel - about 20 % of its output .
in a statement the firm said it had now decided to extend these production cuts beyond december .
mr edwards said : " at the moment we have a promise from corus that there wo n't be any redundancies , this will run out at the end of december and they 've said this -lsb- production cut -rsb- will go on into march , so we will have to talk with the company , both nationally and locally , about what that means for our members .
" there are things which they could consider in the meantime - a re-lining is due for one of the furnaces at port talbot , so maybe they should take advantage of this downturn until there is a change in the market . "
one blast furnace at scunthorpe , port talbot , and ijmuiden in the netherlands , will be temporarily shut down , the firm said .
mr edwards said he could understand the company 's approach in the temporary shutdowns of the furnaces .
" i 'm an ex-blast furnaceman myself , blast furnaces take up a lot of energy , they gobble it up to be honest , and they do use a lot of coal so it makes sense . "
corus chief executive , philippe varin , said corus had to adapt " to the changing environment with maximum speed " .
the firm , which employs more than 24,000 workers in the uk , also announced 400 job losses in its distribution business , on 6 november .

three blast furnaces , at port talbot and scunthorpe in britain , and one in the netherlands , will shut temporarily .
officials of the community union , which represents 3,000 workers in port talbot , say they want reassurances over jobs beyond the end of the year .
corus blamed the general economic downturn for the production cut .
" we are hopeful that corus will look to retain capacity to meet long-term demand rather than make a knee-jerk reaction to short-term trends , " said michael leahy , general secretary of the community union .
robert edwards , regional director of community , which represents 3,000 workers at port talbot , said there was hope that the company could overcome short-term difficulties .
" certainly this ca n't have come at a worse time in the run up to christmas with people concerned about their finances and this means our members are walking a path of uncertainty , " he said .
' lot of energy ' the cut is greater than expected .
last month , corus said it would cut production between october and december by a million tonnes of crude steel - about 20 % of its output .

mr edwards said : " at the moment we have a promise from corus that there wo n't be any redundancies , this will run out at the end of december and they 've said this -lsb- production cut -rsb- will go on into march , so we will have to talk with the company , both nationally and locally , about what that means for our members .

" i 'm an ex-blast furnaceman myself , blast furnaces take up a lot of energy , they gobble it up to be honest , and they do use a lot of coal so it makes sense . "
corus chief executive , philippe varin , said corus had to adapt " to the changing environment with maximum speed " .
the firm , which employs more than 24,000 workers in the uk , also announced 400 job losses in its distribution business , on 6 november .

following your conversation with peter burt we -lrb- george mathewson and peter burt -rrb- , are writing to outline our thoughts in relation to the proposed takeover of hbos plc by lloyds tsb group plc .
we are sure that you recognise the need for the hbos board to be seeking the best option for its shareholders and indeed , for all stakeholders as required by the recent companies legislation .
we also recognise that you and your colleagues have endured a traumatic year and are doubtlessly suffering from the inevitable fatigue that the situation has created .
2 .
nevertheless you appear determined to continue with the takeover by lloyds on terms which perversely were made worse for the hbos shareholders following the comprehensive actions implemented by the government to allay the systemic crisis and to restore financial stability to the uk banking sector .
3 .
in the words of tom scholar , managing director , international & finance hmt , hmg have put a floor under the banking crisis and have thereby provided the hbos board and the hbos shareholders with an opportunity that , we believe , is likely to be of far greater value than simply subscribing to a deal put together in haste , a deal that should have been obsolete within days of being announced due to the government 's positive recapitalisation actions .
in short , the terms of the takeover are unfair to hbos shareholders and we believe there are better options available , which the board should be exploring .
the failure to do so is to sacrifice the opportunity for shareholders to recover substantial lost value .
4 .
when you spoke to me , i requested that you and andy hornby resign and that you appoint me and george mathewson to the board of directors of hbos plc as chairman and chief executive respectively .
we repeat that request here .
it is our intention to create a detailed alternative plan that we believe will represent better value for both the hbos shareholders and stakeholders by keeping hbos as an independent bank .
the board can accept the government 's offer of financing , return hbos to its core business using prudent underwriting practices for existing and new customers alike , establish relations with new investors globally and carry out a full strategic review of hbos ' assets and non-core businesses with fresh sets of eyes to maximise shareholder value .
5 .
in the absence of your support for this , we intend to canvass shareholder support with a view to requisitioning an egm to seek your and andy hornby 's removal from the board and the appointment of george and myself .
6 .
the hbos shareholders then can be assured that every possible option will have been explored and that their interests have been fully considered .
7 .
for the avoidance of doubt , we firmly believe that a standalone recapitalised hbos , which has had a strategic plan agreed and new management teams put into place will represent far greater upside and stability than the lloyds takeover .
if , however , lloyds makes a more appropriate commercial offer for hbos that too will be given full consideration .
8 .
although you signed a non-solicitation clause on september 18th , it is hard to see what the reason for renewing this agreement was on october 13th after the sector-wide recapitalisation by hmg , particularly when lloyds tsb unilaterally changed the terms to the further detriment of the hbos shareholders .
-lrb- the non-solicitation clause does not appear in the lloyds circular to its shareholders -rrb- .
in any event , as drafted , neither the implementation agreement nor a non-solicitation clause preclude the hbos board from putting together a plan themselves to preserve an independent hbos on a basis which is better for the hbos shareholders than a sale to lloyds .
instead of exploiting this opportunity once the recapitalisation plan was confirmed by hmg , you have supported what is increasingly looking like a one-sided deal .
9 .
on september 18th , the proposed takeover by lloyds appeared to be a case of a strong well-managed bank riding to the rescue of a bank in dire straights .
as the chancellor pointed out in his evidence to the commons select committee on the day of the takeover being announced hbos was not a ' … perfectly happy , functioning bank -lsb- without hmg 's intervention -rsb- … .hbos would have been in an extraordinarily difficult situation ' .
it is now clear that it was not just hbos that was in an extraordinarily difficult position - a number of banks were , including lloyds .
that information in itself should have prompted the board of hbos to urgently consider alternative plans .
we can see how the option of keeping hbos independent without immediate changes in management would have been unrealistic , hence the implementation of our own plans for those changes .
rbs has successfully changed management and remained independent and it has required more financial assistance than hbos and lloyds tsb combined .
10 .
relative to their respective sizes , lloyds now appears to require greater support than hbos .
lloyds has announced that if the takeover does not proceed , a stand-alone lloyds will be required by the fsa to raise further new capital above and beyond the £ 5.5bn currently required and a figure of an additional £ 1.5bn -lrb- a 27 % increase -rrb- has been indicated .
this means that the stand-alone lloyds would require £ 7bn of new capital equal to 63 % of its existing equity capital -lrb- £ 11.1bn -rrb- at their interim results date .
the £ 11.5bn that hbos needs is 54 % of the £ 21.1bn capital at their interim results .
these figures perhaps suggest that it is lloyds and not hbos that is being bailed out by the takeover , at the expense of hbos shareholders .
11 .
hbos is larger than lloyds -lrb- £ 681bn of total assets against £ 368bn of total assets -rrb- , has more equity capital than lloyds -lrb- £ 21.1bn against £ 11.1bn -rrb- , historically has been much more profitable than lloyds -lrb- in 2007 hbos earned £ 5.47bn before tax against lloyds ' £ 4.0bn -rrb- , and more efficient -lrb- in 2007 hbos ' cost to income ratio was 41 % against lloyds ' 49 % -rrb- .
with hmg providing all the new capital , hmg will have 43.5 % of the enlarged group , lloyds shareholders 36.5 % and hbos shareholders just 20 % .
under normal circumstances , hbos shareholders should be receiving two-thirds of the 56.5 % that private shareholders are retaining if hmg provides all the funds required , not the one-third or so the current offer implies .
in other words , the hbos shareholders should be receiving more than 1 lloyds share for every hbos share rather than the 0.605 to which lloyds has reduced their offer .
in light of hbos ' established ability to recapitalise , the terms greatly undervalue hbos shares , even at the original 0.833 ratio .
for more than two million smaller hbos shareholders this ratio is extremely important .
12 .
on september 18th the hbos board may have had little choice but to accede - the lloyds solution was the only one available .
but the lloyds takeover was the last of the case-by-case solutions put into place to deal with the financial crisis and as previously mentioned there is now a sector wide , generalised response designed to put stability back into the uk banking system - an action you have chosen not to use for the benefit of hbos shareholders .
recently and repeatedly the chancellor and hmt has made it clear that hmg 's offer to provide new capital and funding support is available to any bank , although obviously the amounts required will depend upon each bank 's circumstances .
13 .
the chancellor repeated his assurance that assistance is available to any eligible bank in a recent letter .
14 .
although the £ 11.5bn recapitalisation figure is specific to the lloyds takeover of hbos , hmt indicated that there is no reason why hbos could not ask for recapitalisation as a stand-alone bank .
in which case , hbos would seem unlikely to need substantially more capital than the £ 11.5bn.
hector sants , ceo of the fsa , was reported as saying that the £ 11.5bn was sufficient to recapitalise hbos .
lloyds confirmed in the notes to its circular issued this week that based on its work to date and on non-public hbos information , it expects hbos to have negative net capital adjustments of no more than £ 10 billion after tax , reduced by the amount of the hbos available-for-sale reserve which at 30 september 2008 amounted to approximately £ 4 billion .
15 .
with hmg having made the position crystal clear that there is now a level playing field , that there is capital available as required and , given the disproportionate share of total assets , net assets , historic profits and sustainable earnings that hbos shareholders are contributing in the takeover , it is surprising that the hbos board has not sought new management , to maintain an independent bank and to begin to rebuild shareholder value .
the original necessity for the lloyds takeover of hbos was to ensure the survival of the bank to gain financial stability .
in light of the availability of new capital from hmg for hbos , the takeover is no longer necessary to ensure financial stability .
it is an extraordinary price for hbos shareholders to pay for seemingly expediting your wish for a swift change in management .
16 .
nor has there been much focus on the risks and problems involved in integrating the two banks , a matter directly relevant to the creation of greater shareholder value .
the task of implementing the takeover and integrating the two businesses is enormous and lloyds is taking on a massive challenge .
it is a challenge , which would strain the resources of any company , and one taken on at a time when management of banks should never be more focussed on continuing to service their loyal , larger , retail , sme and wholesale customer base in uk during challenging economic times .
this may have particular resonance , as now it is clear lloyds has its own problems with which it has to deal .
as it has been established that they too need substantial government assistance , how does that need reflect on the lloyds management performance , abilities and resources ? 17 .
the merger does not recover the shareholder value lost in the financial crisis .
the funding problems which have brought the sector to this position and which will be faced by the combined entity will not go away .
credit lines available to a single , combined group from other banks are likely to be less than the sum available to the two individual banks .
the enlarged group would have c . £ 230bn of wholesale funding to refinance over the next 12 months .
hbos ' reliance on short term wholesale funding relative to total wholesale funding is actually lower than lloyds ' - the enlarged group would have around 63 % of its wholesale funding in short term instruments compared to hbos ' 59 % .
18 .
hbos board 's initial recommendation to shareholders to accept the offer from lloyds was made in entirely different circumstances from those at the time of the subsequent recommendation for the diminished price proposed by lloyds .
that was at a time when the hbos board was and remains in a stronger position either to negotiate a fair price from lloyds or to maintain the independence of hbos and bring in new management with the experience to create a plan that will begin to rebuild shareholder value and restore stakeholder confidence .
19 .
we believe this opportunity may be lost to the detriment of hbos shareholders who have found themselves being sold to a smaller competitor bank whose management has fared little better during this crisis , whose own financial requirements from the fsa appear to be comparatively larger than hbos ' and who have managed to extract a recommendation from the hbos board on arbitrarily reduced terms .
it is unclear why the hbos board accepted the new terms without ensuring that all opportunities to restore shareholder value , including as a stand-alone bank , were fully explored .
hbos could continue as a stand-alone bank certainly no weaker than lloyds and one with a better chance of securing the crucial necessary liquidity , to service its existing and new customer base than the proposed enlarged group .
20 .
given the importance of hbos to all the various stakeholders , and the time constraint to articulate our position we feel it is appropriate to release a copy of this letter to the public .

following your conversation with peter burt we -lrb- george mathewson and peter burt -rrb- , are writing to outline our thoughts in relation to the proposed takeover of hbos plc by lloyds tsb group plc .
we are sure that you recognise the need for the hbos board to be seeking the best option for its shareholders and indeed , for all stakeholders as required by the recent companies legislation .
we also recognise that you and your colleagues have endured a traumatic year and are doubtlessly suffering from the inevitable fatigue that the situation has created .
2 .
nevertheless you appear determined to continue with the takeover by lloyds on terms which perversely were made worse for the hbos shareholders following the comprehensive actions implemented by the government to allay the systemic crisis and to restore financial stability to the uk banking sector .
3 .
in the words of tom scholar , managing director , international & finance hmt , hmg have put a floor under the banking crisis and have thereby provided the hbos board and the hbos shareholders with an opportunity that , we believe , is likely to be of far greater value than simply subscribing to a deal put together in haste , a deal that should have been obsolete within days of being announced due to the government 's positive recapitalisation actions .
in short , the terms of the takeover are unfair to hbos shareholders and we believe there are better options available , which the board should be exploring .
the failure to do so is to sacrifice the opportunity for shareholders to recover substantial lost value .
4 .
when you spoke to me , i requested that you and andy hornby resign and that you appoint me and george mathewson to the board of directors of hbos plc as chairman and chief executive respectively .
we repeat that request here .
it is our intention to create a detailed alternative plan that we believe will represent better value for both the hbos shareholders and stakeholders by keeping hbos as an independent bank .
the board can accept the government 's offer of financing , return hbos to its core business using prudent underwriting practices for existing and new customers alike , establish relations with new investors globally and carry out a full strategic review of hbos ' assets and non-core businesses with fresh sets of eyes to maximise shareholder value .
5 .
in the absence of your support for this , we intend to canvass shareholder support with a view to requisitioning an egm to seek your and andy hornby 's removal from the board and the appointment of george and myself .
sir peter burt was one of the letter-writers 6 .
the hbos shareholders then can be assured that every possible option will have been explored and that their interests have been fully considered .
7 .
for the avoidance of doubt , we firmly believe that a standalone recapitalised hbos , which has had a strategic plan agreed and new management teams put into place will represent far greater upside and stability than the lloyds takeover .
if , however , lloyds makes a more appropriate commercial offer for hbos that too will be given full consideration .
8 .
although you signed a non-solicitation clause on september 18th , it is hard to see what the reason for renewing this agreement was on october 13th after the sector-wide recapitalisation by hmg , particularly when lloyds tsb unilaterally changed the terms to the further detriment of the hbos shareholders .
-lrb- the non-solicitation clause does not appear in the lloyds circular to its shareholders -rrb- .
in any event , as drafted , neither the implementation agreement nor a non-solicitation clause preclude the hbos board from putting together a plan themselves to preserve an independent hbos on a basis which is better for the hbos shareholders than a sale to lloyds .
instead of exploiting this opportunity once the recapitalisation plan was confirmed by hmg , you have supported what is increasingly looking like a one-sided deal .
9 .
on september 18th , the proposed takeover by lloyds appeared to be a case of a strong well-managed bank riding to the rescue of a bank in dire straights .
as the chancellor pointed out in his evidence to the commons select committee on the day of the takeover being announced hbos was not a ' … perfectly happy , functioning bank -lsb- without hmg 's intervention -rsb- … .hbos would have been in an extraordinarily difficult situation ' .
it is now clear that it was not just hbos that was in an extraordinarily difficult position - a number of banks were , including lloyds .
that information in itself should have prompted the board of hbos to urgently consider alternative plans .
we can see how the option of keeping hbos independent without immediate changes in management would have been unrealistic , hence the implementation of our own plans for those changes .
rbs has successfully changed management and remained independent and it has required more financial assistance than hbos and lloyds tsb combined .
10 .
relative to their respective sizes , lloyds now appears to require greater support than hbos .
lloyds has announced that if the takeover does not proceed , a stand-alone lloyds will be required by the fsa to raise further new capital above and beyond the £ 5.5bn currently required and a figure of an additional £ 1.5bn -lrb- a 27 % increase -rrb- has been indicated .
this means that the stand-alone lloyds would require £ 7bn of new capital equal to 63 % of its existing equity capital -lrb- £ 11.1bn -rrb- at their interim results date .
the £ 11.5bn that hbos needs is 54 % of the £ 21.1bn capital at their interim results .
these figures perhaps suggest that it is lloyds and not hbos that is being bailed out by the takeover , at the expense of hbos shareholders .
11 .
hbos is larger than lloyds -lrb- £ 681bn of total assets against £ 368bn of total assets -rrb- , has more equity capital than lloyds -lrb- £ 21.1bn against £ 11.1bn -rrb- , historically has been much more profitable than lloyds -lrb- in 2007 hbos earned £ 5.47bn before tax against lloyds ' £ 4.0bn -rrb- , and more efficient -lrb- in 2007 hbos ' cost to income ratio was 41 % against lloyds ' 49 % -rrb- .
with hmg providing all the new capital , hmg will have 43.5 % of the enlarged group , lloyds shareholders 36.5 % and hbos shareholders just 20 % .
under normal circumstances , hbos shareholders should be receiving two-thirds of the 56.5 % that private shareholders are retaining if hmg provides all the funds required , not the one-third or so the current offer implies .
in other words , the hbos shareholders should be receiving more than 1 lloyds share for every hbos share rather than the 0.605 to which lloyds has reduced their offer .
in light of hbos ' established ability to recapitalise , the terms greatly undervalue hbos shares , even at the original 0.833 ratio .
for more than two million smaller hbos shareholders this ratio is extremely important .
12 .
on september 18th the hbos board may have had little choice but to accede - the lloyds solution was the only one available .
but the lloyds takeover was the last of the case-by-case solutions put into place to deal with the financial crisis and as previously mentioned there is now a sector wide , generalised response designed to put stability back into the uk banking system - an action you have chosen not to use for the benefit of hbos shareholders .
recently and repeatedly the chancellor and hmt has made it clear that hmg 's offer to provide new capital and funding support is available to any bank , although obviously the amounts required will depend upon each bank 's circumstances .
13 .
the chancellor repeated his assurance that assistance is available to any eligible bank in a recent letter .
the letter was sent to lord stevenson 14 .
although the £ 11.5bn recapitalisation figure is specific to the lloyds takeover of hbos , hmt indicated that there is no reason why hbos could not ask for recapitalisation as a stand-alone bank .
in which case , hbos would seem unlikely to need substantially more capital than the £ 11.5bn.
hector sants , ceo of the fsa , was reported as saying that the £ 11.5bn was sufficient to recapitalise hbos .
lloyds confirmed in the notes to its circular issued this week that based on its work to date and on non-public hbos information , it expects hbos to have negative net capital adjustments of no more than £ 10 billion after tax , reduced by the amount of the hbos available-for-sale reserve which at 30 september 2008 amounted to approximately £ 4 billion .
15 .
with hmg having made the position crystal clear that there is now a level playing field , that there is capital available as required and , given the disproportionate share of total assets , net assets , historic profits and sustainable earnings that hbos shareholders are contributing in the takeover , it is surprising that the hbos board has not sought new management , to maintain an independent bank and to begin to rebuild shareholder value .
the original necessity for the lloyds takeover of hbos was to ensure the survival of the bank to gain financial stability .
in light of the availability of new capital from hmg for hbos , the takeover is no longer necessary to ensure financial stability .
it is an extraordinary price for hbos shareholders to pay for seemingly expediting your wish for a swift change in management .
16 .
nor has there been much focus on the risks and problems involved in integrating the two banks , a matter directly relevant to the creation of greater shareholder value .
the task of implementing the takeover and integrating the two businesses is enormous and lloyds is taking on a massive challenge .
it is a challenge , which would strain the resources of any company , and one taken on at a time when management of banks should never be more focussed on continuing to service their loyal , larger , retail , sme and wholesale customer base in uk during challenging economic times .
this may have particular resonance , as now it is clear lloyds has its own problems with which it has to deal .
as it has been established that they too need substantial government assistance , how does that need reflect on the lloyds management performance , abilities and resources ?

following your conversation with peter burt we -lrb- george mathewson and peter burt -rrb- , are writing to outline our thoughts in relation to the proposed takeover of hbos plc by lloyds tsb group plc .
we are sure that you recognise the need for the hbos board to be seeking the best option for its shareholders and indeed , for all stakeholders as required by the recent companies legislation .
we also recognise that you and your colleagues have endured a traumatic year and are doubtlessly suffering from the inevitable fatigue that the situation has created .
2 .
nevertheless you appear determined to continue with the takeover by lloyds on terms which perversely were made worse for the hbos shareholders following the comprehensive actions implemented by the government to allay the systemic crisis and to restore financial stability to the uk banking sector .
3 .
in the words of tom scholar , managing director , international & finance hmt , hmg have put a floor under the banking crisis and have thereby provided the hbos board and the hbos shareholders with an opportunity that , we believe , is likely to be of far greater value than simply subscribing to a deal put together in haste , a deal that should have been obsolete within days of being announced due to the government 's positive recapitalisation actions .
in short , the terms of the takeover are unfair to hbos shareholders and we believe there are better options available , which the board should be exploring .
the failure to do so is to sacrifice the opportunity for shareholders to recover substantial lost value .
4 .
when you spoke to me , i requested that you and andy hornby resign and that you appoint me and george mathewson to the board of directors of hbos plc as chairman and chief executive respectively .
we repeat that request here .
it is our intention to create a detailed alternative plan that we believe will represent better value for both the hbos shareholders and stakeholders by keeping hbos as an independent bank .
the board can accept the government 's offer of financing , return hbos to its core business using prudent underwriting practices for existing and new customers alike , establish relations with new investors globally and carry out a full strategic review of hbos ' assets and non-core businesses with fresh sets of eyes to maximise shareholder value .
5 .
in the absence of your support for this , we intend to canvass shareholder support with a view to requisitioning an egm to seek your and andy hornby 's removal from the board and the appointment of george and myself .
sir peter burt was one of the letter-writers 6 .
the hbos shareholders then can be assured that every possible option will have been explored and that their interests have been fully considered .
7 .
for the avoidance of doubt , we firmly believe that a standalone recapitalised hbos , which has had a strategic plan agreed and new management teams put into place will represent far greater upside and stability than the lloyds takeover .
if , however , lloyds makes a more appropriate commercial offer for hbos that too will be given full consideration .
8 .
although you signed a non-solicitation clause on september 18th , it is hard to see what the reason for renewing this agreement was on october 13th after the sector-wide recapitalisation by hmg , particularly when lloyds tsb unilaterally changed the terms to the further detriment of the hbos shareholders .
-lrb- the non-solicitation clause does not appear in the lloyds circular to its shareholders -rrb- .
in any event , as drafted , neither the implementation agreement nor a non-solicitation clause preclude the hbos board from putting together a plan themselves to preserve an independent hbos on a basis which is better for the hbos shareholders than a sale to lloyds .
instead of exploiting this opportunity once the recapitalisation plan was confirmed by hmg , you have supported what is increasingly looking like a one-sided deal .
9 .
on september 18th , the proposed takeover by lloyds appeared to be a case of a strong well-managed bank riding to the rescue of a bank in dire straights .
as the chancellor pointed out in his evidence to the commons select committee on the day of the takeover being announced hbos was not a ' … perfectly happy , functioning bank -lsb- without hmg 's intervention -rsb- … .hbos would have been in an extraordinarily difficult situation ' .
it is now clear that it was not just hbos that was in an extraordinarily difficult position - a number of banks were , including lloyds .
that information in itself should have prompted the board of hbos to urgently consider alternative plans .
we can see how the option of keeping hbos independent without immediate changes in management would have been unrealistic , hence the implementation of our own plans for those changes .
rbs has successfully changed management and remained independent and it has required more financial assistance than hbos and lloyds tsb combined .
10 .
relative to their respective sizes , lloyds now appears to require greater support than hbos .
lloyds has announced that if the takeover does not proceed , a stand-alone lloyds will be required by the fsa to raise further new capital above and beyond the £ 5.5bn currently required and a figure of an additional £ 1.5bn -lrb- a 27 % increase -rrb- has been indicated .
this means that the stand-alone lloyds would require £ 7bn of new capital equal to 63 % of its existing equity capital -lrb- £ 11.1bn -rrb- at their interim results date .
the £ 11.5bn that hbos needs is 54 % of the £ 21.1bn capital at their interim results .
these figures perhaps suggest that it is lloyds and not hbos that is being bailed out by the takeover , at the expense of hbos shareholders .
11 .
hbos is larger than lloyds -lrb- £ 681bn of total assets against £ 368bn of total assets -rrb- , has more equity capital than lloyds -lrb- £ 21.1bn against £ 11.1bn -rrb- , historically has been much more profitable than lloyds -lrb- in 2007 hbos earned £ 5.47bn before tax against lloyds ' £ 4.0bn -rrb- , and more efficient -lrb- in 2007 hbos ' cost to income ratio was 41 % against lloyds ' 49 % -rrb- .
with hmg providing all the new capital , hmg will have 43.5 % of the enlarged group , lloyds shareholders 36.5 % and hbos shareholders just 20 % .
under normal circumstances , hbos shareholders should be receiving two-thirds of the 56.5 % that private shareholders are retaining if hmg provides all the funds required , not the one-third or so the current offer implies .
in other words , the hbos shareholders should be receiving more than 1 lloyds share for every hbos share rather than the 0.605 to which lloyds has reduced their offer .
in light of hbos ' established ability to recapitalise , the terms greatly undervalue hbos shares , even at the original 0.833 ratio .
for more than two million smaller hbos shareholders this ratio is extremely important .
12 .
on september 18th the hbos board may have had little choice but to accede - the lloyds solution was the only one available .
but the lloyds takeover was the last of the case-by-case solutions put into place to deal with the financial crisis and as previously mentioned there is now a sector wide , generalised response designed to put stability back into the uk banking system - an action you have chosen not to use for the benefit of hbos shareholders .
recently and repeatedly the chancellor and hmt has made it clear that hmg 's offer to provide new capital and funding support is available to any bank , although obviously the amounts required will depend upon each bank 's circumstances .
13 .
the chancellor repeated his assurance that assistance is available to any eligible bank in a recent letter .
the letter was sent to lord stevenson 14 .
although the £ 11.5bn recapitalisation figure is specific to the lloyds takeover of hbos , hmt indicated that there is no reason why hbos could not ask for recapitalisation as a stand-alone bank .
in which case , hbos would seem unlikely to need substantially more capital than the £ 11.5bn.
hector sants , ceo of the fsa , was reported as saying that the £ 11.5bn was sufficient to recapitalise hbos .
lloyds confirmed in the notes to its circular issued this week that based on its work to date and on non-public hbos information , it expects hbos to have negative net capital adjustments of no more than £ 10 billion after tax , reduced by the amount of the hbos available-for-sale reserve which at 30 september 2008 amounted to approximately £ 4 billion .
15 .
with hmg having made the position crystal clear that there is now a level playing field , that there is capital available as required and , given the disproportionate share of total assets , net assets , historic profits and sustainable earnings that hbos shareholders are contributing in the takeover , it is surprising that the hbos board has not sought new management , to maintain an independent bank and to begin to rebuild shareholder value .
the original necessity for the lloyds takeover of hbos was to ensure the survival of the bank to gain financial stability .
in light of the availability of new capital from hmg for hbos , the takeover is no longer necessary to ensure financial stability .
it is an extraordinary price for hbos shareholders to pay for seemingly expediting your wish for a swift change in management .
16 .
nor has there been much focus on the risks and problems involved in integrating the two banks , a matter directly relevant to the creation of greater shareholder value .
the task of implementing the takeover and integrating the two businesses is enormous and lloyds is taking on a massive challenge .
it is a challenge , which would strain the resources of any company , and one taken on at a time when management of banks should never be more focussed on continuing to service their loyal , larger , retail , sme and wholesale customer base in uk during challenging economic times .
this may have particular resonance , as now it is clear lloyds has its own problems with which it has to deal .
as it has been established that they too need substantial government assistance , how does that need reflect on the lloyds management performance , abilities and resources ?

the merger does not recover the shareholder value lost in the financial crisis .
the funding problems which have brought the sector to this position and which will be faced by the combined entity will not go away .
credit lines available to a single , combined group from other banks are likely to be less than the sum available to the two individual banks .
the enlarged group would have c . £ 230bn of wholesale funding to refinance over the next 12 months .
hbos ' reliance on short term wholesale funding relative to total wholesale funding is actually lower than lloyds ' - the enlarged group would have around 63 % of its wholesale funding in short term instruments compared to hbos ' 59 % .
18 .
hbos board 's initial recommendation to shareholders to accept the offer from lloyds was made in entirely different circumstances from those at the time of the subsequent recommendation for the diminished price proposed by lloyds .
that was at a time when the hbos board was and remains in a stronger position either to negotiate a fair price from lloyds or to maintain the independence of hbos and bring in new management with the experience to create a plan that will begin to rebuild shareholder value and restore stakeholder confidence .
19 .
we believe this opportunity may be lost to the detriment of hbos shareholders who have found themselves being sold to a smaller competitor bank whose management has fared little better during this crisis , whose own financial requirements from the fsa appear to be comparatively larger than hbos ' and who have managed to extract a recommendation from the hbos board on arbitrarily reduced terms .
it is unclear why the hbos board accepted the new terms without ensuring that all opportunities to restore shareholder value , including as a stand-alone bank , were fully explored .
hbos could continue as a stand-alone bank certainly no weaker than lloyds and one with a better chance of securing the crucial necessary liquidity , to service its existing and new customer base than the proposed enlarged group .
20 .
given the importance of hbos to all the various stakeholders , and the time constraint to articulate our position we feel it is appropriate to release a copy of this letter to the public .
