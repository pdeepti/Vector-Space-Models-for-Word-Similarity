but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics .

at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .

" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.07.2008 industrial output plunges in europe as economic fears grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall industrial production across the eurozone is slumping new data shows industrial production in europe recorded its biggest fall in nearly 16 years in may , fuelling fears the continent 's economy is weakening as it 's buffeted by a string of global financial crises . seasonally adjusted industrial production fell month on month by 1.9 per cent in the 15-member euro zone and by 1.4 per cent in the 27-member european union , the eu statistic office , eurostat said on monday , july 14 . it was the biggest fall in industrial production since december 1992 .
the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.07.2008 belgium thrust into new crisis as pm , government quit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves leterme 's suitability as prime minister has been in question since last year 's election belgium woke up to a new political crisis tuesday when it became clear that its five-party coalition government led by prime minister yves leterme had broken down after only four months in office . flemish christian democrat leterme handed in his resignation to belgian king albert ii late monday night after it became clear he would not be unable to broker an agreement on the basis of constitutional reform or a power-sharing deal that has split the country in two .
but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king albert -lrb- r . -rrb- must now decide on leterme 's resignation the king could flatly refuse to accept leterme 's resignation and demand that he stay on , either in his current capacity or with a fixed and limited mandate .
a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .
belgium 's flemish press predicted " chaos " .
" no one can predict what is going to happen now , " said the centre-left daily de morgen , reflecting on the " chaotic atmosphere " .
" total chaos , " headlined the tabloid het laatste nieuws .
" a country on the edge of a precipice , " said french-language le soir .
one thing was sure : parties of all political stripes were due to hold crisis talks to try to chart a way ahead , and with parliament set to take a summer break on friday , a decision must come before then so deputies can endorse it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?

the euro leapt to a historic high on tuesday , surging to $ 1.6038 as investor concerns about the state of the us economy and its financial services sector grew . in morning london deals , the euro surpassed its previous all-time high of $ 1.6019 , reached on april 22 .
it later stood at 1.6026 , up from 1.5909 in new york late monday .
the surge comes as the foreign exchange market awaits congressional testimony by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke on the outlook for the us economy later tuesday . " we believe the dollar is in a very vulnerable position at present and a softening in rhetoric from bernanke is likely to trigger a new wave of dollar selling , " said economist derek halpenny at the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj . " given the ongoing turmoil - and let 's not forget indymac , the third largest bank failure in us history - the ability of chairman bernanke to ' talk up ' the dollar will be very limited , " halpenny added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rescued lenders fannie mae and freddie mac " the trouble is the market is still very unclear over the details of support for fannie mae and freddie mac , " said halpenny , referring to a government bail out of the two banks as was announced over the weekend . concerns about more banks collapsing stock markets on monday showed a temporary boost as a result of the dramatic us rescue plan for fannie mae and freddie mac , but analysts said the positive effect has since evaporated .
dealers said that skepticism about the rescue 's effectiveness in ending the financial crisis caused world equity markets to plummet again tuesday . " concerns in the us as to whether more banks are going to collapse has added to the market malaise which must have left policy makers in a sense of bewilderment given the short-lived bounce in sentiment , " said calyon analyst mitul kotecha . european equities sank lower after wall street stocks had tumbled monday in volatile trading on monday and asian markets sunk in tuesday trading . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .

russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .

" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .

prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : beijing 2008 : a question of human rights german olympics official : we 're not ignoring human rights beijing truths smothered in the smog of conflicting views amnesty international : china has made only minor progress china breaks promise of unfettered internet at olympics human rights -pipe- 15.07.2008 amnesty calls on germany , ioc to clarify beijing protest rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty wants it to be made clear how far athletes can go in their protests human rights organization amnesty international called monday , july 14 for the clarification of rules of conduct for german athletes traveling to the olympic games in beijing . " we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 . " we have a strong team .
we want to be successful , we want to combine performance and morale and have only clean success .
we want to be good ambassadors of our country , " said thomas bach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women 's hockey team won gold in 2004 germany came sixth in the athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals , 16 silver and 20 bronze .
its overall 49 medals haul was good enough for joint fourth place with australia , with the us leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals . however , it was some way off their best performance since the reunification which came in the 1992 renewal in barcelona where they managed 82 , 33 of them gold . the dosb has set its team a target of at least equaling their medals performance in the 2004 edition . their best hopes of gold this time round are american-born meredith michaels-beerbaum in show-jumping and the german women 's football team . the nominees include the basketball team around nba star dirk nowitzki , which still has to qualify for the august 8-24 games in beijing , with a tournament set for this week in athens . discus throw world champion franka dietzsch has been nominated despite injury .
tennis player rainer schuettler , a recent wimbledon semi-finalist , and swimmer vipa bernhardt , who has reached an injunction to be included , will learn about their final fate sunday . injured fitschen stays at home however , the european 10,000 meters champion jan fitschen will miss the beijing olympics due to a leg injury . " that 's it .
i would have liked to participate .
but i ca n't run without pain , " fitschen was quoted as saying on the website of the german athletics federation dlv . fitschen aimed to meet the olympic qualifying standard on sunday at a meet in belgium after being sidelined with other injury woes earlier in the season .
but a new lower-leg injury prompted him to end the season prematurely . fitschen was a surprise european champion 2006 in gothenburg . the nomination deadline set by the international olympic committee for all teams is next week wednesday , july 23 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty-eight year-old superstar ronaldino has been required to keep training with the spanish barca and 22-year-old defender rafinha has not been released by the german team schalke 04 . fifa rules stipulate that both diego and rafinha should be released as they are both under 23 . “ the release of players younger than 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " fifa said in a statement last thursday .

" there is at the moment no legal foundation that says the clubs have to release their players , ” said bremen general manager klaus allofs .
allofs said the reason for the refusal is that the olympics are not part of fifa 's official schedule . " it 's clear that if we do n't release diego , we wo n't face any sanctions , " allofs said . werder bremen has also refused to allow serbian dusko tosic to go to beijing for the olympics tournament , which runs from aug .

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.07.2008 germany 's nuclear opposition fading as energy prices soar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of germans say it 's time to put a halt to the stop skyrocketing fuel prices are leading more and more germans - including one prominent member of the green party - to challenge the country 's cherished plan of mothballing its 17 nuclear power plants . a few years ago , it would have been unthinkable for a green party member to resign over the party 's inflexibility about decommissioning atomic power plants .
but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all products made from cat and dog pelts , including clothing , blankets , toys and key chains , will be affected by the ban , which takes effect on ebay 's sites in germany , austria and switzerland .
the company explained that while cats and dogs are not protected animal species , they are often killed inhumanely for their fur .
ebay said it wanted to raise awareness of the practice among its members , and protect them from unknowingly purchasing products made with cat and dog pelts .
company spokesman witt said that the ban would be extended to other european countries such as france , italy and spain .

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics . " in view of the state of knowledge of genetics at the time , their actions were indefensible , ” continued the society .

representatives from the simon wiesenthal center -lrb- swc -rrb- were in chile this week to announce its new ad campaign for operation : last chance . the campaign aims to ensnare aribert heim , known to some as " dr. death " from mauthausen , who 's been on the run since 1962 when he was tipped off about his imminent arrest .
the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision africa -pipe- 15.07.2008 opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the call for an arrest warrant against sudanese president omar al-bashir may just be a symbolic move , but bashir and his cronies will still have to react to the genocide charges , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno-ocampo , has brought out the heavy guns in asking the court for an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir .
his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .
and the chinese will not want to forgo their continuing lucrative business with sudan . stefanie duckstein -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .
but since becoming president , medvedev has set about asserting russia 's position as the powerful neighbor on europe 's doorstep and protecting its interests on the international stage by flexing its considerable political and military muscle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.07.2008 berlin exhibitions explore ancient art and civilizations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient babylonian artworks are currently on display in the pergamon in berlin berlin hosts two special exhibitions exploring the art and culture of the lucani tribe from ancient italy and the babylonians .
both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .
and the chinese will not want to forgo their continuing lucrative business with sudan . stefanie duckstein -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 . " we have a strong team .
we want to be successful , we want to combine performance and morale and have only clean success .
we want to be good ambassadors of our country , " said thomas bach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women 's hockey team won gold in 2004 germany came sixth in the athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals , 16 silver and 20 bronze .
its overall 49 medals haul was good enough for joint fourth place with australia , with the us leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals . however , it was some way off their best performance since the reunification which came in the 1992 renewal in barcelona where they managed 82 , 33 of them gold . the dosb has set its team a target of at least equaling their medals performance in the 2004 edition . their best hopes of gold this time round are american-born meredith michaels-beerbaum in show-jumping and the german women 's football team . the nominees include the basketball team around nba star dirk nowitzki , which still has to qualify for the august 8-24 games in beijing , with a tournament set for this week in athens . discus throw world champion franka dietzsch has been nominated despite injury .
tennis player rainer schuettler , a recent wimbledon semi-finalist , and swimmer vipa bernhardt , who has reached an injunction to be included , will learn about their final fate sunday . injured fitschen stays at home however , the european 10,000 meters champion jan fitschen will miss the beijing olympics due to a leg injury . " that 's it .
i would have liked to participate .
but i ca n't run without pain , " fitschen was quoted as saying on the website of the german athletics federation dlv . fitschen aimed to meet the olympic qualifying standard on sunday at a meet in belgium after being sidelined with other injury woes earlier in the season .
but a new lower-leg injury prompted him to end the season prematurely . fitschen was a surprise european champion 2006 in gothenburg . the nomination deadline set by the international olympic committee for all teams is next week wednesday , july 23 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .

" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .

prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .

all products made from cat and dog pelts , including clothing , blankets , toys and key chains , will be affected by the ban , which takes effect on ebay 's sites in germany , austria and switzerland .
the company explained that while cats and dogs are not protected animal species , they are often killed inhumanely for their fur .
ebay said it wanted to raise awareness of the practice among its members , and protect them from unknowingly purchasing products made with cat and dog pelts .
company spokesman witt said that the ban would be extended to other european countries such as france , italy and spain .

" the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics .

the euro leapt to a historic high on tuesday , surging to $ 1.6038 as investor concerns about the state of the us economy and its financial services sector grew . in morning london deals , the euro surpassed its previous all-time high of $ 1.6019 , reached on april 22 .
it later stood at 1.6026 , up from 1.5909 in new york late monday .
the surge comes as the foreign exchange market awaits congressional testimony by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke on the outlook for the us economy later tuesday . " we believe the dollar is in a very vulnerable position at present and a softening in rhetoric from bernanke is likely to trigger a new wave of dollar selling , " said economist derek halpenny at the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj . " given the ongoing turmoil - and let 's not forget indymac , the third largest bank failure in us history - the ability of chairman bernanke to ' talk up ' the dollar will be very limited , " halpenny added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rescued lenders fannie mae and freddie mac " the trouble is the market is still very unclear over the details of support for fannie mae and freddie mac , " said halpenny , referring to a government bail out of the two banks as was announced over the weekend . concerns about more banks collapsing stock markets on monday showed a temporary boost as a result of the dramatic us rescue plan for fannie mae and freddie mac , but analysts said the positive effect has since evaporated .
dealers said that skepticism about the rescue 's effectiveness in ending the financial crisis caused world equity markets to plummet again tuesday . " concerns in the us as to whether more banks are going to collapse has added to the market malaise which must have left policy makers in a sense of bewilderment given the short-lived bounce in sentiment , " said calyon analyst mitul kotecha . european equities sank lower after wall street stocks had tumbled monday in volatile trading on monday and asian markets sunk in tuesday trading . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 .

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ it 's a dream of mine .
but werder wo n't release me . ” diego is one of three players selected by brazil to join the national team who have not been released by their clubs to play in the olympic games .
twenty-eight year-old superstar ronaldino has been required to keep training with the spanish barca and 22-year-old defender rafinha has not been released by the german team schalke 04 . fifa rules stipulate that both diego and rafinha should be released as they are both under 23 . “ the release of players younger than 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " fifa said in a statement last thursday .
" for beijing 2008 the same principle shall apply . " bremen , schalke remain unconcerned still , both bremen and schalke feel there is little fifa can do if the players , although both considered as under-23 , are not released .
" there is at the moment no legal foundation that says the clubs have to release their players , ” said bremen general manager klaus allofs .
allofs said the reason for the refusal is that the olympics are not part of fifa 's official schedule . " it 's clear that if we do n't release diego , we wo n't face any sanctions , " allofs said . werder bremen has also refused to allow serbian dusko tosic to go to beijing for the olympics tournament , which runs from aug .

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king albert -lrb- r . -rrb- must now decide on leterme 's resignation the king could flatly refuse to accept leterme 's resignation and demand that he stay on , either in his current capacity or with a fixed and limited mandate .
a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king albert -lrb- r . -rrb- must now decide on leterme 's resignation the king could flatly refuse to accept leterme 's resignation and demand that he stay on , either in his current capacity or with a fixed and limited mandate .
a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .
belgium 's flemish press predicted " chaos " .

" total chaos , " headlined the tabloid het laatste nieuws .

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .
and the chinese will not want to forgo their continuing lucrative business with sudan . stefanie duckstein -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.07.2008 medvedev criticizes west in tough foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet the new boss , same as the old boss : medvedev talks tough and warns the west russian president dmitry medvedev delivered a major foreign policy speech on tuesday july 15 , singling out us and european policies on missile defense and kosovo for criticism in a style reminiscent of his predecessor . in the speech given to russia 's diplomatic corps in moscow , medvedev said that us plans to site a missile defense system in eastern europe threatens the demise of the decades-old balance of power in europe and added that russia was prepared to execute " an adequate response " should the plans advance .
" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .
but since becoming president , medvedev has set about asserting russia 's position as the powerful neighbor on europe 's doorstep and protecting its interests on the international stage by flexing its considerable political and military muscle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the euro leapt to a historic high on tuesday , surging to $ 1.6038 as investor concerns about the state of the us economy and its financial services sector grew . in morning london deals , the euro surpassed its previous all-time high of $ 1.6019 , reached on april 22 .
it later stood at 1.6026 , up from 1.5909 in new york late monday .

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics . " in view of the state of knowledge of genetics at the time , their actions were indefensible , ” continued the society .
" it should have been clear that the eugenic measures planned were not only morally wrong but biological nonsense . " hunt for heim heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi hunters believe heim is in southern chile meanwhile , the hunt for one of the doctors believed to have taken part in the systematic murder of thousands of people during the third reich has heated up .
representatives from the simon wiesenthal center -lrb- swc -rrb- were in chile this week to announce its new ad campaign for operation : last chance . the campaign aims to ensnare aribert heim , known to some as " dr. death " from mauthausen , who 's been on the run since 1962 when he was tipped off about his imminent arrest .
the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all products made from cat and dog pelts , including clothing , blankets , toys and key chains , will be affected by the ban , which takes effect on ebay 's sites in germany , austria and switzerland .
the company explained that while cats and dogs are not protected animal species , they are often killed inhumanely for their fur .
ebay said it wanted to raise awareness of the practice among its members , and protect them from unknowingly purchasing products made with cat and dog pelts .
company spokesman witt said that the ban would be extended to other european countries such as france , italy and spain .

" obviously i 'd like to take part in the olympics , ” diego said .
“ it 's a dream of mine .

twenty-eight year-old superstar ronaldino has been required to keep training with the spanish barca and 22-year-old defender rafinha has not been released by the german team schalke 04 . fifa rules stipulate that both diego and rafinha should be released as they are both under 23 . “ the release of players younger than 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " fifa said in a statement last thursday .
" for beijing 2008 the same principle shall apply . " bremen , schalke remain unconcerned still , both bremen and schalke feel there is little fifa can do if the players , although both considered as under-23 , are not released .
" there is at the moment no legal foundation that says the clubs have to release their players , ” said bremen general manager klaus allofs .
allofs said the reason for the refusal is that the olympics are not part of fifa 's official schedule . " it 's clear that if we do n't release diego , we wo n't face any sanctions , " allofs said . werder bremen has also refused to allow serbian dusko tosic to go to beijing for the olympics tournament , which runs from aug .

" obviously i 'd like to take part in the olympics , ” diego said .
“ it 's a dream of mine .
but werder wo n't release me . ” diego is one of three players selected by brazil to join the national team who have not been released by their clubs to play in the olympic games .
twenty-eight year-old superstar ronaldino has been required to keep training with the spanish barca and 22-year-old defender rafinha has not been released by the german team schalke 04 . fifa rules stipulate that both diego and rafinha should be released as they are both under 23 . “ the release of players younger than 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " fifa said in a statement last thursday .
" for beijing 2008 the same principle shall apply . " bremen , schalke remain unconcerned still , both bremen and schalke feel there is little fifa can do if the players , although both considered as under-23 , are not released .
" there is at the moment no legal foundation that says the clubs have to release their players , ” said bremen general manager klaus allofs .
allofs said the reason for the refusal is that the olympics are not part of fifa 's official schedule . " it 's clear that if we do n't release diego , we wo n't face any sanctions , " allofs said . werder bremen has also refused to allow serbian dusko tosic to go to beijing for the olympics tournament , which runs from aug .

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.07.2008 belgium thrust into new crisis as pm , government quit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves leterme 's suitability as prime minister has been in question since last year 's election belgium woke up to a new political crisis tuesday when it became clear that its five-party coalition government led by prime minister yves leterme had broken down after only four months in office . flemish christian democrat leterme handed in his resignation to belgian king albert ii late monday night after it became clear he would not be unable to broker an agreement on the basis of constitutional reform or a power-sharing deal that has split the country in two .
but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king albert -lrb- r . -rrb- must now decide on leterme 's resignation the king could flatly refuse to accept leterme 's resignation and demand that he stay on , either in his current capacity or with a fixed and limited mandate .
a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .
belgium 's flemish press predicted " chaos " .
" no one can predict what is going to happen now , " said the centre-left daily de morgen , reflecting on the " chaotic atmosphere " .
" total chaos , " headlined the tabloid het laatste nieuws .
" a country on the edge of a precipice , " said french-language le soir .
one thing was sure : parties of all political stripes were due to hold crisis talks to try to chart a way ahead , and with parliament set to take a summer break on friday , a decision must come before then so deputies can endorse it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.07.2008 industrial output plunges in europe as economic fears grow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall industrial production across the eurozone is slumping new data shows industrial production in europe recorded its biggest fall in nearly 16 years in may , fuelling fears the continent 's economy is weakening as it 's buffeted by a string of global financial crises . seasonally adjusted industrial production fell month on month by 1.9 per cent in the 15-member euro zone and by 1.4 per cent in the 27-member european union , the eu statistic office , eurostat said on monday , july 14 . it was the biggest fall in industrial production since december 1992 .
the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .

russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .

" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .

prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.07.2008 berlin exhibitions explore ancient art and civilizations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient babylonian artworks are currently on display in the pergamon in berlin berlin hosts two special exhibitions exploring the art and culture of the lucani tribe from ancient italy and the babylonians .
both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "

green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.07.2008 germany 's nuclear opposition fading as energy prices soar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of germans say it 's time to put a halt to the stop skyrocketing fuel prices are leading more and more germans - including one prominent member of the green party - to challenge the country 's cherished plan of mothballing its 17 nuclear power plants . a few years ago , it would have been unthinkable for a green party member to resign over the party 's inflexibility about decommissioning atomic power plants .
but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 . " we have a strong team .
we want to be successful , we want to combine performance and morale and have only clean success .
we want to be good ambassadors of our country , " said thomas bach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women 's hockey team won gold in 2004 germany came sixth in the athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals , 16 silver and 20 bronze .
its overall 49 medals haul was good enough for joint fourth place with australia , with the us leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals . however , it was some way off their best performance since the reunification which came in the 1992 renewal in barcelona where they managed 82 , 33 of them gold . the dosb has set its team a target of at least equaling their medals performance in the 2004 edition . their best hopes of gold this time round are american-born meredith michaels-beerbaum in show-jumping and the german women 's football team . the nominees include the basketball team around nba star dirk nowitzki , which still has to qualify for the august 8-24 games in beijing , with a tournament set for this week in athens . discus throw world champion franka dietzsch has been nominated despite injury .

" that 's it .

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.07.2008 germany 's nuclear opposition fading as energy prices soar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of germans say it 's time to put a halt to the stop skyrocketing fuel prices are leading more and more germans - including one prominent member of the green party - to challenge the country 's cherished plan of mothballing its 17 nuclear power plants . a few years ago , it would have been unthinkable for a green party member to resign over the party 's inflexibility about decommissioning atomic power plants .
but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the euro leapt to a historic high on tuesday , surging to $ 1.6038 as investor concerns about the state of the us economy and its financial services sector grew . in morning london deals , the euro surpassed its previous all-time high of $ 1.6019 , reached on april 22 .
it later stood at 1.6026 , up from 1.5909 in new york late monday .
the surge comes as the foreign exchange market awaits congressional testimony by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke on the outlook for the us economy later tuesday . " we believe the dollar is in a very vulnerable position at present and a softening in rhetoric from bernanke is likely to trigger a new wave of dollar selling , " said economist derek halpenny at the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi ufj . " given the ongoing turmoil - and let 's not forget indymac , the third largest bank failure in us history - the ability of chairman bernanke to ' talk up ' the dollar will be very limited , " halpenny added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rescued lenders fannie mae and freddie mac " the trouble is the market is still very unclear over the details of support for fannie mae and freddie mac , " said halpenny , referring to a government bail out of the two banks as was announced over the weekend . concerns about more banks collapsing stock markets on monday showed a temporary boost as a result of the dramatic us rescue plan for fannie mae and freddie mac , but analysts said the positive effect has since evaporated .
dealers said that skepticism about the rescue 's effectiveness in ending the financial crisis caused world equity markets to plummet again tuesday . " concerns in the us as to whether more banks are going to collapse has added to the market malaise which must have left policy makers in a sense of bewilderment given the short-lived bounce in sentiment , " said calyon analyst mitul kotecha . european equities sank lower after wall street stocks had tumbled monday in volatile trading on monday and asian markets sunk in tuesday trading . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 15.07.2008 medvedev criticizes west in tough foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet the new boss , same as the old boss : medvedev talks tough and warns the west russian president dmitry medvedev delivered a major foreign policy speech on tuesday july 15 , singling out us and european policies on missile defense and kosovo for criticism in a style reminiscent of his predecessor . in the speech given to russia 's diplomatic corps in moscow , medvedev said that us plans to site a missile defense system in eastern europe threatens the demise of the decades-old balance of power in europe and added that russia was prepared to execute " an adequate response " should the plans advance .
" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .
but since becoming president , medvedev has set about asserting russia 's position as the powerful neighbor on europe 's doorstep and protecting its interests on the international stage by flexing its considerable political and military muscle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .
but since becoming president , medvedev has set about asserting russia 's position as the powerful neighbor on europe 's doorstep and protecting its interests on the international stage by flexing its considerable political and military muscle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king albert -lrb- r . -rrb- must now decide on leterme 's resignation the king could flatly refuse to accept leterme 's resignation and demand that he stay on , either in his current capacity or with a fixed and limited mandate .
a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .
belgium 's flemish press predicted " chaos " .
" no one can predict what is going to happen now , " said the centre-left daily de morgen , reflecting on the " chaotic atmosphere " .
" total chaos , " headlined the tabloid het laatste nieuws .
" a country on the edge of a precipice , " said french-language le soir .
one thing was sure : parties of all political stripes were due to hold crisis talks to try to chart a way ahead , and with parliament set to take a summer break on friday , a decision must come before then so deputies can endorse it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.07.2008 berlin exhibitions explore ancient art and civilizations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient babylonian artworks are currently on display in the pergamon in berlin berlin hosts two special exhibitions exploring the art and culture of the lucani tribe from ancient italy and the babylonians .
both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend .

" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.07.2008 germany 's nuclear opposition fading as energy prices soar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of germans say it 's time to put a halt to the stop skyrocketing fuel prices are leading more and more germans - including one prominent member of the green party - to challenge the country 's cherished plan of mothballing its 17 nuclear power plants . a few years ago , it would have been unthinkable for a green party member to resign over the party 's inflexibility about decommissioning atomic power plants .
but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics . " in view of the state of knowledge of genetics at the time , their actions were indefensible , ” continued the society .

representatives from the simon wiesenthal center -lrb- swc -rrb- were in chile this week to announce its new ad campaign for operation : last chance . the campaign aims to ensnare aribert heim , known to some as " dr. death " from mauthausen , who 's been on the run since 1962 when he was tipped off about his imminent arrest .
the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics . " in view of the state of knowledge of genetics at the time , their actions were indefensible , ” continued the society .

the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.07.2008 berlin exhibitions explore ancient art and civilizations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient babylonian artworks are currently on display in the pergamon in berlin berlin hosts two special exhibitions exploring the art and culture of the lucani tribe from ancient italy and the babylonians .
both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics . " in view of the state of knowledge of genetics at the time , their actions were indefensible , ” continued the society .
" it should have been clear that the eugenic measures planned were not only morally wrong but biological nonsense .

the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics . " in view of the state of knowledge of genetics at the time , their actions were indefensible , ” continued the society .
" it should have been clear that the eugenic measures planned were not only morally wrong but biological nonsense . " hunt for heim heats up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi hunters believe heim is in southern chile meanwhile , the hunt for one of the doctors believed to have taken part in the systematic murder of thousands of people during the third reich has heated up .
representatives from the simon wiesenthal center -lrb- swc -rrb- were in chile this week to announce its new ad campaign for operation : last chance . the campaign aims to ensnare aribert heim , known to some as " dr. death " from mauthausen , who 's been on the run since 1962 when he was tipped off about his imminent arrest .
the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .

babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .

the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands .

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 .

the surge comes as the foreign exchange market awaits congressional testimony by federal reserve chairman ben bernanke on the outlook for the us economy later tuesday .

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics .

representatives from the simon wiesenthal center -lrb- swc -rrb- were in chile this week to announce its new ad campaign for operation : last chance . the campaign aims to ensnare aribert heim , known to some as " dr. death " from mauthausen , who 's been on the run since 1962 when he was tipped off about his imminent arrest .
the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.07.2008 berlin exhibitions explore ancient art and civilizations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient babylonian artworks are currently on display in the pergamon in berlin berlin hosts two special exhibitions exploring the art and culture of the lucani tribe from ancient italy and the babylonians .
both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.07.2008 germany 's nuclear opposition fading as energy prices soar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of germans say it 's time to put a halt to the stop skyrocketing fuel prices are leading more and more germans - including one prominent member of the green party - to challenge the country 's cherished plan of mothballing its 17 nuclear power plants . a few years ago , it would have been unthinkable for a green party member to resign over the party 's inflexibility about decommissioning atomic power plants .
but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .
and the chinese will not want to forgo their continuing lucrative business with sudan . stefanie duckstein -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many of those sterilized died as a consequence of the operation , and historians estimate that 200,000 were euthanized as part of the nazi eugenics program . the forced sterilization and euthanasia program developed as a consequence of the " law to prevent hereditary diseased offspring , " which was enacted on july 14 , 1933 and was based on the controversial theory that one could improve the human race through selective breeding . " the new law served the ns -lrb- national socialist -rrb- regime as a basis to brutally and systematically violate the fundamental human rights of targeted citizens whose lives the regime deemed ' unworthy ' , " said members of the german society of human genetics in a statement released this week to coincide with the 20th international congress of genetics .

the 94-year-old austrian served as medical doctor at the sachsenhausen , buchenwald , and mauthausen concentration camps .
at mauthausen , he murdered hundreds by administering lethal injections during the fall of 1941 . the chief nazi hunter at swc , efraim zuroff , said that the center had received two important tips about heim 's whereabouts , effectively tracking him to chile or southern argentina .
heim is believed to have visited the town of bariloche , argentina over 50 times in one year .
heim 's daughter lives 350 kilometers -lrb- 217 miles -rrb- away in the southern chilean town of puerto montt . while zuroff ca n't say these tips will lead to heim 's immediate capture , he hopes that the ad campaign and a reward of 315,000 euros -lrb- $ 500,000 -rrb- will eventually result in heim 's arrest . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 . " we have a strong team .
we want to be successful , we want to combine performance and morale and have only clean success .
we want to be good ambassadors of our country , " said thomas bach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women 's hockey team won gold in 2004 germany came sixth in the athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals , 16 silver and 20 bronze .
its overall 49 medals haul was good enough for joint fourth place with australia , with the us leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals . however , it was some way off their best performance since the reunification which came in the 1992 renewal in barcelona where they managed 82 , 33 of them gold . the dosb has set its team a target of at least equaling their medals performance in the 2004 edition . their best hopes of gold this time round are american-born meredith michaels-beerbaum in show-jumping and the german women 's football team . the nominees include the basketball team around nba star dirk nowitzki , which still has to qualify for the august 8-24 games in beijing , with a tournament set for this week in athens . discus throw world champion franka dietzsch has been nominated despite injury .
tennis player rainer schuettler , a recent wimbledon semi-finalist , and swimmer vipa bernhardt , who has reached an injunction to be included , will learn about their final fate sunday . injured fitschen stays at home however , the european 10,000 meters champion jan fitschen will miss the beijing olympics due to a leg injury . " that 's it .
i would have liked to participate .
but i ca n't run without pain , " fitschen was quoted as saying on the website of the german athletics federation dlv . fitschen aimed to meet the olympic qualifying standard on sunday at a meet in belgium after being sidelined with other injury woes earlier in the season .
but a new lower-leg injury prompted him to end the season prematurely . fitschen was a surprise european champion 2006 in gothenburg . the nomination deadline set by the international olympic committee for all teams is next week wednesday , july 23 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 15.07.2008 belgium thrust into new crisis as pm , government quit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yves leterme 's suitability as prime minister has been in question since last year 's election belgium woke up to a new political crisis tuesday when it became clear that its five-party coalition government led by prime minister yves leterme had broken down after only four months in office . flemish christian democrat leterme handed in his resignation to belgian king albert ii late monday night after it became clear he would not be unable to broker an agreement on the basis of constitutional reform or a power-sharing deal that has split the country in two .
but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king albert -lrb- r . -rrb- must now decide on leterme 's resignation the king could flatly refuse to accept leterme 's resignation and demand that he stay on , either in his current capacity or with a fixed and limited mandate .
a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .
belgium 's flemish press predicted " chaos " .
" no one can predict what is going to happen now , " said the centre-left daily de morgen , reflecting on the " chaotic atmosphere " .
" total chaos , " headlined the tabloid het laatste nieuws .
" a country on the edge of a precipice , " said french-language le soir .
one thing was sure : parties of all political stripes were due to hold crisis talks to try to chart a way ahead , and with parliament set to take a summer break on friday , a decision must come before then so deputies can endorse it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" obviously i 'd like to take part in the olympics , ” diego said .
“ it 's a dream of mine .
but werder wo n't release me . ” diego is one of three players selected by brazil to join the national team who have not been released by their clubs to play in the olympic games .
twenty-eight year-old superstar ronaldino has been required to keep training with the spanish barca and 22-year-old defender rafinha has not been released by the german team schalke 04 . fifa rules stipulate that both diego and rafinha should be released as they are both under 23 . “ the release of players younger than 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " fifa said in a statement last thursday .
" for beijing 2008 the same principle shall apply . " bremen , schalke remain unconcerned still , both bremen and schalke feel there is little fifa can do if the players , although both considered as under-23 , are not released .
" there is at the moment no legal foundation that says the clubs have to release their players , ” said bremen general manager klaus allofs .
allofs said the reason for the refusal is that the olympics are not part of fifa 's official schedule . " it 's clear that if we do n't release diego , we wo n't face any sanctions , " allofs said . werder bremen has also refused to allow serbian dusko tosic to go to beijing for the olympics tournament , which runs from aug .

there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .
but since becoming president , medvedev has set about asserting russia 's position as the powerful neighbor on europe 's doorstep and protecting its interests on the international stage by flexing its considerable political and military muscle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.07.2008 germany 's nuclear opposition fading as energy prices soar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of germans say it 's time to put a halt to the stop skyrocketing fuel prices are leading more and more germans - including one prominent member of the green party - to challenge the country 's cherished plan of mothballing its 17 nuclear power plants . a few years ago , it would have been unthinkable for a green party member to resign over the party 's inflexibility about decommissioning atomic power plants .
but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 . " we have a strong team .
we want to be successful , we want to combine performance and morale and have only clean success .
we want to be good ambassadors of our country , " said thomas bach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women 's hockey team won gold in 2004 germany came sixth in the athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals , 16 silver and 20 bronze .
its overall 49 medals haul was good enough for joint fourth place with australia , with the us leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals . however , it was some way off their best performance since the reunification which came in the 1992 renewal in barcelona where they managed 82 , 33 of them gold . the dosb has set its team a target of at least equaling their medals performance in the 2004 edition . their best hopes of gold this time round are american-born meredith michaels-beerbaum in show-jumping and the german women 's football team . the nominees include the basketball team around nba star dirk nowitzki , which still has to qualify for the august 8-24 games in beijing , with a tournament set for this week in athens . discus throw world champion franka dietzsch has been nominated despite injury .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.07.2008 berlin exhibitions explore ancient art and civilizations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient babylonian artworks are currently on display in the pergamon in berlin berlin hosts two special exhibitions exploring the art and culture of the lucani tribe from ancient italy and the babylonians .
both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 15.07.2008 germany 's nuclear opposition fading as energy prices soar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing numbers of germans say it 's time to put a halt to the stop skyrocketing fuel prices are leading more and more germans - including one prominent member of the green party - to challenge the country 's cherished plan of mothballing its 17 nuclear power plants . a few years ago , it would have been unthinkable for a green party member to resign over the party 's inflexibility about decommissioning atomic power plants .
but that 's exactly what happened on monday , july 13 , when margareta wolf , a former member of parliament and deputy party spokeswoman , announced she had severed her ties with germany 's green party .
in an official statement , wolf said she was quitting because of the greens ' intransigience by insisting on simultaneously phasing out nuclear power and freezing the construction of new coal-burning plants .
" my party has maneuvered itself into a strategic dead-end on this issue , from which it will only emerge if it returns to an objective , non-romanticized debate and starts an open dialogue that does n't defame every thing that gets voiced , " wolf wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolf 's resignation did n't mince words about the greens she also accused the party of " losing relevance " and pursuing policies that " bordered on the dumbing-down of the public . "
green party co-leader reinhold buetikofer was quick to downplay the decision by wolf , who resigned her parliamentary mandate in 2007 to work for a communication consulting company with connections to germany 's nuclear power industry " she was no longer a green politician , " bütikofer told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
that may be true , but what once was a done deal - germany 's commitment to phasing out all of its nuclear power plants by 2021 - has re-emerged as a hot-button political issue .
conservative chancellor angela merkel and other influential members of her christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- have recently stepped up criticism of that agreement , reached by the social democrats and the greens in 2000 .
they have questioned whether europe 's biggest economy can afford to shut the nuclear plants as oil prices soar and countries such as france and the uk opt to build more reactors to cut carbon-dioxide emissions .
phase-out on the way out ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the industry says germany ca n't afford to abandon nuclear energy germany 's influential der spiegel magazine featured the re-opened debate about nuclear energy in its first title story in july , and most other german media , from broadsheets to tabloid to television , have also been devoting considerable attention to the topic .
this does not seem to be a case of tv and newspaper editors struggling to fill headlines and air-time during the slow summer months .
public opinion is also turning toward re-examining the nuclear option .
in a poll commissioned by the german public television station ard early in july , only 51 percent of those surveyed approved of the phase-out , while 44 percent disapproved - compared with 58 and 36 percent in a survey conducted only seven months before in december 2007 .
some have suggested that germany 's existing nuclear power plants be allowed to operate longer , or that the country even start planning new ones .
rightly or wrongly , the swing in sentiment is almost surely the result of the record high prices for oil being set on a nearly daily basis and the commensurate pinch many germans are feeling at the gas pumps .
with the 2009 national elections rapidly approaching , it 's a trend that has the potential to redefine germany 's political landscape .
challenge or opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slight majority of germans still favor the phase-out the party with the most at stake in this issue is the greens , and it is taking the questioning of the nuclear consensus seriously .
ironically , the debate may help the greens , currently the smallest of germany 's three opposition parties , by mobilizing those with strong anti-nuclear views .
" this is good for the greens , " deputy party spokesperson joerg althoff said . " voters know that they have to vote green in order to rule out a return to nuclear energy . "
there is scant chance that the greens will fundamentally change their position since the party itself originated in the anti-nuclear ecology movement of the late 1970s and early ' 80s .
" it 's about branding , " rüdiger robert , a political scientist at the university of muenster said . " they would give up a major piece of their identity . "
experts like robert see the greens ' major problem not in their commitment to the nuclear phase-out and renewable energy sources , but in their plans about how germany can fill the gaps as more and more reactors go off-line .
germany 's 17 active nuclear reactors currently produce a quarter of the country 's electricity .
the greens ' own 2020 plan says that germany 's energy needs can be met by raising efficiency in energy use by 16 percent .
but they have a long way to go before 2009 to convince the electorate that that vision is realistic .
atomic splits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atoms may be tiny , but they cause a big fuss to achieve their aims , or perhaps just preserve what they consider their achievements , the greens need the cooperation of one of the larger parties .
and their traditional coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , are engaged in an internal debate of the nuclear issue .
former spd economics minister wolfgang clement has been sharply critical of the phase-out , and green party insiders admit to feeling nervous about the social democrats ' commitment to the agreement they jointly negotiated in 2000 .
for the time being , though , the spd is likely to keep their current position .
" opinions within the spd differ , but i 'm sure they 'll stick with the phase-out , " robert said .
" their constituency would be unlikey to reward a change of position . "
there has also been lots of speculation about the conservative cdu campaigning on the issue against both the greens and the spd next year .
" it 's difficult to predict , " robert said .
" issues can gain momentum .
it 's certainly within the realm of imagination since it would be a populist topic . "
germany is n't changing course yet .
but it is currently trying to sort out whether it can afford to keep an anti-nuclear pledge that has been a source of pride for many germans in the past few years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king albert -lrb- r . -rrb- must now decide on leterme 's resignation the king could flatly refuse to accept leterme 's resignation and demand that he stay on , either in his current capacity or with a fixed and limited mandate .
a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .
belgium 's flemish press predicted " chaos " .
" no one can predict what is going to happen now , " said the centre-left daily de morgen , reflecting on the " chaotic atmosphere " .
" total chaos , " headlined the tabloid het laatste nieuws .
" a country on the edge of a precipice , " said french-language le soir .
one thing was sure : parties of all political stripes were due to hold crisis talks to try to chart a way ahead , and with parliament set to take a summer break on friday , a decision must come before then so deputies can endorse it . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians can deploy troops at will without the cfe russia pulled out of a key soviet-era treaty limiting troop movements and arms buildups across the continent in the fall after the souring of negotiations on us missile plans and over us backing for the expansion of nato forces along its border .
russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .
but since becoming president , medvedev has set about asserting russia 's position as the powerful neighbor on europe 's doorstep and protecting its interests on the international stage by flexing its considerable political and military muscle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the slide comes against a backdrop of soaring inflation , surging oil prices and the fallout from a weakening global economy and credit crisis . adding to the pressure on the 15 countries sharing the euro has been the strength of the common currency , which last week edged back up towards it all-time high of just over $ 1.60 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european steel industry is also feeling the pain despite being considered by economists as a key if volatile economic indicator , the industrial production contraction will also add to expectations that growth in the european economy will slip back a gear in the run-up to the end of the year . the monthly fall in industrial production translated into an annual 0.6 per cent in the euro zone dragged down by the slumping output in the currency bloc 's three biggest economies germany , france and italy .
data released showed exports from germany and france , which together account for almost half the euro zone ’ s output falling in may . industrial output down europe-wide the increasingly gloomy economic picture emerging in europe also came amid signs that the us mortgage market crisis still poses risks for the world economic outlook with washington throwing two key lenders financial lifelines over the weekend . " the crisis is by no means over , " banking expert dirk schiereck told the dpa news agency .
" it will continue through the second half of the year , " the european business school professor said . year-on-year industrial output in the broader-based eu fell by 0.5 per cent , eurostat said , with 18 of the 27 member states clocking up a drop in industrial production .
the fall in eu industrial production also followed evidence that central and eastern europe 's once booming economies are losing momentum . inflation affects consumer demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco-german planemaker airbus has been hit by the effects of a weak dollar economists had also expected a grim set of industrial production data , predicting a 2.3 per cent month-on-month fall but a modest year-on-year gain of 0.3 per cent . helping to lead the fall in euro zone industrial production was a sharp 3.3-per-cent month on month drop in durable consumer goods in may .
this represented a 5.2 per cent annual fall and points to worries that rising inflation and growing economic uncertainty is taking its toll on consumer demand just as slowing global growth and a strong currency are undercutting exports .
in april , production grew by 1.0 per cent in the euro zone and 0.3 per cent in the eu . the slump in euro zone industrial production could make it more difficult for the european central bank to raise interest rates again in the coming months .
the ecb delivered a 25-basis points increase in the cost of money this month to ward off renewed inflationary pressures in the euro zone . at four percent , euro zone inflation now stands at double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 per cent " with soaring food and energy costs having sparked a global pickup in inflation . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas .

" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 .

" we welcome it if athletes take a position on human rights , " said barbara lochbihler , the secretary general of amnesty international deutschland in a statement issued in berlin , " but it must be clear what is allowed and where . " lochbihler called on the international olympic committee to clarify the existing regulations on human rights protests and demonstrations of support " so sports officials and athletes do n't let -lrb- the olympics -rrb- down . "
she added that , in amnesty 's opinion , the campaigning for human rights should be allowed everywhere . " if an athlete says he or she is a supporter of human rights then this does n't mean they are being anti-chinese , " she said .
" there is no political propaganda in wearing sports for human rights wristbands . " the wearing of the green and blue plastic wristbands - designed by a group of german athletes - in competition venues is prohibited by current olympic rules . the olympic charter says in article 51 that " no kind of demonstration or political , religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any olympic sites , venues or other areas . " violations can lead to disqualification and loss of olympic accreditation .
on the other hand , some countries - like germany and italy - have left it up to the discretion of their athletes to protest and lend their names to campaigns in defense of human rights if they so desire . germany leaves protests to athletes ' discretion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dosb leaves it up to their athletes to decide " we regard our athletes as responsible individuals who are free to express their attitudes and opinions , " michael schirp from the german olympic sport federation -lrb- dosb -rrb- told dw-world.de.
" in the athlete 's agreement , which is formulated for the german team at every olympic games , there will be included information referring to rule 51 of the olympic charter .
it is then up to them . " lochbihler added that amnesty international would not be offering advice to athletes as to what they should and should n't do while in beijing .
lochbihler did criticize , however , the list of rules published by the ioc concerning the behavior and conduct of foreign visitors in china . in an open letter to the president of the dosb and ioc vice-president , thomas bach , lochbihler wrote that some of the rules were very vague and open to interpretation . she urged bach to revise the guidelines so visitors fully understood what was allowed and that no-one fell foul of the chinese authorities through any misunderstanding of the rules . one example she pointed out concerned so-called " offensive banners " .
" at no point is the definition of what is offensive given , " lochbihler wrote in her letter . germany sends 435-strong team to china the dosb meanwhile has nominated 435 athletes for next month 's beijing olympics , a team slightly smaller than 2004 in athens . the dosb on tuesday named 231 athletes after picking the other 204 at two previous occasions . the numbers make the team smaller than the 452 athletes who competed in athens , and a little bigger than the 428 who went to sydney 2000 . " we have a strong team .
we want to be successful , we want to combine performance and morale and have only clean success .
we want to be good ambassadors of our country , " said thomas bach . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german women 's hockey team won gold in 2004 germany came sixth in the athens 2004 medal table with 13 gold medals , 16 silver and 20 bronze .
its overall 49 medals haul was good enough for joint fourth place with australia , with the us leading the table with 36-39-27 medals and the overall list with 102 medals . however , it was some way off their best performance since the reunification which came in the 1992 renewal in barcelona where they managed 82 , 33 of them gold . the dosb has set its team a target of at least equaling their medals performance in the 2004 edition . their best hopes of gold this time round are american-born meredith michaels-beerbaum in show-jumping and the german women 's football team . the nominees include the basketball team around nba star dirk nowitzki , which still has to qualify for the august 8-24 games in beijing , with a tournament set for this week in athens . discus throw world champion franka dietzsch has been nominated despite injury .
tennis player rainer schuettler , a recent wimbledon semi-finalist , and swimmer vipa bernhardt , who has reached an injunction to be included , will learn about their final fate sunday . injured fitschen stays at home however , the european 10,000 meters champion jan fitschen will miss the beijing olympics due to a leg injury . " that 's it .

twenty-eight year-old superstar ronaldino has been required to keep training with the spanish barca and 22-year-old defender rafinha has not been released by the german team schalke 04 . fifa rules stipulate that both diego and rafinha should be released as they are both under 23 . “ the release of players younger than 23 has always been mandatory for all clubs , " fifa said in a statement last thursday .
" for beijing 2008 the same principle shall apply . " bremen , schalke remain unconcerned still , both bremen and schalke feel there is little fifa can do if the players , although both considered as under-23 , are not released .
" there is at the moment no legal foundation that says the clubs have to release their players , ” said bremen general manager klaus allofs .
allofs said the reason for the refusal is that the olympics are not part of fifa 's official schedule . " it 's clear that if we do n't release diego , we wo n't face any sanctions , " allofs said . werder bremen has also refused to allow serbian dusko tosic to go to beijing for the olympics tournament , which runs from aug .

but after a four-hour meeting with his prime minister , albert rejected the resignation of the government , instead favoring a deliberation period where he would consider whether to accept the move .
the royal palace said the king would begin consulting political leaders from both sides of the linguistic divide this week .
leterme 's government apparently crumbled after failing to find common ground on a reform plan before the prime minister 's self-imposed july 15 deadline .
a contributing factor was the ongoing cultural differences between the dutch-speaking flemish people and the french-speaking walloons .
both sides are struggling to increase their influence in the country , with the flemish - representing some 60 percent of belgium 's 10.5 million people - demanding increased responsibilities for their territories .
in particular the reorganization of the multilingual constituency of the brussels region was under dispute .
flanders , belgium 's dutch-speaking northern half , craves more regional powers to reflect its prosperity .
it also resents subsidizing the less affluent , french-speaking wallonia region to its south .
linguistic divide splits coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluent flanders resents propping up poorer wallonia leterme said in a statement the differing views of the linguistic groups could not be reconciled at present .
" it appears that the communities ' conflicting visions of how to give a new equilibrium to our state have become incompatible , " leterme said .
but he added that " state reform remains essential " , implying that with or without him at the head of government the linguistic community issue will continue to haunt belgium .
it is the third time that the 47-year-old flemish conservative has failed to bridge the deep divisions between belgium 's flemish and french-speaking communities over whether , and how , to devolve federal powers down to them .
the government , which includes conservatives and liberals of both language groups as well as francophone socialists , has only been in power since march .
the head of the francophone conservatives , joelle milquet , earlier said she regretted leterme 's decision , and called for measures to avoid a governance crisis , according to a statement quoted by belga .
false dawn for belgian stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leterme was hospitalized during recent negotiations leterme 's resignation ushers in a new period of uncertainty , just as belgium appeared to have found some sense of stability following a six-month period in which no government could be formed after june 10 elections last year .
after the july 2007 elections , the on-going differences between dutch- and french-speaking politicians had triggered the longest government crisis in belgium 's history .
since that crisis , french speakers have agreed to enter into reform talks , realizing it was perhaps the only way to stop belgium breaking up , which almost one in two flemish speakers want , according to a recent opinion poll .
french-language parties expressed surprise tuesday that the premier had given up .
" there is a strong willingness among french parties to go deep into these reforms , " deputy premier didier reynders , who leads the french-speaking liberals , told belgium 's premiere radio .
" i think we still have time to find a solution in the hours and next few days within the framework of what we already have , " he said .
" otherwise we 'll have to look for something else . "
" the king now has to be given time to consult a number of people , " reynders said .
" it 's far too early to say what will happen next . "
uncertainty returns to politically blighted kingdom the question of what will happen next was on most people 's minds .

a new caretaker government could also be installed .
in this tense climate , no one wants early elections , according to analysts , and indeed the problem needs to be resolved if it is to avoid boosting fringe parties in the fast-approaching regional elections in june next year .

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : pro & contra : sudanese president wanted for genocide disputed international criminal court marks 10-year anniversary european leaders urge sudan to respect icc decision africa -pipe- 15.07.2008 opinion : bashir arrest warrant both symbolic and important großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the call for an arrest warrant against sudanese president omar al-bashir may just be a symbolic move , but bashir and his cronies will still have to react to the genocide charges , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court , luis moreno-ocampo , has brought out the heavy guns in asking the court for an arrest warrant for sudanese president omar hassan al-bashir .
his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .
and the chinese will not want to forgo their continuing lucrative business with sudan . stefanie duckstein -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this common -lrb- security -rrb- heritage can not survive if one of the sides destroys isolated elements of the strategic construction , " medvedev said in the sharply-worded speech which had echoes of vladimir putin at his most beligerent .
" we are unsatisfied … national security can not be based on spoken promises .
" these installations ... only worsen the situation , " he added .
" we will be forced to respond to this adequately .
the eu and us have been warned . "

russia 's top military brass resent these moves as a continuation of the united states ' cold war policy of containment .
the defeat of the conventional armed forces treaty in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- which provided for the monitoring of russian troop movements has set european defense experts on edge .
" we would not like to think that only -lrb- the treaty 's -rrb- final collapse would prove to everyone that the existing security regime is ineffective and unfair , " medvedev said .
missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .

prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .

missile shield worsening european defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice , with russia 's foreign minister sergei lavrov moscow says us missile defense plans for poland and the czech republic undermine its nuclear deterrent and that washington has failed to convince it of the system 's necessity to protect against threats from " rogue states " such as iran .
" we firmly declare that the deployment of elements of a us global anti-missile system in eastern europe only worsens the situation .
we will be forced to react in kind to this threat , " medvedev said .
last week the czech republic agreed to host radar installations for the planned us missile defense system , sparking an angry reaction from moscow .
russia attacks west 's control of smaller states medvedev also attacked western " paternalism " , accusing russia 's former cold war foes of making decisions for less powerful nations .
" with the end of the cold war , there is no reason to have a bloc mentality .
there is also no reason for paternalism , where some countries decide everything for others , " medvedev said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovars celebrate the us as a supporter of independence medvedev also criticized kosovo 's western-backed independence declaration and likened the situation there to iraq .
" for the eu , kosovo is almost what iraq is to the united states .
this is the latest example of the undermining of international law , " he added .
moscow says kosovo 's self-rule is illegal since the region 's independence was not condoned by serbia , a traditional russian ally .
the united states and a number of european nations have recognized kosovo 's independence despite protests from russia and serbia .
on a more conciliatory note , medvedev told the group of diplomats that they should refrain from cold war-style confrontation in international affairs .
" we have to defend our national interests correctly and without confrontation , " he said .
medvedev following putin 's path of assertiveness medvedev 's comments suggested he would maintain the assertive stance of his predecessor vladimir putin , now prime minister , who as president often lashed out at western policies in moscow 's former soviet-era sphere of influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev is steering russia on to a similar course as putin did his speech at the foreign ministry conference , an event held every two years , was also billed by officials as bolstering his credentials on foreign policy amid assertions by analysts that putin still wields a major role .
prior to medvedev 's inauguration in may , some western observers had expressed hope that the new russian leader might adopt a more conciliatory posture in international affairs than putin .
but since becoming president , medvedev has set about asserting russia 's position as the powerful neighbor on europe 's doorstep and protecting its interests on the international stage by flexing its considerable political and military muscle . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 15.07.2008 berlin exhibitions explore ancient art and civilizations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ancient babylonian artworks are currently on display in the pergamon in berlin berlin hosts two special exhibitions exploring the art and culture of the lucani tribe from ancient italy and the babylonians .
both detail the intricacies and complexities of two very advanced civilizations . richly painted 2,500-year-old tombs unearthed in paestum , south of pompeii , since the late 19th century are a major attraction in berlin .
for three months , visitors to the martin gropius building will be able to view the ancient art of the lucani , an italian tribe who seized the earlier greek colony of paestum in about 500 bc .
the temple ruins remain a tourist attraction today .
the berlin exhibition , earlier shown in hamburg , is entitled " paintings for eternity : the tombs of paestum . "
the lucani painted the insides of stone tombs to illustrate the lives and deaths of the deceased and their journey into the after- life .
when the funeral rites were over , the graves were sealed .
so they remained until the late 19th century when the paestum treasures were discovered by farm workers plowing the land , and archaeologists arrived to carry out excavations .
the five slabs making up most such tombs went into the paestum museum , the museo archeologico nazionale di paestum , but were never able to be grouped because the floors in the building were not strong enough to carry so much stone at one spot .
under an art-loan arrangement , the painted slabs arrived in germany last year on tour .
at the gropius building , they have been juxtaposed in their original groups .
no easy task , given that a complete tomb can weigh 43 tons .
italy 's president giorgio napolitano and germany 's parliamentary speaker , norbert lammert , are the patrons of the germany tour .
ornate tombs a prize exhibit at the show is the tomb of the black knight .
one fresco depicts a knight on a black horse whose eyes are riveted on a large pot containing a blossom , representing his dead wife .
she is also portrayed by the artist on her death bed , covered with a shroud .
the tomb is further illustrated by paintings of mourning women beating their breasts and tearing at their hair , while a sphinx waits , claw raised , ready to take the dead person into the after-life .
also to be seen are a rich assortment of ceramics linked to the lucani graves .
the 1-metre-high aphrodite vase depicts a goddess dancing in a vaporous white dress , surrounded by decorative swirls , flowers and leaves .
the exhibition also shows depictions of the ancient temples of paestum in the visual arts between 1750 and 1850 , including oil paintings , water colors and work by the italian engraver , giovanni battista piranese -lrb- 1720-78 -rrb- .
babylon exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the statues of babylon hint at the city 's ancient power running concurrently with the lucani treasures show is " babylon : myth and truth , " an exhibition at the pergamon museum on the city 's island of museums .
for centuries biblical images have portrayed babylon , or babel , as a metaphor for the eternal apocalypse , reflecting violence , repression , licentiousness and decadence , with images evoking the dark side of civilization .
such images have dominated public thinking for centuries .
historically , however , there is little truth in the myth , according to the show 's promotional brochure entitled , " no whores .
no tower .
no king .
no god . "
for 150 years archaeologists have been researching the remains of babylon , once one of the most powerful cities of the ancient world and partly a source of western culture .
the museum , the british museum and the louvre have cooperated to assemble the babylon treasures into a traveling show , so that tourists do not need to visit berlin , london and paris to see the full range .
history not legend using a unique selection of statues , reliefs , votive offerings , architectural elements and ancient writings , the historical findings have been carefully distinguished from the legendary version , as berlin critic klaus grimberg explained in a recent review .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors walk through the impressive ishtar gate at the heart of the chapter on " truth " are two structures brought entire to berlin a century ago , the ishtar gate and the processional way of babylon .
babylon , located about 90 kilometers south of today 's baghdad , was ruled by kings such as hammurabi -lrb- 1792-1750 bc -rrb- and nebuchadnezzar and was a state for almost two millennia .
far from being a cauldron of sin , linguistic confusion and godlessness , the city was a centre of learning and science , as clay tablets , minutely inscribed in cuneiform , testify .
babylonians , according to historians , were the first to divide an hour into 60 minutes , a year into 12 months and a circle into 360 degrees .
city of learning , not sin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit tries to dispel the myth of an evil babylon scale models in the " reality " part of the exhibition confirm that babylon did indeed have a tower , but that it was a modest one compared to artists ' later depictions of a " colossal edifice " designed to touch the heavens and challenge god 's authority .
in biblical terms , babylon - in contrast to heavenly jerusalem - became a metaphor for an evil empire .
the new testament book of revelations spoke of " the whore of babylon " and in the early 16th century , german protestant reformer martin luther used the term to revile catholic rome .
what the berlin exhibition seeks to do is shed some light on this ancient conundrum by separating myths from historical reality .
the babylon : myth and reality exhibition continues until october 5 at the pergamon , while the painting for eternity : tombs of paestum show at the martin gropius building is to be seen until september 28 . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all products made from cat and dog pelts , including clothing , blankets , toys and key chains , will be affected by the ban , which takes effect on ebay 's sites in germany , austria and switzerland .
the company explained that while cats and dogs are not protected animal species , they are often killed inhumanely for their fur .
ebay said it wanted to raise awareness of the practice among its members , and protect them from unknowingly purchasing products made with cat and dog pelts .
company spokesman witt said that the ban would be extended to other european countries such as france , italy and spain .

his reason : the campaign of genocide in the darfur region .
in addition , ocampo cited evidence that the president is guilty of 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it 's a brave step for ocampo , but one that will likely not put the government in khartoum under as much pressure as one would wish .
despite this , it is a symbolic and long-overdue move .
up to now , the position of the international community has been rather cloudy .
the bloody massacre of the sudanese people has made for shocking headlines for years now , but clearly not shocking enough to take any action with consequences .
any past attempts to put a stop to the murder in darfur have ended in failure , and any political solutions to the crisis have been blatantly ignored by bashir .
the united nations could n't bring it upon itself to impose economic sanctions .
and military measures ?
a farce .
the chinese are flouting a weapons embargo and diligently delivering ammunition , equipment and training for sudanese soldiers .
un general secretary ban ki-moon had to practically beg troop donor nations for the joint peace mission made up of soldiers from the un and the african union , with the result that today , not even a third of the planned 26,000 soldiers have actually arrived in darfur .
making matters worse - the un troops have no mandate to disarm the black african rebels or the janjaweed militia .
so far , there have been nothing but helpless attempts to bring an end to the crisis , now in its fifth year .
ocampo 's offensive is all the more remarkable , because for the first time in its 10 year history , the icc has charged a sitting head of state .
it shows that top-ranking politicians - even national leaders - are not immune to criminal proceedings when they are guilty of human rights violations .
past charges do n't bode well but two previous arrest warrants show how much bite - or rather , how little bite - the charges against bashir will have .
the icc has already brought charges against two alleged sudanese war criminals , but the long arm of international criminal law is n't long enough .
khartoum refused to extradite the men and even appointed one of the accused , ahmad harun , minister for humanitarian affairs .
a slap in the face for anyone with a sense of justice .
this push from the hague , then , is unlikely to result in any more security for the people of darfur .
sudan refuses to recognize the icc , and bashir can continue to count on the support of his friends .
the african union has already warned of the risk associated with putting the sudanese leader on trial .
and the chinese will not want to forgo their continuing lucrative business with sudan . stefanie duckstein -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- approval of the plan is a key condition for putting into effect a nuclear deal between india and us .
left-wing parties in india have pulled out of the governing coalition in protest against the deal .
the government says it is needed to meet soaring energy demands .
india is under pressure from washington to sign the accord before the us presidential elections in november .
india has to sign a " safeguards agreement " with the iaea before it can go ahead with the deal .
the agreement will open up india 's key civilian nuclear reactors to un inspections .
if the iaea signs the agreement , the deal will go to the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group , which regulates global civilian nuclear trade , for approval .
" a -lsb- special -rsb- meeting of the -lsb- 35-nation -rsb- iaea board of governors will take place on 1 august with the india safeguards agreement on the agenda , " melissa fleming , spokeswoman for the vienna-based iaea said .
controversial she said india would brief the iaea 's board of governors on this friday .
a restricted draft of india 's plans for safeguarding nuclear facilities has been given to iaea 's 35 member nations ahead of the meeting .
some critics who have seen the draft have said several points in it appear to restrict international monitoring of india 's atomic programme .
the us had restricted nuclear co-operation with india - which has not signed the 1972 non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - since it first tested a nuclear weapon in 1974 .
under the terms of the nuclear accord , india would get access to us civilian nuclear technology and fuel .
nuclear power in india india has 14 reactors in commercial operation and nine under construction nuclear power supplies about 3 % of india 's electricity by 2050 , nuclear power is expected to provide 25 % of the country 's electricity india has limited coal and uranium reserves its huge thorium reserves - about 25 % of the world 's total - are expected to fuel its nuclear power programme long-term source : uranium information center in return , delhi would open its civilian nuclear facilities to inspection - but its nuclear weapons sites would remain off-limits .
critics of the deal fear assistance to india 's civil programme could free-up additional radioactive material for bomb-making purposes .
meanwhile , left-wing parties in india have launched a national campaign against the nuclear deal .
the governing coalition , which has now been reduced to a minority after their communist allies withdrew support , will seek a vote of confidence on 22 july .
if the government loses the vote , india faces early elections and the nuclear deal would probably be scuttled .

india is under pressure from washington to sign the accord before the us presidential elections in november .
india has to sign a " safeguards agreement " with the iaea before it can go ahead with the deal .
the agreement will open up india 's key civilian nuclear reactors to un inspections .
if the iaea signs the agreement , the deal will go to the 45-nation nuclear suppliers group , which regulates global civilian nuclear trade , for approval .
" a -lsb- special -rsb- meeting of the -lsb- 35-nation -rsb- iaea board of governors will take place on 1 august with the india safeguards agreement on the agenda , " melissa fleming , spokeswoman for the vienna-based iaea said .

the governing coalition , which has now been reduced to a minority after their communist allies withdrew support , will seek a vote of confidence on 22 july .
if the government loses the vote , india faces early elections and the nuclear deal would probably be scuttled .
