program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.04.2008 poland makes it easy to be german , tv star says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeller has lived in poland for 14 years recent high-level meetings between berlin and warsaw have prompted speculation about a new european alliance .
dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.04.2008 poland makes it easy to be german , tv star says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeller has lived in poland for 14 years recent high-level meetings between berlin and warsaw have prompted speculation about a new european alliance .
dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .
at family celebrations , she hears time and time again how lucky she is to be a student .
but mareike says she feels anything but happy .
psychosomatic illness on the rise her problems began when she finished secondary school and made the transition to university .
she suffered from psychosomatic stomach and intestinal complaints .
but , she put it all down to her diet and decided to change her eating habits .
when this did n't help matters , her psychological problems got worse .
shortly before finishing her bachelor 's degree , her physical symptoms become too much to bear .
in addition to her stomach and intestinal problems , she also started experiencing difficulties in breathing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are under pressure to spend fewer years at university like many others , mareike failed to attribute her health problems to the strain she was feeling from her studies .
" somehow , you just ca n't accept that there 's something wrong with your body , " she said .
" you think there has to be some sort of disease behind it , because this feeling is just so real . "
mareike sought out different doctors , and underwent a battery of tests .
only when specialists had ruled out all physical causes did she allow herself to think that the cause could be psychological .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 20.04.2008 stressed-out students turning to drugs , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say uncomfortable , overfilled lecture halls are just one problem students face germany 's new bachelor 's and master 's courses are whittling away the time students devote to their degrees .
but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .
at family celebrations , she hears time and time again how lucky she is to be a student .
but mareike says she feels anything but happy .
psychosomatic illness on the rise her problems began when she finished secondary school and made the transition to university .
she suffered from psychosomatic stomach and intestinal complaints .
but , she put it all down to her diet and decided to change her eating habits .
when this did n't help matters , her psychological problems got worse .
shortly before finishing her bachelor 's degree , her physical symptoms become too much to bear .
in addition to her stomach and intestinal problems , she also started experiencing difficulties in breathing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are under pressure to spend fewer years at university like many others , mareike failed to attribute her health problems to the strain she was feeling from her studies .
" somehow , you just ca n't accept that there 's something wrong with your body , " she said .
" you think there has to be some sort of disease behind it , because this feeling is just so real . "
mareike sought out different doctors , and underwent a battery of tests .
only when specialists had ruled out all physical causes did she allow herself to think that the cause could be psychological .
it 's not just the sufferer who has trouble identifying the cause of their problems .
often , doctors do n't realize how much stress the student is under , so they look for other causes in what can be a long , painful process .
students increasingly look to alcohol , drugs it 's no wonder , then , that more and more students reach for a " quick fix " in the form of alcohol .

but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .
at family celebrations , she hears time and time again how lucky she is to be a student .
but mareike says she feels anything but happy .
psychosomatic illness on the rise her problems began when she finished secondary school and made the transition to university .
she suffered from psychosomatic stomach and intestinal complaints .
but , she put it all down to her diet and decided to change her eating habits .
when this did n't help matters , her psychological problems got worse .
shortly before finishing her bachelor 's degree , her physical symptoms become too much to bear .

mareike sought out different doctors , and underwent a battery of tests .

students increasingly look to alcohol , drugs it 's no wonder , then , that more and more students reach for a " quick fix " in the form of alcohol .
a study by the university of muenster found that every third university student has a problem with alcohol .
cannabis consumption is also on the rise , and while the normal german worker takes anti-depressant medication on an average of 3.5 days a year , the average dose for students is five days .
attempts to relax and escape the pressure of competition are becoming ever more dangerous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say more students are looking to alcohol as a way to relax experts are increasingly warning about the link between studying and stress .
the public health insurance fund techniker , together with the university of bielefeld , carried out a survey of 3,300 students that came to shocking conclusions .
sixteen percent of those polled reported feeling depressed , and every fourth student said they suffered from excessive neck and back pain and / or had difficulty concentrating .

social democrats and opposition politicians are concerned . opposition is growing against the government 's plans to expand germany 's anti-terror legislation .
top social democratic legal expert klaus-uwe benneter called the bill a " collection of barbarities out of all the states ' police legislation , " in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper over the weekend . " the last word has not yet been spoken , " he warned , saying that the bill would be closely scrutinized . the amended anti-terror legislation would allow the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- to plant bugs and video cameras and secretly record activities not merely in the homes of terror suspects , but also in those of people they associate with .
some politicians are worried that innocent and unsuspicious people will end up being targeted and their civil rights abused . interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a christian democrat , and justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , have agreed on the bill , known as the bka law .
a cabinet decision is expected this summer .
constitutional or no ?
zypries defended the plans on sunday , april 20 . " we looked very carefully at the rules in the bka law , it was in line with the constitution , " she said in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and zypries are in agreement over the bill however , opposition politicians expressed skepticism . the free democratic party 's domestic affairs expert , max stadler , said employing hidden cameras in private homes was " constitutionally very questionable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.04.2008 poland makes it easy to be german , tv star says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeller has lived in poland for 14 years recent high-level meetings between berlin and warsaw have prompted speculation about a new european alliance .
dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.04.2008 poland makes it easy to be german , tv star says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeller has lived in poland for 14 years recent high-level meetings between berlin and warsaw have prompted speculation about a new european alliance .
dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .

that 's why human rights defenders are demanding improvements for getting legal compensation abroad . when international corporations start mining resources in developing countries , both pollution and human rights abuses are frequently the result , according to michael windfuhr of the german protestant church 's social aid organization , diakonisches werk .
people suffer alongside the environment when the ground is dirtied by oil spills , such as in the niger delta , or when ancient-growth forests are in danger of being cleared , as in south america . and most people generally find it hard to defend themselves , windfuhr said . " that often has to do with them having very few resources themselves , often being illiterate , having difficulty documenting their cases , lacking money - both for lawyers and the trip to the district court - and lacking knowledge of their own rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamond prospectors in congo it would make little difference if windfuhr and other human rights activists acted as the victims ' lawyers .
in many countries , expeditious and fair legal proceedings that can bring about change simply are n't possible because there is no rule of law .
congo is an example , said windfuhr . " you do n't have a chance if you want to take a case to court there , " he said . that makes it all the more important for victims to be able to stand up for their rights if they 're faced with an abusive german logging company or diamond exporter , for example .
but that 's still far from reality , according to windfuhr . " the german government has not been very active so far , but rather , mainly protects the interests of german investors abroad , " he said .
" that is the government 's paramount legal interest . " taking cases abroad though the us alien tort claims act allows people to sue foreign companies in the united states for human rights violations that occurred abroad , there 's still no legal basis for such claims in germany or the rest of europe . furthermore , it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for human rights abuses , with subcontractors from numerous countries often making up the parts of a complex production chain .

after five years of negotiations , and despite resistance from britain , canada and the us , the council members have agreed on a complaints process for the victims of human rights violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.04.2008 poland makes it easy to be german , tv star says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeller has lived in poland for 14 years recent high-level meetings between berlin and warsaw have prompted speculation about a new european alliance .
dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .

dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?

they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .

i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?

social democrats and opposition politicians are concerned . opposition is growing against the government 's plans to expand germany 's anti-terror legislation .
top social democratic legal expert klaus-uwe benneter called the bill a " collection of barbarities out of all the states ' police legislation , " in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper over the weekend . " the last word has not yet been spoken , " he warned , saying that the bill would be closely scrutinized . the amended anti-terror legislation would allow the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- to plant bugs and video cameras and secretly record activities not merely in the homes of terror suspects , but also in those of people they associate with .
some politicians are worried that innocent and unsuspicious people will end up being targeted and their civil rights abused . interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a christian democrat , and justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , have agreed on the bill , known as the bka law .
a cabinet decision is expected this summer .
constitutional or no ?
zypries defended the plans on sunday , april 20 . " we looked very carefully at the rules in the bka law , it was in line with the constitution , " she said in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and zypries are in agreement over the bill however , opposition politicians expressed skepticism . the free democratic party 's domestic affairs expert , max stadler , said employing hidden cameras in private homes was " constitutionally very questionable . " top green party parliamentarian renate kuenast told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the bill posed a threat to people 's civil rights . the left party domestic expert , petra pau , was also critical : " anyone who wants to know and control everything , has departed from the foundation of the constitution .

dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .

you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .

dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?

nearly two years ago , he helped italy beat france to win the world cup in the same stadium . after the game at the olympiastadion saturday night , toni lifted the german cup , and later told german television : " it 's incredible here , " speaking about the german capital . bayern munich fans are likely to say that toni 's dazzling performance was just as incredible . bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , at any rate , could hardly contain his enthusiasm for toni . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , what a feeling : toni hugs goalkeeper kahn -lrb- far right -rrb- after the dfb pokal win " he 's a world-class striker , " he told reuters news agency .
" he 's got an amazing instinct for goals .
he 's always believing he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . " with 35 goals in 41 matches in all competitions , toni has chalked up much of the tally for bayern of late .
he may also be the one to help the team recover from last season 's fourth place league finish with a record three titles this season . " it 's always good to win titles , " toni said .
" we 've won the german cup and now we want to win the bundesliga championship and then get the triple with the uefa cup , " he said saturday . " i really wanted to lift this german cup .
it 's my first national cup , " he said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a cabinet decision is expected this summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 20.04.2008 euro 2008 co-hosts clear championship hurdles - mostly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally , the swiss border would hold up eu citizens used to free travel hosting a major international sports event always presents the organizers with a unique set of challenges .
when an event is shared , the problems can sometimes double - just ask euro 2008 hosts austria and switzerland . even in the case of the european soccer championships , an event which takes place every four years , no single blueprint for success can be applied to every nation .
every host country faces its own set of problems arising from its geographical , cultural and social situation . when an event takes place spread over two countries , those difficulties take on a more complex nature . one of the major problems concerning the collaboration and cooperation between the two euro 2008 host nations is that austria is a member of the european union and switzerland is not . the last european championship to be shared between countries , the 2000 tournament in belgium and the netherlands , also had problems arising from such an arrangement : the single currency was still two years away , meaning fans had to change money between countries .
though full implementation of the schengen free movement agreement allowed hassle-free travel between the host nations . fans wanting to follow their teams in austria and switzerland would normally face these same difficulties and more .
as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any of the bloc 's cooperation agreements in border security and policing and still uses the swiss franc as its currency . because switzerland is not a member of the schengen agreement , those traveling to the finals this summer with the intention of visiting both host countries would have needed to get two visas .
despite an agreement which allows the free movement of goods into switzerland from the eu , the stricter provisions in the schengen treaty do not contain any exemption with respect to switzerland . visa deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu approved the plans for a special switzerland visa however , while sharing the host duties can sometimes increase the potential for disaster , the old adage of two heads being better than one also applies .
add some more heads willing to come up with answers and even the most complicated of matters can be solved through cooperation . a new simplified visa process was agreed at a meeting last year involving christoph blocher , switzerland 's then head of the federal council , austrian interior minister guenther platter , his german counterpart wolfgang schaeuble , and the foreign minister of liechtenstein , rita kieber-beck . the meeting led to an agreement which will make it possible to travel in both austria and switzerland with a single visa for the duration of the tournament . " the temporary visa operation will allow fans from participating countries that are part of the schengen agreement to travel freely in switzerland , " konrad kogler from the austrian interior ministry told dw-world.de. " the joint delegations have held extensive negotiations with the european union on this topic and were given approval .
a contract had to be signed between the schengen nations and switzerland to allow this temporary visa arrangement . " visitors will only have to apply for a visa in austria , while switzerland will explore whether there are any fernhaltegruende or reasons to deny them entry .
providing that is not the case , the holder of a schengen visa will receive a special additional euro 2008 stamp that will allow them to cross the austrian-swiss border without any difficulties . joint border patrols the border the fans will cross also cause headaches .
while the visa will allow fans to enter switzerland easier , the border will remain one between a non-eu country and an eu member state , meaning that it will still have controls .
who operates those controls was also a matter of discussion , negotiation and agreement . " with problems like these , arising from the fact that one country is part of the eu and the other is not , collaboration and cooperation is key , " said kogler .
" that is why , in regard to the border , there is also a temporary agreement in place for the championships where border controls will be manned by mixed teams from both countries . " bildunterschrift : an eu police collaboration will ease swiss burdens questions have also arisen over the wider implications for shared security .
european union countries are subject to agreements signed in brussels which allow cross-border cooperation in policing .
again , as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any security agreement , although the austrians and swiss have made an arrangement for euro 2008 . " in terms of policing , there are cooperation and collaboration centers in every host city in each country , " kogler said .
" there are liaison officers from austria in the swiss centers and vice versa .
there will not be any large deployments of police in each other 's country .
while this is not really an eu issue , it is a european policing issue , so there will also be officers from countries contributing to the frontex external border security agency operating in both austria and switzerland during the tournament . " european cops assist in swiss security last year , the swiss federal council approved a request for support from beyond the co-host 's borders made by a combined committee of regional police forces , after it became clear that the swiss police force would be over-stretched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be deployed in both nations although no " high-risk " games will take place in switzerland , the help is needed as eight countries , including the co-hosts , will be based in the nation , and a high number of visitors are expected . as a result of this agreement german officers will be deployed in host cities basel and zurich during the championships , and french police will be stationed in geneva .
the german police will also have a presence in austria . a question of currency however , once safely through the border controls into the well-policed cities of switzerland , most fans will still be faced with another problem : dealing with a different currency .
those from euro-zone countries will still be confronted with the constant need to change money . while not all the participating countries use the euro , fans from those which do n't will have extra problems : changing their own currency not only into the euro for use in austria but also into the franc for switzerland . no solution has yet been found to ease the potential problem of thousands of fans dealing with two currencies during the championships . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de world cup ticket lessons go unheeded at euro 2008 massive numbers of germany fans have been clamoring for euro 2008 tickets since the lottery process started in earnest .
unfortunately , just like at the 2006 world cup , demand will outstrip supply by far .

when an event is shared , the problems can sometimes double - just ask euro 2008 hosts austria and switzerland . even in the case of the european soccer championships , an event which takes place every four years , no single blueprint for success can be applied to every nation .
every host country faces its own set of problems arising from its geographical , cultural and social situation . when an event takes place spread over two countries , those difficulties take on a more complex nature . one of the major problems concerning the collaboration and cooperation between the two euro 2008 host nations is that austria is a member of the european union and switzerland is not . the last european championship to be shared between countries , the 2000 tournament in belgium and the netherlands , also had problems arising from such an arrangement : the single currency was still two years away , meaning fans had to change money between countries .
though full implementation of the schengen free movement agreement allowed hassle-free travel between the host nations . fans wanting to follow their teams in austria and switzerland would normally face these same difficulties and more .
as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any of the bloc 's cooperation agreements in border security and policing and still uses the swiss franc as its currency . because switzerland is not a member of the schengen agreement , those traveling to the finals this summer with the intention of visiting both host countries would have needed to get two visas .
despite an agreement which allows the free movement of goods into switzerland from the eu , the stricter provisions in the schengen treaty do not contain any exemption with respect to switzerland . visa deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu approved the plans for a special switzerland visa however , while sharing the host duties can sometimes increase the potential for disaster , the old adage of two heads being better than one also applies .
add some more heads willing to come up with answers and even the most complicated of matters can be solved through cooperation . a new simplified visa process was agreed at a meeting last year involving christoph blocher , switzerland 's then head of the federal council , austrian interior minister guenther platter , his german counterpart wolfgang schaeuble , and the foreign minister of liechtenstein , rita kieber-beck . the meeting led to an agreement which will make it possible to travel in both austria and switzerland with a single visa for the duration of the tournament . " the temporary visa operation will allow fans from participating countries that are part of the schengen agreement to travel freely in switzerland , " konrad kogler from the austrian interior ministry told dw-world.de. " the joint delegations have held extensive negotiations with the european union on this topic and were given approval .
a contract had to be signed between the schengen nations and switzerland to allow this temporary visa arrangement . " visitors will only have to apply for a visa in austria , while switzerland will explore whether there are any fernhaltegruende or reasons to deny them entry .
providing that is not the case , the holder of a schengen visa will receive a special additional euro 2008 stamp that will allow them to cross the austrian-swiss border without any difficulties . joint border patrols the border the fans will cross also cause headaches .
while the visa will allow fans to enter switzerland easier , the border will remain one between a non-eu country and an eu member state , meaning that it will still have controls .
who operates those controls was also a matter of discussion , negotiation and agreement . " with problems like these , arising from the fact that one country is part of the eu and the other is not , collaboration and cooperation is key , " said kogler .
" that is why , in regard to the border , there is also a temporary agreement in place for the championships where border controls will be manned by mixed teams from both countries . " bildunterschrift : an eu police collaboration will ease swiss burdens questions have also arisen over the wider implications for shared security .
european union countries are subject to agreements signed in brussels which allow cross-border cooperation in policing .
again , as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any security agreement , although the austrians and swiss have made an arrangement for euro 2008 . " in terms of policing , there are cooperation and collaboration centers in every host city in each country , " kogler said .
" there are liaison officers from austria in the swiss centers and vice versa .
there will not be any large deployments of police in each other 's country .
while this is not really an eu issue , it is a european policing issue , so there will also be officers from countries contributing to the frontex external border security agency operating in both austria and switzerland during the tournament . " european cops assist in swiss security last year , the swiss federal council approved a request for support from beyond the co-host 's borders made by a combined committee of regional police forces , after it became clear that the swiss police force would be over-stretched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be deployed in both nations although no " high-risk " games will take place in switzerland , the help is needed as eight countries , including the co-hosts , will be based in the nation , and a high number of visitors are expected . as a result of this agreement german officers will be deployed in host cities basel and zurich during the championships , and french police will be stationed in geneva .
the german police will also have a presence in austria . a question of currency however , once safely through the border controls into the well-policed cities of switzerland , most fans will still be faced with another problem : dealing with a different currency .
those from euro-zone countries will still be confronted with the constant need to change money . while not all the participating countries use the euro , fans from those which do n't will have extra problems : changing their own currency not only into the euro for use in austria but also into the franc for switzerland . no solution has yet been found to ease the potential problem of thousands of fans dealing with two currencies during the championships . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's why human rights defenders are demanding improvements for getting legal compensation abroad . when international corporations start mining resources in developing countries , both pollution and human rights abuses are frequently the result , according to michael windfuhr of the german protestant church 's social aid organization , diakonisches werk .
people suffer alongside the environment when the ground is dirtied by oil spills , such as in the niger delta , or when ancient-growth forests are in danger of being cleared , as in south america . and most people generally find it hard to defend themselves , windfuhr said . " that often has to do with them having very few resources themselves , often being illiterate , having difficulty documenting their cases , lacking money - both for lawyers and the trip to the district court - and lacking knowledge of their own rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diamond prospectors in congo it would make little difference if windfuhr and other human rights activists acted as the victims ' lawyers .
in many countries , expeditious and fair legal proceedings that can bring about change simply are n't possible because there is no rule of law .
congo is an example , said windfuhr . " you do n't have a chance if you want to take a case to court there , " he said . that makes it all the more important for victims to be able to stand up for their rights if they 're faced with an abusive german logging company or diamond exporter , for example .
but that 's still far from reality , according to windfuhr . " the german government has not been very active so far , but rather , mainly protects the interests of german investors abroad , " he said .
" that is the government 's paramount legal interest . " taking cases abroad though the us alien tort claims act allows people to sue foreign companies in the united states for human rights violations that occurred abroad , there 's still no legal basis for such claims in germany or the rest of europe . furthermore , it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for human rights abuses , with subcontractors from numerous countries often making up the parts of a complex production chain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : years will pass before the displaced can complain to the un however , observers are expecting a breakthrough in the united nation 's human rights council .
after five years of negotiations , and despite resistance from britain , canada and the us , the council members have agreed on a complaints process for the victims of human rights violations .
it allows claimants to file a complaint with the united nations against states .
the complaints procedure was previously limited to civil rights issues and the women 's rights convention . but , it will still be some time before the first group of people can bring their human rights claims to the un .
the human rights council and the un general assembly must first approve the treaty and present it for ratification .
and , years can pass before enough states have ratified it for it to come into effect . nevertheless , human rights organizations and ngos in germany are already expecting it to send a clear message to national courts .
until that happens , though , the only thing to do is carefully document human rights violations - and make them public . ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.04.2008 poland makes it easy to be german , tv star says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeller has lived in poland for 14 years recent high-level meetings between berlin and warsaw have prompted speculation about a new european alliance .
dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

social democrats and opposition politicians are concerned . opposition is growing against the government 's plans to expand germany 's anti-terror legislation .
top social democratic legal expert klaus-uwe benneter called the bill a " collection of barbarities out of all the states ' police legislation , " in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper over the weekend . " the last word has not yet been spoken , " he warned , saying that the bill would be closely scrutinized . the amended anti-terror legislation would allow the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- to plant bugs and video cameras and secretly record activities not merely in the homes of terror suspects , but also in those of people they associate with .
some politicians are worried that innocent and unsuspicious people will end up being targeted and their civil rights abused . interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a christian democrat , and justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , have agreed on the bill , known as the bka law .
a cabinet decision is expected this summer .
constitutional or no ?
zypries defended the plans on sunday , april 20 . " we looked very carefully at the rules in the bka law , it was in line with the constitution , " she said in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and zypries are in agreement over the bill however , opposition politicians expressed skepticism . the free democratic party 's domestic affairs expert , max stadler , said employing hidden cameras in private homes was " constitutionally very questionable .

but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .
at family celebrations , she hears time and time again how lucky she is to be a student .
but mareike says she feels anything but happy .
psychosomatic illness on the rise her problems began when she finished secondary school and made the transition to university .
she suffered from psychosomatic stomach and intestinal complaints .
but , she put it all down to her diet and decided to change her eating habits .
when this did n't help matters , her psychological problems got worse .
shortly before finishing her bachelor 's degree , her physical symptoms become too much to bear .
in addition to her stomach and intestinal problems , she also started experiencing difficulties in breathing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are under pressure to spend fewer years at university like many others , mareike failed to attribute her health problems to the strain she was feeling from her studies .
" somehow , you just ca n't accept that there 's something wrong with your body , " she said .
" you think there has to be some sort of disease behind it , because this feeling is just so real . "
mareike sought out different doctors , and underwent a battery of tests .
only when specialists had ruled out all physical causes did she allow herself to think that the cause could be psychological .
it 's not just the sufferer who has trouble identifying the cause of their problems .
often , doctors do n't realize how much stress the student is under , so they look for other causes in what can be a long , painful process .

social democrats and opposition politicians are concerned . opposition is growing against the government 's plans to expand germany 's anti-terror legislation .
top social democratic legal expert klaus-uwe benneter called the bill a " collection of barbarities out of all the states ' police legislation , " in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper over the weekend . " the last word has not yet been spoken , " he warned , saying that the bill would be closely scrutinized . the amended anti-terror legislation would allow the federal crime office -lrb- bka -rrb- to plant bugs and video cameras and secretly record activities not merely in the homes of terror suspects , but also in those of people they associate with .
some politicians are worried that innocent and unsuspicious people will end up being targeted and their civil rights abused . interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , a christian democrat , and justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , have agreed on the bill , known as the bka law .
a cabinet decision is expected this summer .
constitutional or no ?
zypries defended the plans on sunday , april 20 . " we looked very carefully at the rules in the bka law , it was in line with the constitution , " she said in an interview with die welt am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble and zypries are in agreement over the bill however , opposition politicians expressed skepticism . the free democratic party 's domestic affairs expert , max stadler , said employing hidden cameras in private homes was " constitutionally very questionable . " top green party parliamentarian renate kuenast told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the bill posed a threat to people 's civil rights . the left party domestic expert , petra pau , was also critical : " anyone who wants to know and control everything , has departed from the foundation of the constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 20.04.2008 stressed-out students turning to drugs , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say uncomfortable , overfilled lecture halls are just one problem students face germany 's new bachelor 's and master 's courses are whittling away the time students devote to their degrees .
but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .
at family celebrations , she hears time and time again how lucky she is to be a student .
but mareike says she feels anything but happy .
psychosomatic illness on the rise her problems began when she finished secondary school and made the transition to university .
she suffered from psychosomatic stomach and intestinal complaints .
but , she put it all down to her diet and decided to change her eating habits .
when this did n't help matters , her psychological problems got worse .
shortly before finishing her bachelor 's degree , her physical symptoms become too much to bear .
in addition to her stomach and intestinal problems , she also started experiencing difficulties in breathing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are under pressure to spend fewer years at university like many others , mareike failed to attribute her health problems to the strain she was feeling from her studies .
" somehow , you just ca n't accept that there 's something wrong with your body , " she said .
" you think there has to be some sort of disease behind it , because this feeling is just so real . "
mareike sought out different doctors , and underwent a battery of tests .
only when specialists had ruled out all physical causes did she allow herself to think that the cause could be psychological .
it 's not just the sufferer who has trouble identifying the cause of their problems .
often , doctors do n't realize how much stress the student is under , so they look for other causes in what can be a long , painful process .
students increasingly look to alcohol , drugs it 's no wonder , then , that more and more students reach for a " quick fix " in the form of alcohol .
a study by the university of muenster found that every third university student has a problem with alcohol .
cannabis consumption is also on the rise , and while the normal german worker takes anti-depressant medication on an average of 3.5 days a year , the average dose for students is five days .
attempts to relax and escape the pressure of competition are becoming ever more dangerous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say more students are looking to alcohol as a way to relax experts are increasingly warning about the link between studying and stress .
the public health insurance fund techniker , together with the university of bielefeld , carried out a survey of 3,300 students that came to shocking conclusions .
sixteen percent of those polled reported feeling depressed , and every fourth student said they suffered from excessive neck and back pain and / or had difficulty concentrating .
according to techniker spokeswoman andrea kleinbreuer , there are multiple causes , from uncomfortable chairs in overfilled lecture halls , to time pressure and financial worries due to increasing tuition fees .
" students have to deal with these burdens , the pressure at universities is growing , " kleinbreuer said .
prevention is key in order to prevent students from suffering from nervous breakdowns , public health funds are developing special preventative programs for universities .
among the offerings are courses on stress-free studying .
participants learn everything from how to sit ergonomically and better manage their time , to how to relax - without turning to alcohol , drugs or medication . armin himmelrath -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly two years ago , he helped italy beat france to win the world cup in the same stadium . after the game at the olympiastadion saturday night , toni lifted the german cup , and later told german television : " it 's incredible here , " speaking about the german capital . bayern munich fans are likely to say that toni 's dazzling performance was just as incredible . bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld , at any rate , could hardly contain his enthusiasm for toni . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , what a feeling : toni hugs goalkeeper kahn -lrb- far right -rrb- after the dfb pokal win " he 's a world-class striker , " he told reuters news agency .
" he 's got an amazing instinct for goals .
he 's always believing he can score two or three goals in each match .
he 's never satisfied and always hungry for more goals .
he 's a real winner , a leader on our team . " with 35 goals in 41 matches in all competitions , toni has chalked up much of the tally for bayern of late .
he may also be the one to help the team recover from last season 's fourth place league finish with a record three titles this season . " it 's always good to win titles , " toni said .
" we 've won the german cup and now we want to win the bundesliga championship and then get the triple with the uefa cup , " he said saturday . " i really wanted to lift this german cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 20.04.2008 poland makes it easy to be german , tv star says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moeller has lived in poland for 14 years recent high-level meetings between berlin and warsaw have prompted speculation about a new european alliance .
dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the media debate in poland and germany sank to dismal depths in 2007 when jaroslaw kaczynski was prime minister , relations between berlin and warsaw were very strained .
last year , a new government took over .
do you think this marks a new chapter in german-polish relations ?
definitely .
the new prime minister , donald tusk , is trying to normalize german-polish relations .
he 's also been successful .
you can see that by the fact that poland has hardly been visible in the german media for the past few months .
it shows that everything is normal .
maybe my book sales have profited from it , since some germans think it means they can now go on holiday in poland .
of course , that 's nonsense .
germans who visit poland always expect to be confronted with the german past .
on one level that is true - but indirectly , in the sense of memorials and cemeteries .
it 's interesting , but poles treat us germans very well .
one reason is that the russians marched in after the germans and the memory of that is much stronger .
but there 's another reason .
mutual mistrust is the polish national illness .
poles ca n't stand each other .
if you travel to cracow and you want to rent an apartment and there are six poles who want to rent the apartment too , you can be sure that , as a german , you 'll get the apartment .
not because the landlord loves you , but because he does n't trust his fellow countrymen to pay the rent and the telephone .
as germans , we also profit from this economically , because we 're regarded as trustworthy and honest , as well as naive and humorless .
what would you miss , if you moved away from poland ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frontier is now relatively insignificant , the divide is not their warmth .
at christmas i got 40 text messages from people i know - some of whom i had n't seen for three years .
really long ones .
i got a single text message from a german acquaintance from my home town , wuppertal .
it simply said : " happy christmas . "
they also have an absurd sense of humor - also shared amongst strangers .
when i 'm asked by the poles whether germans have a sense of humor , i tell them : " yes , but only in the evening when they 're sitting in the cabaret and they know that they are allowed to laugh . "
i have a plumber whose visiting card says " slow , expensive and unreliable . "
i asked him whether that was meant to be an advertisement .
he told me that in poland everyone realized it was a joke and rang up for that very reason .
what could be done to further improve the state of polish-german relations ?
i think a television station should be set up .
not for reasons of political correctness .
it would be interesting to have reports from our european neighbors .
that would do a lot to cement european identity .
we could also build on what is there - expand the existing partnerships . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to one of the best-known germans in poland about relations between the countries . steffen moeller first visited poland 14 years ago on a two-week language course .
he liked it so much that he decided to return for good .
after seven years teaching german , he launched a career in cabaret and television .
while still relatively unknown in his native germany , the soap star and game show host has become a household name in poland .
the german emigrant has also written a number of books , most recently " viva polonia " - an account of his experiences living in poland and a guide to his adopted homeland .
in 2005 , he was awarded the german federal order of merit for his services to german-polish relations .
dw-world.de : were there many other germans in your situation when you arrived in poland in 1994 ?
has the situation changed at all since then ?
steffen moeller : quite a lot of germans move to poland with german firms .
but they tend to remain within these firms as managers .
i was one of the few who always had polish employers .
i do now occasionally get e-mails from germans who have moved to poland .
but i do n't think there are that many .
i think that a lot more germans go to prague or budapest .
why do you think that is ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more germans and poles are getting hitched poland and romania have the worst reputation in germany of all the european union countries .
poland 's is perhaps even worse than romania 's .
i think it 's linked to the fact that poland is germany 's second biggest neighbor .
the relationship to france , our largest neighbor has , as is well known , not always been good .
that changed after the second world war , because west germany was part of the western bloc .
relations with poland have only been normal for the past few years .
there is an awful lot of catching up to do .
and , of course , there is a much bigger difference in the standard of living on the eastern german border .
many germans have only come across poles working in polish markets and bazaars … and a lot of polish car thieves .
but that is becoming less and less of a problem , because the gap is closing .
the divide between the germanic peoples and the slavs that bisects germany and poland is probably a lot bigger than that between the germanic peoples and the romanic peoples .
the reasons for that go back a very long way .
the germans were always fixated on the west .
my brother lives in paris .
he tells me that the french have the same relationship to germany as germans have to poland .
for the french , siberia begins at the rhine and for us , it begins at the oder river .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so near and yet so far !
have relations between germans and poles changed since you have been living in poland ?
yes .
more and more germans and poles are getting married .
it 's not about some german farmers picking polish women from a catalogue .
in 2005 alone , there were 6,000 german-polish marriages .
and more than 400 german and polish towns are twinned with one another .
there are a lot of school partnerships , too .
but i 'm not really sure that this is a growing trend .
i think that in 2002/2003 there was a lot of interest on the german side after poland 's accession to the eu .
i think that this might have waned a little .
your book " viva polonia " appeared in german this year .
late last year , german publishing house suhrkamp also published an encyclopedic guide to polish culture .
there does appear to be a market for books about germany 's eastern neighbor .
the germans do n't know a lot about poland , and what i think is very sad is that you ca n't really study polish in germany .
in all of germany there is only one chair in polish studies .
there are people working in west slavic studies , but no experts purely for poland .
berlin is only 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from the polish border , but it feels like a thousand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in " viva polonia " moeller describes his experiences as a german guestworker do the poles know a lot about germany ?
the poles are much more interested in other countries than other post-socialist states .
just think of the amount of emigration to england .
many germans do n't even realize that almost 2 million poles are currently living in england . you have become best known in poland through your role as stefan mueller , a german farmer living in poland , in one of the country 's most popular soaps , " m jak milosc " -lrb- l for love -rrb- .
why did this german figure become so popular in poland ?
and the real steffen moeller ?
i have n't actually appeared in the soap for the last six months .
i am " resting . "
the nice thing in poland is that soap opera characters do n't have to die in plane crashes , they just get sent abroad .
it 's quite a legitimate means , since poles are continually going abroad .
i think that the character is popular because he 's so hapless .
he 's unlucky in love , but he 's really a nice lad whom everyone wants to help .
i also appear in an entertainment show about europe .
there i play the comedian and i display a characteristic that poles do n't expect from germans : self-irony .
it 's easy to be a german abroad .
you just have to play up the cliches a little and then subvert them , and presto , you 're a cabaret star .
there 's no other country in europe that has such a bad image as germany , and that 's a good starting point for cabaret .
so you actually profit from these stereotypes about the germans ?
of course !

but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .
at family celebrations , she hears time and time again how lucky she is to be a student .
but mareike says she feels anything but happy .
psychosomatic illness on the rise her problems began when she finished secondary school and made the transition to university .
she suffered from psychosomatic stomach and intestinal complaints .
but , she put it all down to her diet and decided to change her eating habits .
when this did n't help matters , her psychological problems got worse .
shortly before finishing her bachelor 's degree , her physical symptoms become too much to bear .
in addition to her stomach and intestinal problems , she also started experiencing difficulties in breathing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are under pressure to spend fewer years at university like many others , mareike failed to attribute her health problems to the strain she was feeling from her studies .
" somehow , you just ca n't accept that there 's something wrong with your body , " she said .
" you think there has to be some sort of disease behind it , because this feeling is just so real . "
mareike sought out different doctors , and underwent a battery of tests .
only when specialists had ruled out all physical causes did she allow herself to think that the cause could be psychological .
it 's not just the sufferer who has trouble identifying the cause of their problems .
often , doctors do n't realize how much stress the student is under , so they look for other causes in what can be a long , painful process .
students increasingly look to alcohol , drugs it 's no wonder , then , that more and more students reach for a " quick fix " in the form of alcohol .
a study by the university of muenster found that every third university student has a problem with alcohol .
cannabis consumption is also on the rise , and while the normal german worker takes anti-depressant medication on an average of 3.5 days a year , the average dose for students is five days .
attempts to relax and escape the pressure of competition are becoming ever more dangerous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say more students are looking to alcohol as a way to relax experts are increasingly warning about the link between studying and stress .
the public health insurance fund techniker , together with the university of bielefeld , carried out a survey of 3,300 students that came to shocking conclusions .
sixteen percent of those polled reported feeling depressed , and every fourth student said they suffered from excessive neck and back pain and / or had difficulty concentrating .
according to techniker spokeswoman andrea kleinbreuer , there are multiple causes , from uncomfortable chairs in overfilled lecture halls , to time pressure and financial worries due to increasing tuition fees .
" students have to deal with these burdens , the pressure at universities is growing , " kleinbreuer said .
prevention is key in order to prevent students from suffering from nervous breakdowns , public health funds are developing special preventative programs for universities .
among the offerings are courses on stress-free studying .
participants learn everything from how to sit ergonomically and better manage their time , to how to relax - without turning to alcohol , drugs or medication . armin himmelrath -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" founded in 1970 , the raf was responsible for 34 deaths and continues to divide public opinion in germany .
on sept .
5 , 1977 , the left-wing terrorist group kidnapped hanns martin schleyer , the president of the federation of german industries , and killed four of his escorts . the attack started events known as the german autumn which culminated in a plane hijack , the prison suicides of three raf leaders and schleyer 's murder . the raf had plans to abduct west german chancellor willy brandt and fashion designer karl lagerfeld in the 1970s .
last year , german authorities reopened the investigation into the 1977 murder of federal prosecutor siegfried buback after a former raf terrorist claimed he had new information about the killing . germans remain divided on the release last year of members of the raf from prison after courts deemed them to no longer be a threat to society . dw-world.de reviews some of the historic events and current debates surrounding the red army faction .

when an event is shared , the problems can sometimes double - just ask euro 2008 hosts austria and switzerland . even in the case of the european soccer championships , an event which takes place every four years , no single blueprint for success can be applied to every nation .
every host country faces its own set of problems arising from its geographical , cultural and social situation . when an event takes place spread over two countries , those difficulties take on a more complex nature . one of the major problems concerning the collaboration and cooperation between the two euro 2008 host nations is that austria is a member of the european union and switzerland is not . the last european championship to be shared between countries , the 2000 tournament in belgium and the netherlands , also had problems arising from such an arrangement : the single currency was still two years away , meaning fans had to change money between countries .
though full implementation of the schengen free movement agreement allowed hassle-free travel between the host nations . fans wanting to follow their teams in austria and switzerland would normally face these same difficulties and more .
as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any of the bloc 's cooperation agreements in border security and policing and still uses the swiss franc as its currency . because switzerland is not a member of the schengen agreement , those traveling to the finals this summer with the intention of visiting both host countries would have needed to get two visas .
despite an agreement which allows the free movement of goods into switzerland from the eu , the stricter provisions in the schengen treaty do not contain any exemption with respect to switzerland . visa deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu approved the plans for a special switzerland visa however , while sharing the host duties can sometimes increase the potential for disaster , the old adage of two heads being better than one also applies .
add some more heads willing to come up with answers and even the most complicated of matters can be solved through cooperation . a new simplified visa process was agreed at a meeting last year involving christoph blocher , switzerland 's then head of the federal council , austrian interior minister guenther platter , his german counterpart wolfgang schaeuble , and the foreign minister of liechtenstein , rita kieber-beck . the meeting led to an agreement which will make it possible to travel in both austria and switzerland with a single visa for the duration of the tournament . " the temporary visa operation will allow fans from participating countries that are part of the schengen agreement to travel freely in switzerland , " konrad kogler from the austrian interior ministry told dw-world.de. " the joint delegations have held extensive negotiations with the european union on this topic and were given approval .
a contract had to be signed between the schengen nations and switzerland to allow this temporary visa arrangement . " visitors will only have to apply for a visa in austria , while switzerland will explore whether there are any fernhaltegruende or reasons to deny them entry .
providing that is not the case , the holder of a schengen visa will receive a special additional euro 2008 stamp that will allow them to cross the austrian-swiss border without any difficulties . joint border patrols the border the fans will cross also cause headaches .
while the visa will allow fans to enter switzerland easier , the border will remain one between a non-eu country and an eu member state , meaning that it will still have controls .
who operates those controls was also a matter of discussion , negotiation and agreement . " with problems like these , arising from the fact that one country is part of the eu and the other is not , collaboration and cooperation is key , " said kogler .
" that is why , in regard to the border , there is also a temporary agreement in place for the championships where border controls will be manned by mixed teams from both countries . " bildunterschrift : an eu police collaboration will ease swiss burdens questions have also arisen over the wider implications for shared security .
european union countries are subject to agreements signed in brussels which allow cross-border cooperation in policing .
again , as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any security agreement , although the austrians and swiss have made an arrangement for euro 2008 . " in terms of policing , there are cooperation and collaboration centers in every host city in each country , " kogler said .
" there are liaison officers from austria in the swiss centers and vice versa .
there will not be any large deployments of police in each other 's country .
while this is not really an eu issue , it is a european policing issue , so there will also be officers from countries contributing to the frontex external border security agency operating in both austria and switzerland during the tournament . " european cops assist in swiss security last year , the swiss federal council approved a request for support from beyond the co-host 's borders made by a combined committee of regional police forces , after it became clear that the swiss police force would be over-stretched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be deployed in both nations although no " high-risk " games will take place in switzerland , the help is needed as eight countries , including the co-hosts , will be based in the nation , and a high number of visitors are expected . as a result of this agreement german officers will be deployed in host cities basel and zurich during the championships , and french police will be stationed in geneva .
the german police will also have a presence in austria . a question of currency however , once safely through the border controls into the well-policed cities of switzerland , most fans will still be faced with another problem : dealing with a different currency .
those from euro-zone countries will still be confronted with the constant need to change money . while not all the participating countries use the euro , fans from those which do n't will have extra problems : changing their own currency not only into the euro for use in austria but also into the franc for switzerland . no solution has yet been found to ease the potential problem of thousands of fans dealing with two currencies during the championships . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when an event is shared , the problems can sometimes double - just ask euro 2008 hosts austria and switzerland . even in the case of the european soccer championships , an event which takes place every four years , no single blueprint for success can be applied to every nation .
every host country faces its own set of problems arising from its geographical , cultural and social situation . when an event takes place spread over two countries , those difficulties take on a more complex nature . one of the major problems concerning the collaboration and cooperation between the two euro 2008 host nations is that austria is a member of the european union and switzerland is not . the last european championship to be shared between countries , the 2000 tournament in belgium and the netherlands , also had problems arising from such an arrangement : the single currency was still two years away , meaning fans had to change money between countries .
though full implementation of the schengen free movement agreement allowed hassle-free travel between the host nations . fans wanting to follow their teams in austria and switzerland would normally face these same difficulties and more .
as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any of the bloc 's cooperation agreements in border security and policing and still uses the swiss franc as its currency . because switzerland is not a member of the schengen agreement , those traveling to the finals this summer with the intention of visiting both host countries would have needed to get two visas .
despite an agreement which allows the free movement of goods into switzerland from the eu , the stricter provisions in the schengen treaty do not contain any exemption with respect to switzerland . visa deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu approved the plans for a special switzerland visa however , while sharing the host duties can sometimes increase the potential for disaster , the old adage of two heads being better than one also applies .
add some more heads willing to come up with answers and even the most complicated of matters can be solved through cooperation . a new simplified visa process was agreed at a meeting last year involving christoph blocher , switzerland 's then head of the federal council , austrian interior minister guenther platter , his german counterpart wolfgang schaeuble , and the foreign minister of liechtenstein , rita kieber-beck . the meeting led to an agreement which will make it possible to travel in both austria and switzerland with a single visa for the duration of the tournament . " the temporary visa operation will allow fans from participating countries that are part of the schengen agreement to travel freely in switzerland , " konrad kogler from the austrian interior ministry told dw-world.de. " the joint delegations have held extensive negotiations with the european union on this topic and were given approval .
a contract had to be signed between the schengen nations and switzerland to allow this temporary visa arrangement . " visitors will only have to apply for a visa in austria , while switzerland will explore whether there are any fernhaltegruende or reasons to deny them entry .
providing that is not the case , the holder of a schengen visa will receive a special additional euro 2008 stamp that will allow them to cross the austrian-swiss border without any difficulties . joint border patrols the border the fans will cross also cause headaches .
while the visa will allow fans to enter switzerland easier , the border will remain one between a non-eu country and an eu member state , meaning that it will still have controls .
who operates those controls was also a matter of discussion , negotiation and agreement . " with problems like these , arising from the fact that one country is part of the eu and the other is not , collaboration and cooperation is key , " said kogler .
" that is why , in regard to the border , there is also a temporary agreement in place for the championships where border controls will be manned by mixed teams from both countries . " bildunterschrift : an eu police collaboration will ease swiss burdens questions have also arisen over the wider implications for shared security .
european union countries are subject to agreements signed in brussels which allow cross-border cooperation in policing .
again , as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any security agreement , although the austrians and swiss have made an arrangement for euro 2008 . " in terms of policing , there are cooperation and collaboration centers in every host city in each country , " kogler said .
" there are liaison officers from austria in the swiss centers and vice versa .
there will not be any large deployments of police in each other 's country .
while this is not really an eu issue , it is a european policing issue , so there will also be officers from countries contributing to the frontex external border security agency operating in both austria and switzerland during the tournament .

when an event is shared , the problems can sometimes double - just ask euro 2008 hosts austria and switzerland . even in the case of the european soccer championships , an event which takes place every four years , no single blueprint for success can be applied to every nation .
every host country faces its own set of problems arising from its geographical , cultural and social situation . when an event takes place spread over two countries , those difficulties take on a more complex nature . one of the major problems concerning the collaboration and cooperation between the two euro 2008 host nations is that austria is a member of the european union and switzerland is not . the last european championship to be shared between countries , the 2000 tournament in belgium and the netherlands , also had problems arising from such an arrangement : the single currency was still two years away , meaning fans had to change money between countries .
though full implementation of the schengen free movement agreement allowed hassle-free travel between the host nations . fans wanting to follow their teams in austria and switzerland would normally face these same difficulties and more .
as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any of the bloc 's cooperation agreements in border security and policing and still uses the swiss franc as its currency . because switzerland is not a member of the schengen agreement , those traveling to the finals this summer with the intention of visiting both host countries would have needed to get two visas .
despite an agreement which allows the free movement of goods into switzerland from the eu , the stricter provisions in the schengen treaty do not contain any exemption with respect to switzerland . visa deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu approved the plans for a special switzerland visa however , while sharing the host duties can sometimes increase the potential for disaster , the old adage of two heads being better than one also applies .
add some more heads willing to come up with answers and even the most complicated of matters can be solved through cooperation . a new simplified visa process was agreed at a meeting last year involving christoph blocher , switzerland 's then head of the federal council , austrian interior minister guenther platter , his german counterpart wolfgang schaeuble , and the foreign minister of liechtenstein , rita kieber-beck . the meeting led to an agreement which will make it possible to travel in both austria and switzerland with a single visa for the duration of the tournament . " the temporary visa operation will allow fans from participating countries that are part of the schengen agreement to travel freely in switzerland , " konrad kogler from the austrian interior ministry told dw-world.de. " the joint delegations have held extensive negotiations with the european union on this topic and were given approval .
a contract had to be signed between the schengen nations and switzerland to allow this temporary visa arrangement . " visitors will only have to apply for a visa in austria , while switzerland will explore whether there are any fernhaltegruende or reasons to deny them entry .
providing that is not the case , the holder of a schengen visa will receive a special additional euro 2008 stamp that will allow them to cross the austrian-swiss border without any difficulties . joint border patrols the border the fans will cross also cause headaches .
while the visa will allow fans to enter switzerland easier , the border will remain one between a non-eu country and an eu member state , meaning that it will still have controls .
who operates those controls was also a matter of discussion , negotiation and agreement . " with problems like these , arising from the fact that one country is part of the eu and the other is not , collaboration and cooperation is key , " said kogler .
" that is why , in regard to the border , there is also a temporary agreement in place for the championships where border controls will be manned by mixed teams from both countries . " bildunterschrift : an eu police collaboration will ease swiss burdens questions have also arisen over the wider implications for shared security .
european union countries are subject to agreements signed in brussels which allow cross-border cooperation in policing .
again , as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any security agreement , although the austrians and swiss have made an arrangement for euro 2008 . " in terms of policing , there are cooperation and collaboration centers in every host city in each country , " kogler said .
" there are liaison officers from austria in the swiss centers and vice versa .
there will not be any large deployments of police in each other 's country .
while this is not really an eu issue , it is a european policing issue , so there will also be officers from countries contributing to the frontex external border security agency operating in both austria and switzerland during the tournament . " european cops assist in swiss security last year , the swiss federal council approved a request for support from beyond the co-host 's borders made by a combined committee of regional police forces , after it became clear that the swiss police force would be over-stretched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be deployed in both nations although no " high-risk " games will take place in switzerland , the help is needed as eight countries , including the co-hosts , will be based in the nation , and a high number of visitors are expected . as a result of this agreement german officers will be deployed in host cities basel and zurich during the championships , and french police will be stationed in geneva .
the german police will also have a presence in austria . a question of currency however , once safely through the border controls into the well-policed cities of switzerland , most fans will still be faced with another problem : dealing with a different currency .
those from euro-zone countries will still be confronted with the constant need to change money . while not all the participating countries use the euro , fans from those which do n't will have extra problems : changing their own currency not only into the euro for use in austria but also into the franc for switzerland . no solution has yet been found to ease the potential problem of thousands of fans dealing with two currencies during the championships . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

again , as a non-eu country , switzerland is not a signatory of any security agreement , although the austrians and swiss have made an arrangement for euro 2008 . " in terms of policing , there are cooperation and collaboration centers in every host city in each country , " kogler said .
" there are liaison officers from austria in the swiss centers and vice versa .
there will not be any large deployments of police in each other 's country .
while this is not really an eu issue , it is a european policing issue , so there will also be officers from countries contributing to the frontex external border security agency operating in both austria and switzerland during the tournament . " european cops assist in swiss security last year , the swiss federal council approved a request for support from beyond the co-host 's borders made by a combined committee of regional police forces , after it became clear that the swiss police force would be over-stretched . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be deployed in both nations although no " high-risk " games will take place in switzerland , the help is needed as eight countries , including the co-hosts , will be based in the nation , and a high number of visitors are expected . as a result of this agreement german officers will be deployed in host cities basel and zurich during the championships , and french police will be stationed in geneva .
the german police will also have a presence in austria . a question of currency however , once safely through the border controls into the well-policed cities of switzerland , most fans will still be faced with another problem : dealing with a different currency .
those from euro-zone countries will still be confronted with the constant need to change money . while not all the participating countries use the euro , fans from those which do n't will have extra problems : changing their own currency not only into the euro for use in austria but also into the franc for switzerland . no solution has yet been found to ease the potential problem of thousands of fans dealing with two currencies during the championships . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they 're also upping the pressure .
a new study claims that increased drug use is the result . it used to be that german students spent an average of six years at university before getting a degree , but times are changing .
in conjunction with the more streamlined bachelor 's and master 's degrees gaining popularity here , students face a more regular barrage of tests and exams - meaning increased pressure to perform .
to combat this , it seems more and more german students are turning to alcohol and drugs .
like mareike , 24 , a master 's student at a university in northern germany .
at family celebrations , she hears time and time again how lucky she is to be a student .
but mareike says she feels anything but happy .
psychosomatic illness on the rise her problems began when she finished secondary school and made the transition to university .
she suffered from psychosomatic stomach and intestinal complaints .
but , she put it all down to her diet and decided to change her eating habits .
when this did n't help matters , her psychological problems got worse .
shortly before finishing her bachelor 's degree , her physical symptoms become too much to bear .
in addition to her stomach and intestinal problems , she also started experiencing difficulties in breathing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are under pressure to spend fewer years at university like many others , mareike failed to attribute her health problems to the strain she was feeling from her studies .
" somehow , you just ca n't accept that there 's something wrong with your body , " she said .
" you think there has to be some sort of disease behind it , because this feeling is just so real . "
mareike sought out different doctors , and underwent a battery of tests .
only when specialists had ruled out all physical causes did she allow herself to think that the cause could be psychological .
it 's not just the sufferer who has trouble identifying the cause of their problems .
often , doctors do n't realize how much stress the student is under , so they look for other causes in what can be a long , painful process .
students increasingly look to alcohol , drugs it 's no wonder , then , that more and more students reach for a " quick fix " in the form of alcohol .
a study by the university of muenster found that every third university student has a problem with alcohol .
cannabis consumption is also on the rise , and while the normal german worker takes anti-depressant medication on an average of 3.5 days a year , the average dose for students is five days .
attempts to relax and escape the pressure of competition are becoming ever more dangerous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say more students are looking to alcohol as a way to relax experts are increasingly warning about the link between studying and stress .
the public health insurance fund techniker , together with the university of bielefeld , carried out a survey of 3,300 students that came to shocking conclusions .
sixteen percent of those polled reported feeling depressed , and every fourth student said they suffered from excessive neck and back pain and / or had difficulty concentrating .
according to techniker spokeswoman andrea kleinbreuer , there are multiple causes , from uncomfortable chairs in overfilled lecture halls , to time pressure and financial worries due to increasing tuition fees .
" students have to deal with these burdens , the pressure at universities is growing , " kleinbreuer said .
prevention is key in order to prevent students from suffering from nervous breakdowns , public health funds are developing special preventative programs for universities .
among the offerings are courses on stress-free studying .
participants learn everything from how to sit ergonomically and better manage their time , to how to relax - without turning to alcohol , drugs or medication . armin himmelrath -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by joe lynam business reporter , bbc news indian restaurants in the uk have traditionally been family-run when it comes to restaurant chains , diners usually know what to expect from the hamburgers or coffee in places like mcdonalds or costa .
but with indian food , would one want the masala or korma to taste the same everywhere ?
one group is hoping so , as it aims to be the first chain of indian restaurants with franchises all over britain .
the british high street is teeming with franchises .
italian , mexican , american or chinese – whatever the flavour , there is a chain of restaurants to meet the demand .
but no-one has opened up a nationwide chain of indian franchises yet .
the question is : will the british palate have a taste for it ?
recipe for disaster tiffinbites hopes to create 50 potential franchises throughout britain by the end of 2009 .
for a fee of £ 150,000 -lrb- us $ 300,000 -rrb- plus a share of profits , franchisees get prepared food from a central kitchen which they reheat or ' regenerate ' -lrb- in pr speak -rrb- locally .
they also get full marketing and training support as part of the package .
one of the tiffinbites directors , arjun varma , wants the south asian food sector to modernise .

by joe lynam business reporter , bbc news indian restaurants in the uk have traditionally been family-run when it comes to restaurant chains , diners usually know what to expect from the hamburgers or coffee in places like mcdonalds or costa .

the british high street is teeming with franchises .
italian , mexican , american or chinese – whatever the flavour , there is a chain of restaurants to meet the demand .

but with indian food , would one want the masala or korma to taste the same everywhere ?
one group is hoping so , as it aims to be the first chain of indian restaurants with franchises all over britain .
the british high street is teeming with franchises .
italian , mexican , american or chinese – whatever the flavour , there is a chain of restaurants to meet the demand .
but no-one has opened up a nationwide chain of indian franchises yet .
the question is : will the british palate have a taste for it ?
recipe for disaster tiffinbites hopes to create 50 potential franchises throughout britain by the end of 2009 .
for a fee of £ 150,000 -lrb- us $ 300,000 -rrb- plus a share of profits , franchisees get prepared food from a central kitchen which they reheat or ' regenerate ' -lrb- in pr speak -rrb- locally .
they also get full marketing and training support as part of the package .
one of the tiffinbites directors , arjun varma , wants the south asian food sector to modernise . "
by the very nature that it 's scaled up to lots of different outlets , you lose a lot of originality " john holton fig tree network " we are aiming for the young entrepreneurs who want to get into the indian food industry , " says arjun .
" rather than taking on a family-run scenario , they can have a professionally-backed franchise , which they would then build into two or three restaurants depending on their appetite . "
but marketing and branding experts are not so sure that avoiding the traditional route for indian cuisine might prove to be a recipe for disaster .
" one of the downsides is that most indian restaurants are family-run businesses , offering very authentic home recipes from the menus .
one of the things you lose in a franchise is that sense , " according to john holton from fig tree network .
" it becomes slightly impersonal and by the very nature that it 's scaled up to lots of different outlets , you lose a lot of originality . "
the concept of franchising indian food is not the first big national venture for the company which owns tiffinbites – the gourmet restaurant group .
it already supplies 350 companies – including barclays , virgin and hsbc .
set up five years ago by a former lingerie buyer at marks and spencer , jamal hirani , the group now has a number of spicy fingers in a variety of indian samosas .
its central kitchen in north london prepares south asian food on a wholesale basis for a number of restaurants - including one at selfridges - as well as airlines including klm and malaysian .
new rules the indian food sector has come a long way from the 1960s and 70s , when the first wave of south asian immigrants arrived in britain offering what was then a new type of dining at affordable prices .
but the home office 's recent clampdown on all non-eu immigration is taking its toll on the ethnic food sector .
the new points-based system which came into force at the end of february is making it much tougher for indian restaurants to get the qualified chefs they need .
under the new rules , chefs need to speak english and have some third level education if they are to work and live in the uk .
the ethnic catering alliance , which is organising a protest march in london , is calling for exemptions to be made for specialist workers such as indian chefs ironically , the new get-tough immigration policy might prove a boon for the tiffinbites franchising business .

australia 's foreign minister stephen smith said a split from the british monarchy was " inevitable " .
prime minister kevin rudd invited 1,000 people , including actors cate blanchett and hugh jackman , to the two-day summit to brainstorm ideas .
aboriginal issues and climate change are also on the australia 2020 agenda .
the meeting , which started on saturday in the capital canberra , has brought together australia 's best and brightest brains with the aim of plotting the country 's future trajectory .
delegate cheers a move towards a republic is one of the main ideas being put forward , with the panel on governance originally agreeing on a 12-year target to have an australian head of state .
but the government 's home affairs minister , bob debus , challenged the group to agree to a shorter time frame - a republic by 2010 which drew cheers from many delegates .
mr rudd , whose election in november ended almost 12 years of conservative rule , is a longstanding republican but he has said he does not regard it as a high priority .
on sunday , mr smith said while the centre-left labour government favoured a split from the country 's former colonial power , it was not an urgent matter .
" i regard it as inevitable .
i do n't see it occurring in 2010 , " he told australia 's network ten .
" it 's one of those things i think the nation will attend to in due course . "
in the weeks leading up to the summit , radio talk shows invited listeners to call with ideas and about 9,000 messages were sent to the australia 2020 website .
final proposals will be delivered to the government but there is no certainty any will be implemented .
setting 10 themes for discussion , mr rudd said : " the old way of governing has long been creaking and groaning .
" some of these ideas we will be able to embrace , others we will not , and some we will take in part and change . "

australia 's foreign minister stephen smith said a split from the british monarchy was " inevitable " .
prime minister kevin rudd invited 1,000 people , including actors cate blanchett and hugh jackman , to the two-day summit to brainstorm ideas .
aboriginal issues and climate change are also on the australia 2020 agenda .
the meeting , which started on saturday in the capital canberra , has brought together australia 's best and brightest brains with the aim of plotting the country 's future trajectory .
delegate cheers a move towards a republic is one of the main ideas being put forward , with the panel on governance originally agreeing on a 12-year target to have an australian head of state .
but the government 's home affairs minister , bob debus , challenged the group to agree to a shorter time frame - a republic by 2010 which drew cheers from many delegates .
mr rudd , whose election in november ended almost 12 years of conservative rule , is a longstanding republican but he has said he does not regard it as a high priority .
on sunday , mr smith said while the centre-left labour government favoured a split from the country 's former colonial power , it was not an urgent matter .
" i regard it as inevitable .
i do n't see it occurring in 2010 , " he told australia 's network ten .
" it 's one of those things i think the nation will attend to in due course . "
in the weeks leading up to the summit , radio talk shows invited listeners to call with ideas and about 9,000 messages were sent to the australia 2020 website .
final proposals will be delivered to the government but there is no certainty any will be implemented .
setting 10 themes for discussion , mr rudd said : " the old way of governing has long been creaking and groaning .
" some of these ideas we will be able to embrace , others we will not , and some we will take in part and change . "

australia 's foreign minister stephen smith said a split from the british monarchy was " inevitable " .
prime minister kevin rudd invited 1,000 people , including actors cate blanchett and hugh jackman , to the two-day summit to brainstorm ideas .
aboriginal issues and climate change are also on the australia 2020 agenda .
the meeting , which started on saturday in the capital canberra , has brought together australia 's best and brightest brains with the aim of plotting the country 's future trajectory .
delegate cheers a move towards a republic is one of the main ideas being put forward , with the panel on governance originally agreeing on a 12-year target to have an australian head of state .
but the government 's home affairs minister , bob debus , challenged the group to agree to a shorter time frame - a republic by 2010 which drew cheers from many delegates .
mr rudd , whose election in november ended almost 12 years of conservative rule , is a longstanding republican but he has said he does not regard it as a high priority .
on sunday , mr smith said while the centre-left labour government favoured a split from the country 's former colonial power , it was not an urgent matter .
" i regard it as inevitable .
i do n't see it occurring in 2010 , " he told australia 's network ten .
" it 's one of those things i think the nation will attend to in due course . "
in the weeks leading up to the summit , radio talk shows invited listeners to call with ideas and about 9,000 messages were sent to the australia 2020 website .
final proposals will be delivered to the government but there is no certainty any will be implemented .
setting 10 themes for discussion , mr rudd said : " the old way of governing has long been creaking and groaning .
" some of these ideas we will be able to embrace , others we will not , and some we will take in part and change . "

speakers outside the presidential palace demanded the group be banned .
that was what a government panel recommended last week , saying the ahmadiyya 's beliefs went against islam as practised in indonesia .
but the ahmadiyya argue that , like other minorities , they are protected under the indonesian constitution .
the ahmadis believe their own founder , mirza ghulam ahmad , who died in 1908 in india , was a prophet .
that contradicts the belief of most muslims , who think the prophet muhammad was the last prophet .
the ahmadiyya face persecution in many countries .
passions high sunday 's demonstration brought together hard-line islamic groups and more established muslim organisations - all believe that ahmadis are non-muslims .
as well as a ban , the speakers called on the protesters to drive the ahmadiyya out of indonesia .
the protesters clearly felt very strongly about this issue , reports the bbc 's lucy williamson at the protest .
they see the ahmadiyya 's beliefs as a threat to mainstream islam - and many see a vote for pluralism as a vote for western-style secularism , she says .
but president susilo bambang yudhoyono is in a difficult position .
the constitution says indonesians have a right to religious freedom .
the question is , our correspondent says , where the government will draw the line .

that was what a government panel recommended last week , saying the ahmadiyya 's beliefs went against islam as practised in indonesia .

the ahmadis believe their own founder , mirza ghulam ahmad , who died in 1908 in india , was a prophet .

the protesters clearly felt very strongly about this issue , reports the bbc 's lucy williamson at the protest .
they see the ahmadiyya 's beliefs as a threat to mainstream islam - and many see a vote for pluralism as a vote for western-style secularism , she says .

by the light of april 's full moon on sunday or , quite likely a night or two after , corals will be mating en masse .
along the length of the island archipelago that makes up the republic of palau , millions of coral colonies will simultaneously release billion upon billion of eggs and sperm into the dark waters .
an hour or so after sunset , each spawning coral will discharge showers of sex cells , packaged in orange and pink blobs .
they will rise to the surface in such huge numbers that they may form oily slicks metres long .
if the sea conditions are right , spawn slicks can coalesce to be large enough to be visible from space .
depressing need once on the surface , the packages burst open , liberating eggs and sperm for fertilisation .
countless free-swimming coral larvae then develop and three or four days later , a few will have survived long enough to make it to the sea bed .
there they attach to a suitable hard surface and develop into single baby coral polyps .
the next generation of corals on the reefs will be launched .
a team of marine biologists from australia , britain and the philippines has come to palau to take advantage of this wonder of nature in the cause of coral reef restoration .
the scientists are here to investigate the potential of an experimental technique known as coral seeding - in other words , collecting some of the spawn from mass mating events and using it to promote the growth of new corals on reefs in need of rescue .
the reefs around palau are in good shape but elsewhere throughout the tropical world , many coral ecosystems are in a parlous state .
plenty spare pollution , over-fishing and coral bleaching events , which are caused by marine heat waves , have reduced the amount of coral to the point where these naturally bio-diverse habitats are at varying degrees of degradation .
many are nearing ecological collapse - some have gone forever , already .
however , many reefs might be salvageable if they are first protected from pollution and overexploitation , and then are seeded with some surplus spawn from more vibrant reefs .
most of the eggs and larvae from a mass spawning event are eaten or die before they get an anchor hold on the sea bed , so there is plenty of spawn to share around .
in the coming experiment on palau , the scientists will not be using coral spawn produced on the open reefs .
partly for practical reasons , they will harvest their spawn under more controllable conditions at the laboratory of the palau international coral reef center .
in the lab on saturday , i joined them on a trip to collect 10 dinner-plate-sized coral colonies from luke 's reef about 20 minutes speed-boat-ride from the reef center .
james guest , from the university of newcastle , uk , and maria vanessa baria from the university of the philippines dived to the sea bed , armed with hammers and chisels .
they were after a particular species of branching coral which forms large tables or shelves as it grows .
it is this type which is one of the most abundant and most important reef builders .
it takes a few taps at the stony stalk base of each colony to break them free .
waiting on the boat to receive the corals was andrew heyward of the australian institute for marine science - one of the first biologists to describe the phenomenon of coral mass spawning in the 1980s .
the colonies were put straight into tubs of sea water , and once the tenth was on board , we headed back at a high rate of knots to the reef center .
back at the center , the coral were transferred with speed to larger tanks , filled with constantly refreshed seawater .
setting up home now there 's a lull before the spawn .
the main event could happen sunday or monday or tuesday night -lrb- palau time -rrb- .
and some species will synchronously spawn the day after others .
when the captive corals in the lab release their eggs and sperm , the contained spawn will be transferred to children 's paddling pools floating in the sea next to the lab .
over the following few days , the researchers will check the developing larvae to see how many are mature enough to settle down and become fixed baby coral polyps .
when sufficient numbers are good to go , the team will take the batch of larvae back to the reef and pump them over areas of potential colonisation .
the new homes for the larvae are artificial reef balls placed there specially for the purpose .
they are domes of limestone concrete about a one metre wide and high .
before the larva can be introduced , the reef balls will have to be covered so the larvae do n't just float away .
big question so the team will dive the five metres to the sea bed and erect two-man camping tents made of fine mesh over each artificial reef structure .
the baby corals will travel from the boat through the zipped door of the tent via a hose pipe .
andrew heyward says the aim of this experiment is to be " low tech or no tech " .
he feels this approach is vital if the technique of coral seeding is ever to be used on any scale in developing countries .
twenty-four-hours later , the team will check to see how many of their " seeds " have settled by removing small tiles they 've placed on the reef balls .
they will do that again in a few months and after a year .
each time they will compare the number of young corals with those on tiles from control balls which would have been settled by larvae born in the mass spawning on the reef .
andrew heyward points out that loading the dice in the larvae 's favour before they settle is only part of the issue over whether coral seeding will work to restore reefs .
" if you boost the number of larval corals settling on a coral reef , so what ?
does it make any difference to the longer term compared to an area where you did nothing ? "
the answer will emerge in the next 12 months following this week 's frenzy of mass reproduction on the reefs of palau .

by the light of april 's full moon on sunday or , quite likely a night or two after , corals will be mating en masse .
along the length of the island archipelago that makes up the republic of palau , millions of coral colonies will simultaneously release billion upon billion of eggs and sperm into the dark waters .
an hour or so after sunset , each spawning coral will discharge showers of sex cells , packaged in orange and pink blobs .
they will rise to the surface in such huge numbers that they may form oily slicks metres long .
if the sea conditions are right , spawn slicks can coalesce to be large enough to be visible from space .

countless free-swimming coral larvae then develop and three or four days later , a few will have survived long enough to make it to the sea bed .
there they attach to a suitable hard surface and develop into single baby coral polyps .
the next generation of corals on the reefs will be launched .
a team of marine biologists from australia , britain and the philippines has come to palau to take advantage of this wonder of nature in the cause of coral reef restoration .
the scientists are here to investigate the potential of an experimental technique known as coral seeding - in other words , collecting some of the spawn from mass mating events and using it to promote the growth of new corals on reefs in need of rescue .
the reefs around palau are in good shape but elsewhere throughout the tropical world , many coral ecosystems are in a parlous state .
plenty spare pollution , over-fishing and coral bleaching events , which are caused by marine heat waves , have reduced the amount of coral to the point where these naturally bio-diverse habitats are at varying degrees of degradation .
many are nearing ecological collapse - some have gone forever , already .
acropora is an important reef-builder and is common here however , many reefs might be salvageable if they are first protected from pollution and overexploitation , and then are seeded with some surplus spawn from more vibrant reefs .
most of the eggs and larvae from a mass spawning event are eaten or die before they get an anchor hold on the sea bed , so there is plenty of spawn to share around .
in the coming experiment on palau , the scientists will not be using coral spawn produced on the open reefs .
partly for practical reasons , they will harvest their spawn under more controllable conditions at the laboratory of the palau international coral reef center .
in the lab on saturday , i joined them on a trip to collect 10 dinner-plate-sized coral colonies from luke 's reef about 20 minutes speed-boat-ride from the reef center .

alistair darling added that without the bank of england 's intervention there was " every chance " the situation would get worse .
mr darling confirmed a scheme to lend banks money to help them operate during the credit squeeze .
but he insisted that the loans would have to be paid back .
the bbc understands that the bank will announce the plans to swap about £ 50bn worth of government bonds for british banks ' mortgages .
business editor robert peston said it would be the biggest ever special initiative by the british monetary authorities to supply liquidity to the british banking system .
' essential step ' the move would help ease the funding problems which many banks face , opening up the mortgage market to benefit householders and would-be buyers , mr darling said .
the sooner there is more openness and transparency the more chance there is of getting ourselves back to the stability and normality that we need chancellor alistair darling bank £ 50bn mortgage rescue plan " what it will do is effectively lend banks money to unfreeze the situation we have got at the moment .
" we believe this will be an essential step in trying to get the financial markets stabilised and that in turn will help the mortgage markets too .
" if this does not happen then there 's every chance the situation will get worse . "
and likening the situation to a dose of food poisoning , he said that some aspects of the credit crisis " just need to work their way through the system " .
mr darling denied that the scheme was a bail-out for the banks .
" the bank of england will be lending the money , so it 's got to be repaid , and we will take securities in return for it , " he said .
but liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable expressed concern that the government was offering the banks too good a deal .
" we can not have a situation where the banks are able to privatise their profits and nationalise their losses , " he said .
" since the mortgages from the banks are of inferior quality and higher risk than the government bonds which they are replacing , the implication must be that taxpayers are shouldering the risks and losses of the banks .
" we need urgent reassurances from the government that the exchange is taking place on a discounted basis so that the banks and not taxpayers carry any losses . "
' reveal exposure ' banks are increasingly unwilling to lend to one another because of uncertainty over the exposure which they have to the us sub-prime mortgage market .
the banks have been asking for longer term finance from the bank of england to fill their funding gap following the collapse of the market for mortgage-backed securities last august .
the disappearance of this market deprived banks of tens of billions of pounds of finance for mortgage lending and is one of the main reasons why the cost of mortgages for many homeowners has been rising , even though the bank of england has been cutting its base lending rate .
mr darling said it was important that the banks began to reveal the extent of their losses as a result of exposure to the sub-prime market - as well as how they were going to rebuild capital .
britain 's second largest bank , royal bank of scotland , is to ask shareholders for about £ 10bn of extra cash to improve its financial position .
other institutions were likely to follow suit , the chancellor said .
" the sooner there is more openness and transparency and banks understand the extent of what happened to them since last summer , the more chance there is of getting ourselves back to the stability and normality that we need , " he said .
the chancellor will announce full details of the plan tomorrow .
the bbc understands that the government bonds would have a maturity of up to a year , but would be rolled over for up to three years .
these would meet banks ' demands for longer term loans , while escaping being accounted for in the national debt .

" the bank of england will be lending the money , so it 's got to be repaid , and we will take securities in return for it , " he said .
but liberal democrat treasury spokesman vince cable expressed concern that the government was offering the banks too good a deal .
" we can not have a situation where the banks are able to privatise their profits and nationalise their losses , " he said .
" since the mortgages from the banks are of inferior quality and higher risk than the government bonds which they are replacing , the implication must be that taxpayers are shouldering the risks and losses of the banks .
" we need urgent reassurances from the government that the exchange is taking place on a discounted basis so that the banks and not taxpayers carry any losses . "
' reveal exposure ' banks are increasingly unwilling to lend to one another because of uncertainty over the exposure which they have to the us sub-prime mortgage market .
the banks have been asking for longer term finance from the bank of england to fill their funding gap following the collapse of the market for mortgage-backed securities last august .
the disappearance of this market deprived banks of tens of billions of pounds of finance for mortgage lending and is one of the main reasons why the cost of mortgages for many homeowners has been rising , even though the bank of england has been cutting its base lending rate .
mr darling said it was important that the banks began to reveal the extent of their losses as a result of exposure to the sub-prime market - as well as how they were going to rebuild capital .
britain 's second largest bank , royal bank of scotland , is to ask shareholders for about £ 10bn of extra cash to improve its financial position .
other institutions were likely to follow suit , the chancellor said .
" the sooner there is more openness and transparency and banks understand the extent of what happened to them since last summer , the more chance there is of getting ourselves back to the stability and normality that we need , " he said .
the chancellor will announce full details of the plan tomorrow .
the bbc understands that the government bonds would have a maturity of up to a year , but would be rolled over for up to three years .
these would meet banks ' demands for longer term loans , while escaping being accounted for in the national debt .
