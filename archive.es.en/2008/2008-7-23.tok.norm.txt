" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .

i recommend four intravenous injections ...

genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 23.07.2008 merkel backs baghdad on return of iraqi refugees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki got assurances from merkel on the estimated 73,000 iraqi exiles in germany iraqi prime minister al-maliki , who says he 's optimistic about german firms investing in his conflict-torn nation , also won the backing of chancellor merkel for plans to return iraqi refugees home earlier than planned . al-maliki , who is on a trip to germany and italy this week to drum up foreign investment , was keen to present a new image of his violence-riddled country and invite european companies to invest in his country . " iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .

federal prosecutors in germany say crime-scene dna samples from what went down in history as one of the raf 's most notorious killings do not match the former member of the terrorist group .
prosecutors ' spokesman frank wallenta said tuesday , july 22 , that new analysis of the dna samples taken from a motorcycle helmet and jacket show that they are not those of verena becker .
the apparel was worn during the assassination in karlsruhe of siegfried buback on april 7 , 1977 along with two other people .
the new investigation was opened after witnesses said a woman might have been on the motorcycle used in the attack .
the victim 's son , michael buback , is also reported to have suspected becker , who voluntarily gave dna samples for comparison .
germany 's terrorist past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker among those convicted in relation to buback 's murder is former raf member christian klar .
amidst widespread media controversy , german president horst koehler had considered pardoning him after he filed a pardon application several years ago , but on may 7 , 2007 , this was denied .
the red army faction was one of post-war west germany 's most prominent militant left-wing groups , described by the west german government as terrorists .
formally founded in 1970 by andreas baader , gudrun ensslin , horst mahler , ulrike meinhof and irmgard möller , it operated from the 1970s to 1993 and was responsible for 34 deaths including many secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .
but our own economy is improving , so returning refugees can expect to earn a living so they can support their families . interview : ibrahim mohamed -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .
but our own economy is improving , so returning refugees can expect to earn a living so they can support their families . interview : ibrahim mohamed -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .

" the fight against high-level corruption and organized crime is not producing enough results , " chief spokesman johannes laitenberger told reporters while unveiling two reports on bulgaria . penalties total nearly half a billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports showed bulgaria had not made as much progress as expected fighting organized crime the eu commission withdrew the accreditation of two bulgarian government agencies , which in effect stops payments of some 250 million euros -lrb- $ 394 million -rrb- earmarked to build up institutions in the country . in addition 115 million euros in funding chiefly meant for highway construction were put on ice .
a freeze was also imposed on 121 million euros for bulgaria 's agricultural sector . besides taking sofia to task , the commission also criticized romania , which joined the eu along with bulgaria at the outset of 2007 . the move by the eu came as the political opposition in sofia 's parliament called for a no-confidence vote in the government of socialist premier sergei stanishev .
the rightist opposition charged the government with responsibility for having inflicted " moral and financial damage " on the country and its people through sofia 's poor management of its european affairs . former interim premier stefan sofijanski said the eu 's report on bulgaria and the mood in the country had laid bare the presidency and government in sofia . the no-confidence vote motion is the sixth that the rightist parties have presented since the current cabinet took power in august 2005 . previously , the opposition parties had agreed to stage a " joint national protest " in the autumn in order to topple the government and push for new elections . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 23.07.2008 report says serbian intelligence protected karadzic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalist supporters of karadzic clashed with riot police in belgrade serbia 's intelligence service protected war crimes suspect radovan karadzic , whose capture after 12 years on the run was welcomed across europe , local media reported wednesday . " the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic lived incognito in belgrade for years prior to his arrest their supporters and other nationalists protesting karadzic 's arrest trashed businesses and clashed with police tuesday evening in downtown belgrade and plan to gather again on wednesday afternoon .
prior to his arrest , karadzic was living and working freely in belgrade as an alternative medicine specialist in a private clinic under a false name dragan david dabic .
karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .
he grew long , white hair and a beard , which enabled him to travel around the country undetected and attend medical congresses and seminars .
karadzic 's arrest was welcomed by serbian and european union officials as a step towards eu membership for the balkan country . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic lived incognito in belgrade for years prior to his arrest their supporters and other nationalists protesting karadzic 's arrest trashed businesses and clashed with police tuesday evening in downtown belgrade and plan to gather again on wednesday afternoon .
prior to his arrest , karadzic was living and working freely in belgrade as an alternative medicine specialist in a private clinic under a false name dragan david dabic .
karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .
he grew long , white hair and a beard , which enabled him to travel around the country undetected and attend medical congresses and seminars .

but never fear !
oktoberfest director gabriele weishaeupl says that some 60 percent of the 103,000 seats available ca n't actually be reserved , and if visitors come during the day , then they 'll definitely be able to put their feet up .
it will , however , be a more expensive pleasure than ever .
with a liter of suds costing over 8 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- , prices have gone up by 40 cents since last year .
moreover , the grounds for the event touted as the world 's biggest funfair have been reduced from 31 to 26 hectares .
smoking reprieve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this , and cigarettes too at least visitors will be able to smoke this year after the bavarian cabinet agreed to relax the smoking ban that came into force in january .
under the reprieve , beer tents and those serving wine or used for special functions will be exempted from the smoking ban for 12 months .

the court said marriage was a lifelong bond . germany 's parliament was instructed to amend the invalid law by august 1 , 2009 .
judges said parliament could prescribe that the man 's marriage be converted into a same-sex marriage .
germany recognizes marriage-style unions between homosexuals . the court said the main thing was that all the rights acquired from the man 's decades-old marriage must be preserved and continued . he should not have to start a blank page with the same-sex union . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .
dhl said that it expected " no consequence whatsoever on the operational day-to-day business nor on dhl 's decision to operate the central european hub in leipzig for the long term .

" after examining the operation , the commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " europe 's top anti-trust watchdog said in a statement .
porsche has said since early march that it planned to take over vw , europe 's biggest automaker , and has been waiting for the approval of various competition authorities .

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

federal prosecutors in germany say crime-scene dna samples from what went down in history as one of the raf 's most notorious killings do not match the former member of the terrorist group .
prosecutors ' spokesman frank wallenta said tuesday , july 22 , that new analysis of the dna samples taken from a motorcycle helmet and jacket show that they are not those of verena becker .
the apparel was worn during the assassination in karlsruhe of siegfried buback on april 7 , 1977 along with two other people .
the new investigation was opened after witnesses said a woman might have been on the motorcycle used in the attack .
the victim 's son , michael buback , is also reported to have suspected becker , who voluntarily gave dna samples for comparison .
germany 's terrorist past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker among those convicted in relation to buback 's murder is former raf member christian klar .
amidst widespread media controversy , german president horst koehler had considered pardoning him after he filed a pardon application several years ago , but on may 7 , 2007 , this was denied .
the red army faction was one of post-war west germany 's most prominent militant left-wing groups , described by the west german government as terrorists .
formally founded in 1970 by andreas baader , gudrun ensslin , horst mahler , ulrike meinhof and irmgard möller , it operated from the 1970s to 1993 and was responsible for 34 deaths including many secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .
but our own economy is improving , so returning refugees can expect to earn a living so they can support their families . interview : ibrahim mohamed -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .

even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .
now the democratic candidate hopes that huge crowds of cheering supporters , mostly foreign , at victory column will help him win november 's election in the us . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .

the court said marriage was a lifelong bond . germany 's parliament was instructed to amend the invalid law by august 1 , 2009 .
judges said parliament could prescribe that the man 's marriage be converted into a same-sex marriage .
germany recognizes marriage-style unions between homosexuals . the court said the main thing was that all the rights acquired from the man 's decades-old marriage must be preserved and continued . he should not have to start a blank page with the same-sex union . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 23.07.2008 german documentary reveals possible genetic doping in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of stem cell research being perverted for doping has caused shock waves a german television documentary suggesting that genetic doping is possible in the olympic host country of china has been met with shock and disgust by scientists and doping officials . " i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .
" but after the games business will be much easier again . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .

" they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals .

" after examining the operation , the commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " europe 's top anti-trust watchdog said in a statement .
porsche has said since early march that it planned to take over vw , europe 's biggest automaker , and has been waiting for the approval of various competition authorities .
earlier this month , porsche said it wants to build up its vw stake to almost 36 percent by early september , giving it power to set the agenda at vw general assemblies .
a porsche spokesman said at the time that the company aimed to gradually lift its stake to over 50 percent once authorities had given their blessing .
" the commission 's examination of the transaction showed that horizontal overlaps between volkswagen and porsche are limited and that , for all car segments concerned , porsche will continue to face several strong , effective competitors , " the eu regulator said .
" the commission also considered potential effects of the merger on the markets for the manufacture and supply of spare parts and on distribution markets but concluded that the transaction would not lead to any negative effects on these markets , " it added .
porsche 's fight for control not over porsche is seeking separately to counter efforts by the german government and the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , to retain a blocking minority held by the state , which owns around 20 percent of the shares in vw .
in june , the commission gave berlin until early august to change the law shielding vw from hostile takeovers and threatened otherwise to challenge it before an eu court , where germany already lost one case on the law .
earlier wednesday , vw posted a 31-percent gain in first-half net profit on strong sales in emerging markets , pushing its share price above 200 euros for the first time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .

" i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .

genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .

the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .
now the democratic candidate hopes that huge crowds of cheering supporters , mostly foreign , at victory column will help him win november 's election in the us . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .
" but after the games business will be much easier again . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after examining the operation , the commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " europe 's top anti-trust watchdog said in a statement .
porsche has said since early march that it planned to take over vw , europe 's biggest automaker , and has been waiting for the approval of various competition authorities .
earlier this month , porsche said it wants to build up its vw stake to almost 36 percent by early september , giving it power to set the agenda at vw general assemblies .
a porsche spokesman said at the time that the company aimed to gradually lift its stake to over 50 percent once authorities had given their blessing .
" the commission 's examination of the transaction showed that horizontal overlaps between volkswagen and porsche are limited and that , for all car segments concerned , porsche will continue to face several strong , effective competitors , " the eu regulator said .
" the commission also considered potential effects of the merger on the markets for the manufacture and supply of spare parts and on distribution markets but concluded that the transaction would not lead to any negative effects on these markets , " it added .
porsche 's fight for control not over porsche is seeking separately to counter efforts by the german government and the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , to retain a blocking minority held by the state , which owns around 20 percent of the shares in vw .
in june , the commission gave berlin until early august to change the law shielding vw from hostile takeovers and threatened otherwise to challenge it before an eu court , where germany already lost one case on the law .
earlier wednesday , vw posted a 31-percent gain in first-half net profit on strong sales in emerging markets , pushing its share price above 200 euros for the first time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .
dhl said that it expected " no consequence whatsoever on the operational day-to-day business nor on dhl 's decision to operate the central european hub in leipzig for the long term .

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .
immigrants groups against citizenship test the german cabinet also formally approved a new citizenship test for would-be germans that has angered immigrant groups in the country .
those applying for a german passport will in future have to undergo a written test and answer at least 17 of 33 multiple choice questions on german history , culture and politicians correctly to pass .
the exam will cost applicants 25 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- for a try and they will be given the questions beforehand to study .

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .
immigrants groups against citizenship test the german cabinet also formally approved a new citizenship test for would-be germans that has angered immigrant groups in the country .

the exam will cost applicants 25 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- for a try and they will be given the questions beforehand to study .

" the fight against high-level corruption and organized crime is not producing enough results , " chief spokesman johannes laitenberger told reporters while unveiling two reports on bulgaria . penalties total nearly half a billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports showed bulgaria had not made as much progress as expected fighting organized crime the eu commission withdrew the accreditation of two bulgarian government agencies , which in effect stops payments of some 250 million euros -lrb- $ 394 million -rrb- earmarked to build up institutions in the country . in addition 115 million euros in funding chiefly meant for highway construction were put on ice .
a freeze was also imposed on 121 million euros for bulgaria 's agricultural sector . besides taking sofia to task , the commission also criticized romania , which joined the eu along with bulgaria at the outset of 2007 . the move by the eu came as the political opposition in sofia 's parliament called for a no-confidence vote in the government of socialist premier sergei stanishev .
the rightist opposition charged the government with responsibility for having inflicted " moral and financial damage " on the country and its people through sofia 's poor management of its european affairs . former interim premier stefan sofijanski said the eu 's report on bulgaria and the mood in the country had laid bare the presidency and government in sofia . the no-confidence vote motion is the sixth that the rightist parties have presented since the current cabinet took power in august 2005 . previously , the opposition parties had agreed to stage a " joint national protest " in the autumn in order to topple the government and push for new elections . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .
dhl said that it expected " no consequence whatsoever on the operational day-to-day business nor on dhl 's decision to operate the central european hub in leipzig for the long term .

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .
immigrants groups against citizenship test the german cabinet also formally approved a new citizenship test for would-be germans that has angered immigrant groups in the country .
those applying for a german passport will in future have to undergo a written test and answer at least 17 of 33 multiple choice questions on german history , culture and politicians correctly to pass .
the exam will cost applicants 25 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- for a try and they will be given the questions beforehand to study .
critics of the test say it is too difficult and doubt whether even germans would be able to pass it .
germany has an estimated seven million permanent residents without a german passport .
germany 's 2.3-million strong turkish community has been especially critical of the test and prominent representatives for the group have lobbied the german government for the right to keep both turkish and german passports . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .

" i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .

genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .
" but after the games business will be much easier again . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .
immigrants groups against citizenship test the german cabinet also formally approved a new citizenship test for would-be germans that has angered immigrant groups in the country .
those applying for a german passport will in future have to undergo a written test and answer at least 17 of 33 multiple choice questions on german history , culture and politicians correctly to pass .
the exam will cost applicants 25 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- for a try and they will be given the questions beforehand to study .
critics of the test say it is too difficult and doubt whether even germans would be able to pass it .
germany has an estimated seven million permanent residents without a german passport .

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .

it now transpires this figure might be well off the mark - and can be explained by german bureacracy . government statisticians said tuesday , july 22 , that they think 1 million germans simply do n't exist , with long-time statistics on germany 's population out of sync with reality .
everyone living in germany , citizen or alien , is meant to register their name and address at a local government office , and de-register themselves and their children when they move away .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden uses the comings and goings to alter a 1987 west german census tally and numbers compiled in 1981 in communist east germany .
ghost residents the office said tuesday it believed the current population tally of 82.2 million was too high by 1.3 million because many people had failed to de-register themselves when moving to new homes .
they remained on the books as " card-index ghosts . "

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .
now the democratic candidate hopes that huge crowds of cheering supporters , mostly foreign , at victory column will help him win november 's election in the us . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .
now the democratic candidate hopes that huge crowds of cheering supporters , mostly foreign , at victory column will help him win november 's election in the us . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .
now the democratic candidate hopes that huge crowds of cheering supporters , mostly foreign , at victory column will help him win november 's election in the us . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .

karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic lived incognito in belgrade for years prior to his arrest their supporters and other nationalists protesting karadzic 's arrest trashed businesses and clashed with police tuesday evening in downtown belgrade and plan to gather again on wednesday afternoon .
prior to his arrest , karadzic was living and working freely in belgrade as an alternative medicine specialist in a private clinic under a false name dragan david dabic .
karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .
he grew long , white hair and a beard , which enabled him to travel around the country undetected and attend medical congresses and seminars .
karadzic 's arrest was welcomed by serbian and european union officials as a step towards eu membership for the balkan country . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .

" the fight against high-level corruption and organized crime is not producing enough results , " chief spokesman johannes laitenberger told reporters while unveiling two reports on bulgaria . penalties total nearly half a billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports showed bulgaria had not made as much progress as expected fighting organized crime the eu commission withdrew the accreditation of two bulgarian government agencies , which in effect stops payments of some 250 million euros -lrb- $ 394 million -rrb- earmarked to build up institutions in the country . in addition 115 million euros in funding chiefly meant for highway construction were put on ice .
a freeze was also imposed on 121 million euros for bulgaria 's agricultural sector . besides taking sofia to task , the commission also criticized romania , which joined the eu along with bulgaria at the outset of 2007 . the move by the eu came as the political opposition in sofia 's parliament called for a no-confidence vote in the government of socialist premier sergei stanishev .
the rightist opposition charged the government with responsibility for having inflicted " moral and financial damage " on the country and its people through sofia 's poor management of its european affairs . former interim premier stefan sofijanski said the eu 's report on bulgaria and the mood in the country had laid bare the presidency and government in sofia . the no-confidence vote motion is the sixth that the rightist parties have presented since the current cabinet took power in august 2005 . previously , the opposition parties had agreed to stage a " joint national protest " in the autumn in order to topple the government and push for new elections . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after examining the operation , the commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " europe 's top anti-trust watchdog said in a statement .
porsche has said since early march that it planned to take over vw , europe 's biggest automaker , and has been waiting for the approval of various competition authorities .
earlier this month , porsche said it wants to build up its vw stake to almost 36 percent by early september , giving it power to set the agenda at vw general assemblies .
a porsche spokesman said at the time that the company aimed to gradually lift its stake to over 50 percent once authorities had given their blessing .
" the commission 's examination of the transaction showed that horizontal overlaps between volkswagen and porsche are limited and that , for all car segments concerned , porsche will continue to face several strong , effective competitors , " the eu regulator said .
" the commission also considered potential effects of the merger on the markets for the manufacture and supply of spare parts and on distribution markets but concluded that the transaction would not lead to any negative effects on these markets , " it added .
porsche 's fight for control not over porsche is seeking separately to counter efforts by the german government and the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , to retain a blocking minority held by the state , which owns around 20 percent of the shares in vw .
in june , the commission gave berlin until early august to change the law shielding vw from hostile takeovers and threatened otherwise to challenge it before an eu court , where germany already lost one case on the law .

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .
dhl said that it expected " no consequence whatsoever on the operational day-to-day business nor on dhl 's decision to operate the central european hub in leipzig for the long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 23.07.2008 german documentary reveals possible genetic doping in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of stem cell research being perverted for doping has caused shock waves a german television documentary suggesting that genetic doping is possible in the olympic host country of china has been met with shock and disgust by scientists and doping officials . " i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .
" but after the games business will be much easier again . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

federal prosecutors in germany say crime-scene dna samples from what went down in history as one of the raf 's most notorious killings do not match the former member of the terrorist group .
prosecutors ' spokesman frank wallenta said tuesday , july 22 , that new analysis of the dna samples taken from a motorcycle helmet and jacket show that they are not those of verena becker .
the apparel was worn during the assassination in karlsruhe of siegfried buback on april 7 , 1977 along with two other people .
the new investigation was opened after witnesses said a woman might have been on the motorcycle used in the attack .
the victim 's son , michael buback , is also reported to have suspected becker , who voluntarily gave dna samples for comparison .

amidst widespread media controversy , german president horst koehler had considered pardoning him after he filed a pardon application several years ago , but on may 7 , 2007 , this was denied .
the red army faction was one of post-war west germany 's most prominent militant left-wing groups , described by the west german government as terrorists .

not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .

there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .

it now transpires this figure might be well off the mark - and can be explained by german bureacracy . government statisticians said tuesday , july 22 , that they think 1 million germans simply do n't exist , with long-time statistics on germany 's population out of sync with reality .
everyone living in germany , citizen or alien , is meant to register their name and address at a local government office , and de-register themselves and their children when they move away .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden uses the comings and goings to alter a 1987 west german census tally and numbers compiled in 1981 in communist east germany .
ghost residents the office said tuesday it believed the current population tally of 82.2 million was too high by 1.3 million because many people had failed to de-register themselves when moving to new homes .
they remained on the books as " card-index ghosts . "

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .

" i 'm proud and honored to be involved , " said schendel of his engagement for the highest of high culture events . stunt men are a rarity in any opera house , but especially at a wagner performance where music and meaning are the focus . the annual festival at bayreuth is run by descendants of composer richard wagner and is gently experimenting this year with such 21st century ideas as live streaming to a paying online audience . surprise saved for the audience precisely what schendel has to do is still a secret : the effect is meant to be a surprise for german chancellor angela merkel and other vip guests who turn up in ball gowns and tuxedos for the opening night . schendel , who has been in the stunts profession since 1995 , recalls , " when i was a kid i wanted to be a stunt man . " i used to copy stunts by my heroes like colt seavers , " he said , referring to a fictional stunt man in a us television series , the fall guy . schendel dropped out of his studies , learned to be a camera-man so he could get a foot in the door of the film business , and joined a stunt team to develop a repertoire of stunts . he became the head of a group in 2000 and registered it as a firm , vipstuntcamf , which won contracts in germany and abroad . he has worked on movies in which stars including natalie portman , susan sarandon and john goodman have played . next role : would-be hitler assassin he is set to appear fleetingly next year in valkyrie , the movie about a true-life plot to assassinate adolf hitler , as a nazi officer blown up by the bomb . schendel 's appearance in wagner 's parsifal will last just a few moments , but is complicated enough .
every wagner festival offers a fresh staging of one of the composer 's works , with the rest of the month-long program reprising previous years ' productions from the festival repertoire .
this year parsifal is up for the honor . " fortunately i do n't have to sing , " said schendel .
he takes over ventris ' role to make his long leap down to soft mats devised by fellow german stunt man christian gneissel to cushion the impact . the player who gets back to his feet again and continues singing will be ventris , of course , not schendel , but the audience will probably not even notice the illusion . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .
but our own economy is improving , so returning refugees can expect to earn a living so they can support their families . interview : ibrahim mohamed -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from january 1 , 2009 the smoking ban will be enforced in the tents , " said bavarian prime minister guenther beckstein .
it would have marked the first time in the oktoberfest 's 200-year history that people would not be allowed to smoke in the massive beer tents , some of which can accommodate up to 10,000 guests .
ending on october 5 , the event is expected to attract over 6 million visitors . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm proud and honored to be involved , " said schendel of his engagement for the highest of high culture events . stunt men are a rarity in any opera house , but especially at a wagner performance where music and meaning are the focus . the annual festival at bayreuth is run by descendants of composer richard wagner and is gently experimenting this year with such 21st century ideas as live streaming to a paying online audience . surprise saved for the audience precisely what schendel has to do is still a secret : the effect is meant to be a surprise for german chancellor angela merkel and other vip guests who turn up in ball gowns and tuxedos for the opening night . schendel , who has been in the stunts profession since 1995 , recalls , " when i was a kid i wanted to be a stunt man . " i used to copy stunts by my heroes like colt seavers , " he said , referring to a fictional stunt man in a us television series , the fall guy . schendel dropped out of his studies , learned to be a camera-man so he could get a foot in the door of the film business , and joined a stunt team to develop a repertoire of stunts . he became the head of a group in 2000 and registered it as a firm , vipstuntcamf , which won contracts in germany and abroad . he has worked on movies in which stars including natalie portman , susan sarandon and john goodman have played . next role : would-be hitler assassin he is set to appear fleetingly next year in valkyrie , the movie about a true-life plot to assassinate adolf hitler , as a nazi officer blown up by the bomb . schendel 's appearance in wagner 's parsifal will last just a few moments , but is complicated enough .
every wagner festival offers a fresh staging of one of the composer 's works , with the rest of the month-long program reprising previous years ' productions from the festival repertoire .
this year parsifal is up for the honor . " fortunately i do n't have to sing , " said schendel .
he takes over ventris ' role to make his long leap down to soft mats devised by fellow german stunt man christian gneissel to cushion the impact . the player who gets back to his feet again and continues singing will be ventris , of course , not schendel , but the audience will probably not even notice the illusion . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 23.07.2008 german documentary reveals possible genetic doping in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of stem cell research being perverted for doping has caused shock waves a german television documentary suggesting that genetic doping is possible in the olympic host country of china has been met with shock and disgust by scientists and doping officials . " i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .
" but after the games business will be much easier again . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .
immigrants groups against citizenship test the german cabinet also formally approved a new citizenship test for would-be germans that has angered immigrant groups in the country .
those applying for a german passport will in future have to undergo a written test and answer at least 17 of 33 multiple choice questions on german history , culture and politicians correctly to pass .
the exam will cost applicants 25 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- for a try and they will be given the questions beforehand to study .
critics of the test say it is too difficult and doubt whether even germans would be able to pass it .
germany has an estimated seven million permanent residents without a german passport .
germany 's 2.3-million strong turkish community has been especially critical of the test and prominent representatives for the group have lobbied the german government for the right to keep both turkish and german passports . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .
but our own economy is improving , so returning refugees can expect to earn a living so they can support their families . interview : ibrahim mohamed -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm proud and honored to be involved , " said schendel of his engagement for the highest of high culture events . stunt men are a rarity in any opera house , but especially at a wagner performance where music and meaning are the focus . the annual festival at bayreuth is run by descendants of composer richard wagner and is gently experimenting this year with such 21st century ideas as live streaming to a paying online audience . surprise saved for the audience precisely what schendel has to do is still a secret : the effect is meant to be a surprise for german chancellor angela merkel and other vip guests who turn up in ball gowns and tuxedos for the opening night . schendel , who has been in the stunts profession since 1995 , recalls , " when i was a kid i wanted to be a stunt man . " i used to copy stunts by my heroes like colt seavers , " he said , referring to a fictional stunt man in a us television series , the fall guy . schendel dropped out of his studies , learned to be a camera-man so he could get a foot in the door of the film business , and joined a stunt team to develop a repertoire of stunts . he became the head of a group in 2000 and registered it as a firm , vipstuntcamf , which won contracts in germany and abroad . he has worked on movies in which stars including natalie portman , susan sarandon and john goodman have played . next role : would-be hitler assassin he is set to appear fleetingly next year in valkyrie , the movie about a true-life plot to assassinate adolf hitler , as a nazi officer blown up by the bomb . schendel 's appearance in wagner 's parsifal will last just a few moments , but is complicated enough .
every wagner festival offers a fresh staging of one of the composer 's works , with the rest of the month-long program reprising previous years ' productions from the festival repertoire .
this year parsifal is up for the honor . " fortunately i do n't have to sing , " said schendel .
he takes over ventris ' role to make his long leap down to soft mats devised by fellow german stunt man christian gneissel to cushion the impact . the player who gets back to his feet again and continues singing will be ventris , of course , not schendel , but the audience will probably not even notice the illusion . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it now transpires this figure might be well off the mark - and can be explained by german bureacracy . government statisticians said tuesday , july 22 , that they think 1 million germans simply do n't exist , with long-time statistics on germany 's population out of sync with reality .
everyone living in germany , citizen or alien , is meant to register their name and address at a local government office , and de-register themselves and their children when they move away .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden uses the comings and goings to alter a 1987 west german census tally and numbers compiled in 1981 in communist east germany .
ghost residents the office said tuesday it believed the current population tally of 82.2 million was too high by 1.3 million because many people had failed to de-register themselves when moving to new homes .
they remained on the books as " card-index ghosts . "
during the european union census of 2011 , germany plans to calculate its population using estimates from the registers , welfare records , mail-carrier records and a detailed survey of a small sample of the population . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 23.07.2008 german documentary reveals possible genetic doping in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of stem cell research being perverted for doping has caused shock waves a german television documentary suggesting that genetic doping is possible in the olympic host country of china has been met with shock and disgust by scientists and doping officials . " i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .
" but after the games business will be much easier again . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .
but our own economy is improving , so returning refugees can expect to earn a living so they can support their families . interview : ibrahim mohamed -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .

reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .

many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .
immigrants groups against citizenship test the german cabinet also formally approved a new citizenship test for would-be germans that has angered immigrant groups in the country .

the exam will cost applicants 25 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- for a try and they will be given the questions beforehand to study .

" i 'm proud and honored to be involved , " said schendel of his engagement for the highest of high culture events . stunt men are a rarity in any opera house , but especially at a wagner performance where music and meaning are the focus . the annual festival at bayreuth is run by descendants of composer richard wagner and is gently experimenting this year with such 21st century ideas as live streaming to a paying online audience . surprise saved for the audience precisely what schendel has to do is still a secret : the effect is meant to be a surprise for german chancellor angela merkel and other vip guests who turn up in ball gowns and tuxedos for the opening night . schendel , who has been in the stunts profession since 1995 , recalls , " when i was a kid i wanted to be a stunt man . " i used to copy stunts by my heroes like colt seavers , " he said , referring to a fictional stunt man in a us television series , the fall guy . schendel dropped out of his studies , learned to be a camera-man so he could get a foot in the door of the film business , and joined a stunt team to develop a repertoire of stunts . he became the head of a group in 2000 and registered it as a firm , vipstuntcamf , which won contracts in germany and abroad . he has worked on movies in which stars including natalie portman , susan sarandon and john goodman have played . next role : would-be hitler assassin he is set to appear fleetingly next year in valkyrie , the movie about a true-life plot to assassinate adolf hitler , as a nazi officer blown up by the bomb . schendel 's appearance in wagner 's parsifal will last just a few moments , but is complicated enough .
every wagner festival offers a fresh staging of one of the composer 's works , with the rest of the month-long program reprising previous years ' productions from the festival repertoire .
this year parsifal is up for the honor . " fortunately i do n't have to sing , " said schendel .
he takes over ventris ' role to make his long leap down to soft mats devised by fellow german stunt man christian gneissel to cushion the impact . the player who gets back to his feet again and continues singing will be ventris , of course , not schendel , but the audience will probably not even notice the illusion . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic lived incognito in belgrade for years prior to his arrest their supporters and other nationalists protesting karadzic 's arrest trashed businesses and clashed with police tuesday evening in downtown belgrade and plan to gather again on wednesday afternoon .
prior to his arrest , karadzic was living and working freely in belgrade as an alternative medicine specialist in a private clinic under a false name dragan david dabic .
karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .
he grew long , white hair and a beard , which enabled him to travel around the country undetected and attend medical congresses and seminars .

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .

prior to his arrest , karadzic was living and working freely in belgrade as an alternative medicine specialist in a private clinic under a false name dragan david dabic .
karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .
he grew long , white hair and a beard , which enabled him to travel around the country undetected and attend medical congresses and seminars .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 23.07.2008 eu rejects state aid for german cargo carrier dhl großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission says dhl enjoys an unfair advantage over rivals eu comission regulators wednesday blocked germany from offering german express delivery giant dhl state guarantees worth up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 789million -rrb- to help set up its european hub at the leipzig-halle airport . the european commission in brussels on wednesday , july 23 ruled that the guarantees by the government of the federal german state of saxony violated eu state aid rules as they " allowed dhl to hedge business risks on terms which a private investor would not have accepted . "
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .

" after examining the operation , the commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " europe 's top anti-trust watchdog said in a statement .
porsche has said since early march that it planned to take over vw , europe 's biggest automaker , and has been waiting for the approval of various competition authorities .
earlier this month , porsche said it wants to build up its vw stake to almost 36 percent by early september , giving it power to set the agenda at vw general assemblies .
a porsche spokesman said at the time that the company aimed to gradually lift its stake to over 50 percent once authorities had given their blessing .
" the commission 's examination of the transaction showed that horizontal overlaps between volkswagen and porsche are limited and that , for all car segments concerned , porsche will continue to face several strong , effective competitors , " the eu regulator said .
" the commission also considered potential effects of the merger on the markets for the manufacture and supply of spare parts and on distribution markets but concluded that the transaction would not lead to any negative effects on these markets , " it added .
porsche 's fight for control not over porsche is seeking separately to counter efforts by the german government and the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , to retain a blocking minority held by the state , which owns around 20 percent of the shares in vw .
in june , the commission gave berlin until early august to change the law shielding vw from hostile takeovers and threatened otherwise to challenge it before an eu court , where germany already lost one case on the law .
earlier wednesday , vw posted a 31-percent gain in first-half net profit on strong sales in emerging markets , pushing its share price above 200 euros for the first time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

federal prosecutors in germany say crime-scene dna samples from what went down in history as one of the raf 's most notorious killings do not match the former member of the terrorist group .
prosecutors ' spokesman frank wallenta said tuesday , july 22 , that new analysis of the dna samples taken from a motorcycle helmet and jacket show that they are not those of verena becker .
the apparel was worn during the assassination in karlsruhe of siegfried buback on april 7 , 1977 along with two other people .
the new investigation was opened after witnesses said a woman might have been on the motorcycle used in the attack .
the victim 's son , michael buback , is also reported to have suspected becker , who voluntarily gave dna samples for comparison .

the red army faction was one of post-war west germany 's most prominent militant left-wing groups , described by the west german government as terrorists .
formally founded in 1970 by andreas baader , gudrun ensslin , horst mahler , ulrike meinhof and irmgard möller , it operated from the 1970s to 1993 and was responsible for 34 deaths including many secondary targets such as chauffeurs and bodyguards . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .

" after examining the operation , the commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " europe 's top anti-trust watchdog said in a statement .
porsche has said since early march that it planned to take over vw , europe 's biggest automaker , and has been waiting for the approval of various competition authorities .
earlier this month , porsche said it wants to build up its vw stake to almost 36 percent by early september , giving it power to set the agenda at vw general assemblies .
a porsche spokesman said at the time that the company aimed to gradually lift its stake to over 50 percent once authorities had given their blessing .
" the commission 's examination of the transaction showed that horizontal overlaps between volkswagen and porsche are limited and that , for all car segments concerned , porsche will continue to face several strong , effective competitors , " the eu regulator said .
" the commission also considered potential effects of the merger on the markets for the manufacture and supply of spare parts and on distribution markets but concluded that the transaction would not lead to any negative effects on these markets , " it added .
porsche 's fight for control not over porsche is seeking separately to counter efforts by the german government and the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , to retain a blocking minority held by the state , which owns around 20 percent of the shares in vw .
in june , the commission gave berlin until early august to change the law shielding vw from hostile takeovers and threatened otherwise to challenge it before an eu court , where germany already lost one case on the law .

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .
dhl said that it expected " no consequence whatsoever on the operational day-to-day business nor on dhl 's decision to operate the central european hub in leipzig for the long term .

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .
dhl says unconcerned about guarantees decision dhl , owned by deutsche post , said it welcomed the decision on the contribution to the new runway and said it was n't concerned about the decision on the guarantees .
" ceo frank appel emphasized that deutsche post can live quite well with the commission 's decision today , " dhl said in a statement .
" we have obtained in the meantime the long-term security that dhl urgently needs at the leipzig location , " the statement quoted appel as saying .

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .
but our own economy is improving , so returning refugees can expect to earn a living so they can support their families . interview : ibrahim mohamed -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .
this has made people realize that the state makes no exceptions for any of its citizens .
then there are the comprehensive security measures that have been taken .
the coalition troops played a major role , but our newly established security forces in the police and the army , which have been purged of militias , have become increasingly professional .
they are aware of their responsibilities to the nation and are more effective than they once were . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq 's prime minister nouri al-maliki to what extent do you attribute the improved security situation in iraq to the presence of foreign troops ?
recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .
the government as well as international observers were confident that the iraqi army and police would be able to guarantee stability .
the coalition forces have confirmed this is the case and are proud that the iraqi army has proved able to bring the situation under control .
the proposed security pact between the us and iraq is very topical at the moment .
will it contain a timeframe for a us troop pull-out ?
dialogue between the two sides is ongoing .
initial drafts contain some very sweeping demands that have not been accepted .
but the political situation continues to change .
after a period of boycott , a number of iraqi ministers have resumed their work in the government .
political structures are crystallizing , security has improved and we have important challenges to rise to .
international troops can not remain in the country forever .
for some time we have been engaged in intensive dialogue regarding a timeframe for their mandate and a transitional preparation phase for their withdrawal .
all the iraqi parties , as well as the coalition forces , agree that the deployment must be limited and that responsibility needs to be handed over to the iraqis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basra is under iraqi control do you think the current situation in iraq is stable enough for international companies to return and take part in the reconstruction of the country ?
i personally visited japan , korea and other countries specifically to persuade companies to invest in our electricity , fuel and oil sectors .
none of them responded to this call , because their governments do n't want them going to iraq because of the security situation .
observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .
to us , the most important sectors are electricity and crude oil .
reconstruction of these sectors would boost agriculture and industry and generally improve the iraqis ' standards of living .
but investors are nervous .
the companies will only come when circumstances allow .
we have provided an improved security situation , and we can also offer investors protection now that we have formed an investment authority for all the governorates , which protects investors and guarantees them favorable conditions .
the time has come to invest in iraq and a number of companies have already begun .
but hundreds of thousands of iraqis are still outside the country .
do n't they need to return before international companies will feel truly safe ? the media gets the facts wrong .
they fail to report on the many thousands of iraqis who return every day .
even the countries who maintain they took in one or two million iraqis in reality only took in 50,000 or 100,000 refugees .
many of them are now coming back , and we want to facilitate this process .
but if iraqis would rather emigrate , in order to study or work , for example , then we will not prevent them from doing so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 23.07.2008 merkel backs baghdad on return of iraqi refugees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al-maliki got assurances from merkel on the estimated 73,000 iraqi exiles in germany iraqi prime minister al-maliki , who says he 's optimistic about german firms investing in his conflict-torn nation , also won the backing of chancellor merkel for plans to return iraqi refugees home earlier than planned . al-maliki , who is on a trip to germany and italy this week to drum up foreign investment , was keen to present a new image of his violence-riddled country and invite european companies to invest in his country . " iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .

" i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .

genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .

" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .

" i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .

but never fear !
oktoberfest director gabriele weishaeupl says that some 60 percent of the 103,000 seats available ca n't actually be reserved , and if visitors come during the day , then they 'll definitely be able to put their feet up .
it will , however , be a more expensive pleasure than ever .
with a liter of suds costing over 8 euros -lrb- $ 13 -rrb- , prices have gone up by 40 cents since last year .
moreover , the grounds for the event touted as the world 's biggest funfair have been reduced from 31 to 26 hectares .
smoking reprieve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all this , and cigarettes too at least visitors will be able to smoke this year after the bavarian cabinet agreed to relax the smoking ban that came into force in january .

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after examining the operation , the commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition , " europe 's top anti-trust watchdog said in a statement .
porsche has said since early march that it planned to take over vw , europe 's biggest automaker , and has been waiting for the approval of various competition authorities .
earlier this month , porsche said it wants to build up its vw stake to almost 36 percent by early september , giving it power to set the agenda at vw general assemblies .
a porsche spokesman said at the time that the company aimed to gradually lift its stake to over 50 percent once authorities had given their blessing .
" the commission 's examination of the transaction showed that horizontal overlaps between volkswagen and porsche are limited and that , for all car segments concerned , porsche will continue to face several strong , effective competitors , " the eu regulator said .
" the commission also considered potential effects of the merger on the markets for the manufacture and supply of spare parts and on distribution markets but concluded that the transaction would not lead to any negative effects on these markets , " it added .
porsche 's fight for control not over porsche is seeking separately to counter efforts by the german government and the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , to retain a blocking minority held by the state , which owns around 20 percent of the shares in vw .
in june , the commission gave berlin until early august to change the law shielding vw from hostile takeovers and threatened otherwise to challenge it before an eu court , where germany already lost one case on the law .

porsche 's fight for control not over porsche is seeking separately to counter efforts by the german government and the state of lower saxony , where vw is based , to retain a blocking minority held by the state , which owns around 20 percent of the shares in vw .
in june , the commission gave berlin until early august to change the law shielding vw from hostile takeovers and threatened otherwise to challenge it before an eu court , where germany already lost one case on the law .
earlier wednesday , vw posted a 31-percent gain in first-half net profit on strong sales in emerging markets , pushing its share price above 200 euros for the first time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has played a major role in shaping iraq after the us invasion , helping draft the country 's new constitution , purging iraq of its baathist legacy and helping formulate agreements over the possible structure of a government that could unify iraq 's different religious and political groups .
deutsche welle : let 's start by talking about security in iraq .
the situation has begun to improve - is normality returning to iraq ?
nuri al-maliki : definitely .
on the one hand , as a result of reactions to the abhorrent activities of al-qaeda and the illegal militias , and on the other hand , because the iraqis have realized that they can in fact get along despite their various religious confessions and ethnicities .
the government has also shown that it will not tolerate lawlessness , regardless of confession .

recent successes in basra can be attributed to the iraqi security forces .
the iraqi government was in charge of the planning and the implementation .
iraqi security forces are more familiar with iraqi society and geography ; they know the extremists and they are very well-trained .

observers would confirm , however , that ministers from japan , germany , the us and britain have visited iraq , and that companies including ge and siemens are already operating there and competing in various sectors .

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic lived incognito in belgrade for years prior to his arrest their supporters and other nationalists protesting karadzic 's arrest trashed businesses and clashed with police tuesday evening in downtown belgrade and plan to gather again on wednesday afternoon .
prior to his arrest , karadzic was living and working freely in belgrade as an alternative medicine specialist in a private clinic under a false name dragan david dabic .
karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .
he grew long , white hair and a beard , which enabled him to travel around the country undetected and attend medical congresses and seminars .
karadzic 's arrest was welcomed by serbian and european union officials as a step towards eu membership for the balkan country . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic was slain in 2003 by milosevic 's special police djindjic was assassinated in 2003 by milosevic 's special police forces and milosevic died while in custody in the hague in 2006 .
djindjic 's successor , boris tadic , formed serbia 's ruling coalition with dacic less than two weeks ago .
the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .

prior to his arrest , karadzic was living and working freely in belgrade as an alternative medicine specialist in a private clinic under a false name dragan david dabic .
karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .
he grew long , white hair and a beard , which enabled him to travel around the country undetected and attend medical congresses and seminars .

the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague indicted karadzic with genocide and crimes against humanity during the 1992-95 bosnia war .
serbian war crimes court spokesman bruno vekaric said wednesday , july 23 , that karadzic will most likely be extradited to the hague over the weekend or at the beginning of next week .
vekaric could n't give a more precise date because karadzic 's lawyer svetozar vujacic plans to appeal on friday the decision to extradite karadzic .
" after that , court will have three days to decide on the appeal .
then the interior ministry has to sign the decision .
monday or tuesday are more realistic , but it can happen sooner , " vekaric told local media .
nationalists protest karadzic 's capture karadzic 's lawyer said karadzic will conduct his own defense at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague .
" karadzic will have a legal team here in serbia that will help him in his defense , but he will represent himself in the hague tribunal .
in the same maestro way as vojislav seselj , " vujacic told journalists in belgrade .
seselj , the leader of the serbian opposition ultranationalist radical party , is currently on trial in the hague on charges of murder , torture and persecution of non-serbs in bosnia and croatia during the 1990s wars .
he has refused a defense lawyer and is defending himself .
the radicals are the only serb party which did n't welcome karadzic 's arrest , which they compared to killing serbia .

karadzic also had his own website and supplemented his income by giving lectures on bio-energy and meditation , and writing for a magazine called healthy life .

" the secret service protected him , the secret service has now handed him over , " interior minister ivica dacic , who is in charge of the police , was quoted as saying by the daily press on wednesday , july 23 .
former bosnian serb leader karadzic was arrested on monday by serb security forces in the capital belgrade .
dacic , head of the late president slobodan milosevic 's socialist party , repeatedly denied that the police had anything to do with the arrest .
serbian authorities also denied that the police were involved in the arrest .
" not one policeman participated in the location or arrest of karadzic .
it was all done by security forces , " dacic told tanjug state agency .
karadzic to be extradited to the hague slobodan milosevic was extradited to the international tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague in 2001 by the then prime minister and head of the pro-european democratic party , zoran djindjic .

" i 'm proud and honored to be involved , " said schendel of his engagement for the highest of high culture events . stunt men are a rarity in any opera house , but especially at a wagner performance where music and meaning are the focus . the annual festival at bayreuth is run by descendants of composer richard wagner and is gently experimenting this year with such 21st century ideas as live streaming to a paying online audience . surprise saved for the audience precisely what schendel has to do is still a secret : the effect is meant to be a surprise for german chancellor angela merkel and other vip guests who turn up in ball gowns and tuxedos for the opening night . schendel , who has been in the stunts profession since 1995 , recalls , " when i was a kid i wanted to be a stunt man . " i used to copy stunts by my heroes like colt seavers , " he said , referring to a fictional stunt man in a us television series , the fall guy . schendel dropped out of his studies , learned to be a camera-man so he could get a foot in the door of the film business , and joined a stunt team to develop a repertoire of stunts . he became the head of a group in 2000 and registered it as a firm , vipstuntcamf , which won contracts in germany and abroad . he has worked on movies in which stars including natalie portman , susan sarandon and john goodman have played . next role : would-be hitler assassin he is set to appear fleetingly next year in valkyrie , the movie about a true-life plot to assassinate adolf hitler , as a nazi officer blown up by the bomb . schendel 's appearance in wagner 's parsifal will last just a few moments , but is complicated enough .
every wagner festival offers a fresh staging of one of the composer 's works , with the rest of the month-long program reprising previous years ' productions from the festival repertoire .

berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .

that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .

those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .

" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .

" the fight against high-level corruption and organized crime is not producing enough results , " chief spokesman johannes laitenberger told reporters while unveiling two reports on bulgaria . penalties total nearly half a billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports showed bulgaria had not made as much progress as expected fighting organized crime the eu commission withdrew the accreditation of two bulgarian government agencies , which in effect stops payments of some 250 million euros -lrb- $ 394 million -rrb- earmarked to build up institutions in the country . in addition 115 million euros in funding chiefly meant for highway construction were put on ice .
a freeze was also imposed on 121 million euros for bulgaria 's agricultural sector . besides taking sofia to task , the commission also criticized romania , which joined the eu along with bulgaria at the outset of 2007 . the move by the eu came as the political opposition in sofia 's parliament called for a no-confidence vote in the government of socialist premier sergei stanishev .
the rightist opposition charged the government with responsibility for having inflicted " moral and financial damage " on the country and its people through sofia 's poor management of its european affairs . former interim premier stefan sofijanski said the eu 's report on bulgaria and the mood in the country had laid bare the presidency and government in sofia . the no-confidence vote motion is the sixth that the rightist parties have presented since the current cabinet took power in august 2005 . previously , the opposition parties had agreed to stage a " joint national protest " in the autumn in order to topple the government and push for new elections . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fight against high-level corruption and organized crime is not producing enough results , " chief spokesman johannes laitenberger told reporters while unveiling two reports on bulgaria . penalties total nearly half a billion euros bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports showed bulgaria had not made as much progress as expected fighting organized crime the eu commission withdrew the accreditation of two bulgarian government agencies , which in effect stops payments of some 250 million euros -lrb- $ 394 million -rrb- earmarked to build up institutions in the country . in addition 115 million euros in funding chiefly meant for highway construction were put on ice .
a freeze was also imposed on 121 million euros for bulgaria 's agricultural sector . besides taking sofia to task , the commission also criticized romania , which joined the eu along with bulgaria at the outset of 2007 . the move by the eu came as the political opposition in sofia 's parliament called for a no-confidence vote in the government of socialist premier sergei stanishev .
the rightist opposition charged the government with responsibility for having inflicted " moral and financial damage " on the country and its people through sofia 's poor management of its european affairs . former interim premier stefan sofijanski said the eu 's report on bulgaria and the mood in the country had laid bare the presidency and government in sofia . the no-confidence vote motion is the sixth that the rightist parties have presented since the current cabinet took power in august 2005 . previously , the opposition parties had agreed to stage a " joint national protest " in the autumn in order to topple the government and push for new elections . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the commission opened a probe in november 2006 after german authorities informed eu regulators of plans to help build and operate the new runway at the airport , where dhl wants to set up its european express parcel hub .
europe 's top competition watchdog said the offer of up to 500 million euros of public money gave dhl an unfair advantage over its rivals .
it added that dhl has already benefited from the maximum amount of investment aid permissible for regions with an especially low standard of living and high unemployment .
the commission did however authorize 350 million euros of public investment for a new runway at leipzig halle airport .

" iraq has the foundation and is capable of taking the security situation into its own hands , " ' al-maliki told reporters at a joint news conference with merkel on wednesday , july 23 . " we can say with some pride that we 're in the position and capable - with our police and army and with our professional level - to achieve that . " al-maliki lobbies for swift return of iraqi refugees speaking to reporters after talks with chancellor merkel in berlin , al-maliki said he also wanted to encourage the thousands of iraqis who fled the spiraling violence in their country in recent years to return home without forcing them to do so .
his government did not discriminate between muslims and christians , or between sunnis and shias , he added . merkel confirmed in a press conference that baghdad had asked germany to review its position on refugees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to give preferential treatment to christian refugees from iraq the iraqi government has stated that the security situation is improving and that " it will adopt a program on the return of refugees within the next 60 days , " merkel said .
" i think we should back plans to see the greatest number return home , with necessary encouragements , " she said , adding that germany would brief its eu partners on the iraqi position at a meeting of interior ministers on thursday this week . the un high commissioner for refugees estimates that more than 73,000 iraqis live in exile in germany , of whom half have been granted asylum . some 4.4 million iraqis have fled their homes since the start of the war , with some two million currently living in neighboring countries , mostly jordan and syria , and some 2.5 million displaced within their own country . german firms test iraqi waters earlier al-maliki met with more than a 100 business leaders in berlin and the heads of several high-profile companies to convince them to invest in iraq where al-maliki said security had greatly improved .
violence in iraq has dropped to its lowest levels since early 2004 . " german companies have a right to hesitate ... but we think we can persuade them in the coming days that the security situation allows them to return , " maliki told a press conference on the second day of a visit to germany . the iraqi leader said he had invited the roughly 120 business leaders with whom he dined tuesday to send representatives to study the situation . " they said they were prepared to do so , " he added .
" we are in control of the situation in the country and are ready to ensure extra protection " to foreign companies , he said . despite reservations by many german companies about the continuing political instability and sporadic violence in iraq , al-maliki managed to score a few successes . germany 's daimler ag signed a memorandum of understanding with the iraqi government that could see the german vehicle maker supply buses , trucks and technological expertise in efforts to rebuild the country . daimler spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein told reuters a small number of daimler employees working out of an office in baghdad will research what the car maker might be able to offer to help the country rebuild , and whether the company might be able to invest more broadly in iraq . germany and iraq also signed an agreement to promote and protect mutual investment .
the accord signed by german economy minister michael glos and iraqi industry minister fawzi al-hariri , guarantees " effective protection of property , free transit of capital and revenues and access to international arbitrage in the event of disputes , " according to a statement issued by the economy ministry . it demonstrated " both countries ' wish to quickly promote investment , " the ministry said . cooperation in energy and infrastructure merkel said she was glad german companies , which have long eyed lucrative contracts in oil-rich iraq , had shown interest in al-maliki 's proposals . " we are pleased that several german firms are already interested in taking part in the reconstruction of iraq , " merkel said during a joint press conference on wednesday .
" the security situation in iraq is improving step by step , that is the condition necessary for political and economic reconstruction , " merkel said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with al-maliki in berlin the two leaders discussed cooperation in energy , infrastructure and training .
merkel said the presence of companies such as basf ag 's oil-and-gas arm wintershall in iraq could lead to more ventures involving german engineering and infrastructure expertise and a joint german-iraqi training program . iraqi leader speaks on us troop withdrawal al-maliki also told reporters in berlin on wednesday that his country and the united states are still in discussions about how long american troops will stay in the country . the " negotiations are still ongoing , " al-maliki said , added that there could be a " big step forward on the principles of the withdrawal . " al-maliki this week told visiting democratic presidential candidate barack obama he hopes us troops will be out of iraq by 2010 , though he did n't explicitly support obama 's plan to withdraw forces over 16 months . obama is scheduled to arrive in berlin on thursday , july 14 and will deliver a speech at a landmark in the city center . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it now transpires this figure might be well off the mark - and can be explained by german bureacracy . government statisticians said tuesday , july 22 , that they think 1 million germans simply do n't exist , with long-time statistics on germany 's population out of sync with reality .
everyone living in germany , citizen or alien , is meant to register their name and address at a local government office , and de-register themselves and their children when they move away .
the federal statistics office in wiesbaden uses the comings and goings to alter a 1987 west german census tally and numbers compiled in 1981 in communist east germany .
ghost residents the office said tuesday it believed the current population tally of 82.2 million was too high by 1.3 million because many people had failed to de-register themselves when moving to new homes .
they remained on the books as " card-index ghosts . "
during the european union census of 2011 , germany plans to calculate its population using estimates from the registers , welfare records , mail-carrier records and a detailed survey of a small sample of the population . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 23.07.2008 german documentary reveals possible genetic doping in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the possibility of stem cell research being perverted for doping has caused shock waves a german television documentary suggesting that genetic doping is possible in the olympic host country of china has been met with shock and disgust by scientists and doping officials . " i could never imagine this , " said mario thevis , head of a cologne-based center for preventive doping research , on tuesday , july 22 .
the documentary , entitled " flying high in middle kingdom , " broadcast on monday night by germany 's state-run ard network , showed a reporter , claiming to be a swimming coach , inquiring about performance-enhancing stem cell treatment for athletes in a chinese hospital .
filmed with a hidden camera , a doctor named a price of $ 24,000 and outlined the procedure .
the doctor said the treatment had not been tested among athletes but was safe - a fact disputed by others .
" yes .
we have no experience with athletes here , but the treatment is safe and we can help you , " the doctor is heard to say .
" it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs .
it takes two weeks .
i recommend four intravenous injections ...
40 million stem cells or double that , the more the better .
we also use human growth hormones , but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list . "
genetic doping expert patrick diel was shocked by the revelation : " there are huge health risks .
this is shocking .
i was surprised to see this .
honestly , this is beyond my worst fears . "
thevis expressed doubts whether such a treatment as described by the doctor would enhance the performance .
not science fiction , science fact toronto sports doctor mauro di pasquale said on the documentary that there was an ongoing trade in gene doping in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some claim that athletes have undergone gene doping " i know of several incidences - and this is from talking to coaches and other people that have direct knowledge - where several professional athletes in sports such as soccer , football and several amateur athletes even on the elite olympic level have gone to china and had gene doping performed , " he said .
" these doctors - i ca n't give the names - are involved in university clinics , they are involved in hospitals and they also have their personal clinics . "
however , the chinese sports ministry insists the government is determined to stamp out the illegal trade .
" on the issue of international criticism of the illegal trade in medication , the chinese government takes the issue very seriously and takes strong measures to fight that illegal trade , " said jiang zhixue , general secretary at the chinese sports ministry .
the general director of the world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- , david howman , expressed his disgust when confronted in the documentary with the alleged practices in china , which hosts the olympics august 8-24 in beijing .
howman spoke of " a terrible feeling " and named it shocking that health experts " showed such a lack of ethics and experimented with humans for a lot of money .
dangerous disregard of ethics " this is very distressing , " he said .
" it is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the work of law-abiding doctors is being undermined " that does n't match up to the standards that we ordinarily require of doctors and other medical practitioners , " howman told ard .
" this is even more dreadful , because what they are proposing to do is a total breach of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited .
" and it is very distressing to see that perhaps it 's been used now or could be used in a country where the magnificent event -lrb- the olympic games -rrb- will soon take place . "
the documentary makers also approached a chinese company , gensci , which agreed to supply steroids and epo .
in another undercover sting operation , the investigators spoke to a salesperson while filming covertly .
" the substance is a doping substance according to our government and that is why we are not supposed to sell this before the olympics , " the salesman is heard saying .
" but after the games business will be much easier again . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a small minority is questioning whether the democratic candidate can live up to the hype - or justify the costs . in the build-up to what is probably the most anticipated american campaign speech ever held on foreign soil , one of berlin 's main city magazines offered its readership cut-out american flags to wave at barack obama 's planned address .
the presumed democratic nominee plans to arrive in the german capital on thursday morning .
not much of his agenda for the day has been made public , but he is set to speak at berlin 's victory column - formerly the main site of the love parade - at 7:00 p.m. local time .
those who want to hear obama live have been told to start arriving three hours earlier .
berlin authorities say that as many as a million people could attend .
four tv stations are broadcasting the entire speech , and the rest are scrambling to secure prime locations at the site .
only around 13,000 americans live in berlin .
so what is motivating berliners and germans in general to treat a democratic presidential hopeful to such a royal welcome ?
he 's not bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama met with israeli 's and palestinians on wednesday ahead of his berlin trip in comparison to us elections , german political campaigns are short , stolid and sober affairs that focus as much on party platforms as personalities .
in the wake of world war ii , many germans view charismatic leadership with mistrust .
that , however , does n't mean that ordinary germans or the media are immune to the aura of a politician who knows how to work a crowd .
the current edition of germany 's most serious news weekly , der spiegel , features obama on its cover with the only vaguely ironic headline " germany meets the superstar " - a play on the title of the german version of the tv show " american idol . "
and many german bloggers do seem to idolize the illinois senator .
" for me he already is the american president , " wrote one user of a web site about obama 's berlin visit .
" he may not be have been elected , but he 's the president in people 's hearts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the posters for the event have drawn praise for their design a significant part of obama 's popularity in germany can be traced to the deep antipathy many germans feel toward george w. bush , particularly in the wake of the iraq war .
there is an undertone of relief among german politicians that bush will be gone in 2009 .
asked about obama 's visit , figures from all the major parties stressed their hopes for greater cooperation , partnership and closeness between germany and the us .
most german leaders have been careful not to stray beyond such generalisms to avoid affronting obama 's republican rival , john mccain , who has become a virtual non-entity in the german media .
but the green party 's deputy parliamentary leader voiced what many politicians , especially on the left , probably feel , when he told reporters , " barack obama 's visit shows : there is another america . "
no placards , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's opposition to the war is a big plus for him abroad but not everyone , of course , is euphoric about the conditions under which obama will appear in berlin .
those wishing to attend have been advised that signs and posters will be prohibited at the speech - a move that has come in for criticism particularly from the left .
there has been speculation that the obama camps wants to avoid pictures of germans making anti-american statements that could hurt the candidate back home .
others say the ban is aimed at preventing political activists from making demands of obama on uncomfortable issues .
the world wide fund for nature plans to flout the prohibition by issuing members t-shirts with pictures of polar bears and the words " yes , you can ! " as a way of encouraging obama to take a tougher line on environmental protection .
moreover , some residents of germany 's perennially cash-strapped capital have taken umbrage at the fact that obama 's visit will cost a half-million euros -lrb- $ 786,000 -rrb- - half of which will be born by german public funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one change in berlin - no signs " how come the german and the berlin taxpayer has to pony up 250,000 euros so that obama gets a nice television backdrop for his campaign ? " asked one irritated blogger on the web site of a local newspaper .
but another was quick to respond .
" what do you want , mccain to win ? " that person asked .
" it would be good if obama won , and he can only do that if he convinces voters back home via the tv .
so let the cameras show masses of people flocking to obama through the brandenburg gate . "
obama originally wanted to speak at that symbolic location , but the event was moved after concerns that the gate should n't be used for political purposes .
now the democratic candidate hopes that huge crowds of cheering supporters , mostly foreign , at victory column will help him win november 's election in the us . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm proud and honored to be involved , " said schendel of his engagement for the highest of high culture events . stunt men are a rarity in any opera house , but especially at a wagner performance where music and meaning are the focus . the annual festival at bayreuth is run by descendants of composer richard wagner and is gently experimenting this year with such 21st century ideas as live streaming to a paying online audience . surprise saved for the audience precisely what schendel has to do is still a secret : the effect is meant to be a surprise for german chancellor angela merkel and other vip guests who turn up in ball gowns and tuxedos for the opening night . schendel , who has been in the stunts profession since 1995 , recalls , " when i was a kid i wanted to be a stunt man . " i used to copy stunts by my heroes like colt seavers , " he said , referring to a fictional stunt man in a us television series , the fall guy . schendel dropped out of his studies , learned to be a camera-man so he could get a foot in the door of the film business , and joined a stunt team to develop a repertoire of stunts . he became the head of a group in 2000 and registered it as a firm , vipstuntcamf , which won contracts in germany and abroad . he has worked on movies in which stars including natalie portman , susan sarandon and john goodman have played . next role : would-be hitler assassin he is set to appear fleetingly next year in valkyrie , the movie about a true-life plot to assassinate adolf hitler , as a nazi officer blown up by the bomb . schendel 's appearance in wagner 's parsifal will last just a few moments , but is complicated enough .
every wagner festival offers a fresh staging of one of the composer 's works , with the rest of the month-long program reprising previous years ' productions from the festival repertoire .
this year parsifal is up for the honor . " fortunately i do n't have to sing , " said schendel .
he takes over ventris ' role to make his long leap down to soft mats devised by fellow german stunt man christian gneissel to cushion the impact . the player who gets back to his feet again and continues singing will be ventris , of course , not schendel , but the audience will probably not even notice the illusion . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , members of the opposition green party and the left party said the new identification card still posed grave risks and did not bring added security .
silke stokar , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the green party in parliament , urged german citizens not to voluntarily give their digital fingerprint , warning there was no knowing what would happen to the data abroad where german data privacy laws did not apply .
" the digital fingerprint should only be used for official police investigations and not in identification cards , " stokar said .
immigrants groups against citizenship test the german cabinet also formally approved a new citizenship test for would-be germans that has angered immigrant groups in the country .
those applying for a german passport will in future have to undergo a written test and answer at least 17 of 33 multiple choice questions on german history , culture and politicians correctly to pass .
the exam will cost applicants 25 euros -lrb- $ 40 -rrb- for a try and they will be given the questions beforehand to study .
critics of the test say it is too difficult and doubt whether even germans would be able to pass it .
germany has an estimated seven million permanent residents without a german passport .
germany 's 2.3-million strong turkish community has been especially critical of the test and prominent representatives for the group have lobbied the german government for the right to keep both turkish and german passports . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

people living in the countryside have been sharing their experiences of rural life .
marcus conrad , 36 , carrick , truro " i recently retrained as a teacher and will start my first job at a primary school in kerrier , cornwall in september .
i currently live with my parents in carrick , where i 'm registered on an affordable housing association scheme .
i 've been registered for four years .
it would take about an hour to get to work from where i live at the moment .
the price of fuel at the moment would mean it would cost a lot for me to drive in to work every day .
that would be expensive for me and bad for the environment .
all of the housing around here is out of my price range .
a lot of people , some from london , seem to be buying second homes which has pushed the price up .
there are fewer jobs in rural areas , whereas in a city there are about 30 schools to choose from .
in cornwall the schools are more spread out .
most people i know are multi-skilled .
they have a couple of jobs - someone might lecture and do freelance work , for example .
it 's harder to survive . "
linda bremner , aylmerton , norfolk " i work part-time in a local supermarket .
i 'm 60-years-old but have to work part-time just to pay the bills .
i work 28 hours a week .
i ca n't afford to retire completely yet .
my partner , who is the same age , works between 16 and 20 hours a week .
i still have to work , otherwise i could n't afford to live .
all the jobs in the area are minimum wage .
if you went to the nearest city , norwich , you 'd get more , but it would take time to get there as it 's about 20 miles away .
and it costs to get there - you have to drive because there are no bus services here .
you need to have a car because otherwise you would n't go anywhere .
my partner and i both need a car to get to work .
i have lived here for seven years .
i 'll probably have to work until i 'm 65 , and then maybe we will sell our house and go somewhere smaller .
it 's lovely here - it 's safe and there is a low crime rate .
but you pay for these benefits . "
cliff blaken , 70 , chepstow " my wife and i live in a three-bedroom house which i 've lived in since 1961 .
we 're finding it more and more difficult to pay the bills .
however , each month our bills are paid and we are n't going into debt .
we keep the cost down by doing little things , like closing the doors and shutting the heating down wherever possible .
i have been declared epileptic , so i 've had to give up driving which has been a blessing in disguise because we could n't have afforded the cost of fuel as it stands at the moment .
we 'd like to live in a bungalow , but we could n't afford to go anywhere .
all the bungalows around here are too expensive .
i bought my house for £ 2,000 and it has been valued at about £ 175,000 , but once you include the arrangement fees and legal costs we could n't afford to buy another place . "

the rural development sub-committee says the welsh assembly government is not doing enough to help rural poor .
it also recommends that ministers try to build more than the current target of 6,500 affordable homes by 2011 .
the assembly government said it was aware of the issues and was working to address them .
the rural deprivation in wales report , which will be launched at the royal welsh show , said fuel , travel costs and house prices were all higher in many rural areas than in urban areas , while average incomes tended to be lower .
but all too often , poverty was seen as a purely urban phenomenon , said the ams .
members said this had to change , with the assembly government doing more to deal with problems of poverty and deprivation .
for the whole community in terms of accessing jobs , public services , without transport it 's impossible alun davies am the ams want a broadening of concessionary bus fare schemes to allow older people to access cheaper travel on other modes of transport , such as trains , where adequate bus provision is not available .
the committee also wants to see cheaper transport for young people .
it also recommends that planning guidance be strengthened to enable more affordable housing to be developed in rural areas and to allow local authorities to release more land for this purpose .
' additional costs ' mid and west wales labour am alun davies , the chair of the committee , said transport was " fundamental " to the eradication of poverty in rural wales .
" for young people who want to take part in after school or pre-school activities , for young people who simply want to socialise , without access to transport they ca n't do it , " he said .
" for the whole community in terms of accessing jobs , public services , without transport it 's impossible .
" people in rural wales already suffer huge amounts of additional costs in terms of transport and housing , for example , on wages that are on average lower than those in urban wales .
" if the government is going to eradicate poverty across the face of wales they need to address issues about transport , access to better paid jobs and at the same time housing for people in rural wales . "

the north wales probation area team have been accepted as competitors at the rhs tatton park flower show - the first time offenders will take part .
they will be taking part in the national flowerbed competition at the cheshire show , which opens wednesday .
the offenders have been doing community service as part of their punishment , including doing work in parks in conwy .
they have also helped out at conwy council 's tanllan nurseries in llanelian , where the idea to enter a team at tatton was first thought of .
community service supervisor brian dunt said the team was " thrilled " about taking part in tatton .
this is a big feather in our cap and we 're looking forward to it immensely brian dunt , community service supervisor " the design is based on an anti-graffiti message - a brick wall with graffiti on it but made out of summer bedding plants , " he said .
" i have got a couple of lads who have finished their order who want to come back and help .
" it 's going to be very intense but it 's an ideal opportunity for the probation service to prove what we can do .
" this is a big feather in our cap and we 're looking forward to it immensely . "
the scheme came about due to a partnership with the council , which has an impressive track record at the flower show .
they won a silver award in 2006 and a silver gilt prize last year but this time they 're also overseeing the entry by the probation team .
3,500 bedding plants peter barton-price , the council 's assistant manager for parks and green , who oversaw both entries , said : " we saw the partnership with the probation service as a great opportunity to look at some of the tasks we were unable to look at due to manpower and also to give an opportunity to people on probation .
" the national flowerbed competition at tatton park is probably the second biggest competition held by the royal horticultural society and the other one is at chelsea flower show .
" so , it does n't get much bigger than this .
this is one of the pinnacles of the horticultural calendar - this is a big deal for us . "
the team had three days to create their flowerbed - complete with a minimum of 3,500 summer bedding plants - at the flower show .
judging took place on tuesday and the show , near knutsford , runs until sunday .

the move is part of plans by the us industrial conglomerate , which covers jet engines to healthcare and media , to seek out higher growth areas .
the companies are set to establish projects in clean energy and water as well as oil and gas .
longer term , mubadala aims to be one of ge 's major shareholders .
among the projects the two firms are set to work on is a clean energy technology centre in a new city , masdar city , that intends to be carbon neutral .
ge has been targeting growth in the middle east and last year the firm saw revenue from the region increase by 50 % on the year before to $ 5bn .
" what -lsb- this joint venture -rsb- allows us to do is get good geographic and asset spread of risk , but more importantly it allows us to reallocate to higher-return opportunities in commercial finance , " said ge 's chief executive jeff immelt .

its aim is to make discoveries about myelin and translate those discoveries into drug treatments that promote myelin repair .
it is significant that we now have a range of treatments that target one important element of multiple sclerosis - the inflammatory process .
beta interferons , glatiramer acetate and natalizumab work by dampening the inflammation that exists in the early stages of ms. treatments such as these have been brought about by great advances in our understanding of how the immune system works in ms. currently , however , there are no treatments that can help with the repair and protection of myelin to prevent or reduce nerve fibre loss in ms , and finding an effective treatment to prevent and try to reverse progressive disease is now the highest priority .
multiple sclerosis ms is a condition in which myelin wrapped around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord is lost the concentrated areas of myelin loss are called plaques - also known as lesions or scars the word " sclerosis " comes from the greek " skleros " meaning hard , with the many hard areas of scarring giving rise to the name " multiple sclerosis " in ms , the damage to myelin is caused by inflammation - active inflammatory cells from the body 's own immune system infiltrate the central nervous system -lrb- the brain and spinal cord -rrb- scientists do not yet know why these active cells get out of the blood where they belong and enter the brain , causing the loss of myelin myelin matters because it enables signals to travel along the nerve fibres .
interruption and loss of signalling can cause attacks of numbness , loss of vision , weakness , bladder problems and problems with movement - the symptoms associated with ms myelin also matters because it protects the nerve fibres themselves we want to know how to promote remyelination , and thereby develop a treatment that can help myelin repair .
that 's the next key scientific question in ms treatment .
this will take patience , but already we have some discoveries on which we can build .
at the edinburgh ms research centre , we will try to unravel the mysteries of myelin .
we know there are two main ways that myelin is damaged in ms by the inflammatory cells that infiltrate the central nervous system .
one is where the myelin is attacked , but the cells that make myelin -lrb- called oligodendrocytes -rrb- survive , and the other is where these cells themselves are attacked and destroyed .
we know that the way myelin is damaged will be different from person to person .
but in any one person , it will be the same process .
we also know that the treatments needed to promote remyelination will be different for each of these processes .
so , if the myelin-making cells are still present in the brain , we must try to reactivate them to repair .
if they are destroyed , we must either replace them by transplantation , or generate new cells from within the brain itself .
one of the most exciting discoveries of recent years is the finding that the adult brain contains stem cells throughout life .
adult stem cells so , as transplantation carries risk , it would be preferable to use the brain 's own stem cells to generate the new cells needed to make myelin .
along with the discovery of " adult " stem cells , scientists have also learned that the central nervous system has an in-built or innate ability to repair myelin itself .
under a microscope , you can see that there is some remyelination in early stage ms. the body 's own repair mechanisms are forming new myelin - seen as thinner rings than the myelin coating it replaces , but sufficient to protect the nerve fibres .
this natural remyelination can be very extensive in many people with ms. it varies from person to person .
click here to see a full table over time in ms , however , the natural repair process starts to fail .
the problem is very complicated , and although we know that particular cells are key in remyelination , we also need to look more widely at the environment in which these cells are situated to identify what helps them , and what inhibits them .
it is a very tough challenge and to meet it , we and other scientists are exploring multiple approaches to try to discover more .
to help make discoveries about myelin , other important work will take place at edinburgh .
we will try to develop better experimental models of ms so scientists can test their ideas .
studies also need to use human cells .
the edinburgh ms research centre will generate human oligodendrocytes from stem cells , and collaborate with others to examine post-mortem tissue donated by people with ms. work will also take place using sophisticated mri .
scientists have a challenge ahead to identify features that can be seen on mri that can be matched up with the different patterns of myelin damage and remyelination in ms. the vision for the edinburgh ms research centre is to make discoveries that go way beyond national boundaries it is a natural question for people living with ms now to ask how long it will take to have a treatment for myelin repair in ms. the answer is that it takes on average about 10 to 12 years to take a target to the clinic .
that is , it takes about a decade from discovering a drug target to producing a drug , and first the centre will need to identify targets - for example , a factor that promotes growth of myelin .
the edinburgh ms research centre will also be working to improve the care and treatment of people with ms now .
the centre will try to take advantage of the new therapies that drug companies are currently developing and help run the clinical trials needed to establish their effectiveness .
the centre will recruit additional neurologists to work directly with people with ms in the clinic at the western general hospital .
the centre will be a major hub of ms research into myelin repair .
other centres also have myelin repair as their aim - the ms society cambridge centre for myelin repair , and other centres internationally .
' huge difference ' we all share common goals and we all interact , with a mixture of competition and collaboration ensuring that advances come as quickly as possible - a bit like a professional bicycle race , where everyone wants to finish as fast as possible , but knows that they must work with others to stay ahead of the pack .
having said that , i believe that scotland is uniquely placed to advance and deliver in ms research .
scotland has one of the strongest set of stem cell biologists anywhere in the world , and there is a major new initiative here called the scottish centre for regenerative medicine , of which our centre is a part .
there is no other place that i am aware of in the uk that is trying to put all of its stem cell biologists and all the clinicians interested in regenerative medicine in the same building .
it is something that could make a huge difference to medicine .
it is fitting , too , that scotland has such a centre for ms research .
scotland is thought to have the highest rate of ms in the world .
the vision for the edinburgh ms research centre is to make discoveries that go way beyond national boundaries . • this piece is based on an article first published in ms matters , the ms society 's magazine for people living with ms. multiple sclerosis around the world estimates by national ms charities country number of people with ms prevalance -lrb- people with ms per 100,000 -rrb- uk 85,000 143.8 sweden 12,000 134.8 ireland 4,500 125.0 denmark 6,000 112.0 canada 35,000 111.0 iceland 285 105.1 germany 110,000 99.0 finland 5,000 98.0 czech republic 10,000 97.1 netherlands 15,000 94.9 luxembourg 400 94.1 usa 250,000 91.7 italy 50,000 88.2 belgium 8,900 87.5 norway 3,800 86.4 austria 7,000 86.4 france 50,000 84.9 new zealand 3,000 81.3 israel 4,500 80.4 poland 30,000 77.1 spain 30,000 76.7 hungary 6,600 65.0 australia 12,000 63.8 estonia 725 51.0 portugal 5,000 50.5 cyprus 350 46.7 greece 5,000 46.7 turkey 30,000 46.4 bulgaria 3,200 39.3 romania 7,500 33.4 argentina 5,000 13.6 mexico 8,000 8.1 libya 290 5.9 brazil 7,000 4.0 japan 5,000 4.0 south africa 1,500 3.5 hong kong 50 0.9 taiwan 175 0.8 zimbabwe 50 0.5 source : the multiple sclerosis information trust e-mail this to a friend printable version bookmark with : delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these ?

its aim is to make discoveries about myelin and translate those discoveries into drug treatments that promote myelin repair .
it is significant that we now have a range of treatments that target one important element of multiple sclerosis - the inflammatory process .
beta interferons , glatiramer acetate and natalizumab work by dampening the inflammation that exists in the early stages of ms. treatments such as these have been brought about by great advances in our understanding of how the immune system works in ms. currently , however , there are no treatments that can help with the repair and protection of myelin to prevent or reduce nerve fibre loss in ms , and finding an effective treatment to prevent and try to reverse progressive disease is now the highest priority .
multiple sclerosis ms is a condition in which myelin wrapped around nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord is lost the concentrated areas of myelin loss are called plaques - also known as lesions or scars the word " sclerosis " comes from the greek " skleros " meaning hard , with the many hard areas of scarring giving rise to the name " multiple sclerosis " in ms , the damage to myelin is caused by inflammation - active inflammatory cells from the body 's own immune system infiltrate the central nervous system -lrb- the brain and spinal cord -rrb- scientists do not yet know why these active cells get out of the blood where they belong and enter the brain , causing the loss of myelin myelin matters because it enables signals to travel along the nerve fibres .
interruption and loss of signalling can cause attacks of numbness , loss of vision , weakness , bladder problems and problems with movement - the symptoms associated with ms myelin also matters because it protects the nerve fibres themselves we want to know how to promote remyelination , and thereby develop a treatment that can help myelin repair .
that 's the next key scientific question in ms treatment .
this will take patience , but already we have some discoveries on which we can build .
at the edinburgh ms research centre , we will try to unravel the mysteries of myelin .
we know there are two main ways that myelin is damaged in ms by the inflammatory cells that infiltrate the central nervous system .
one is where the myelin is attacked , but the cells that make myelin -lrb- called oligodendrocytes -rrb- survive , and the other is where these cells themselves are attacked and destroyed .
we know that the way myelin is damaged will be different from person to person .
but in any one person , it will be the same process .
we also know that the treatments needed to promote remyelination will be different for each of these processes .
so , if the myelin-making cells are still present in the brain , we must try to reactivate them to repair .
if they are destroyed , we must either replace them by transplantation , or generate new cells from within the brain itself .
one of the most exciting discoveries of recent years is the finding that the adult brain contains stem cells throughout life .

interruption and loss of signalling can cause attacks of numbness , loss of vision , weakness , bladder problems and problems with movement - the symptoms associated with ms myelin also matters because it protects the nerve fibres themselves we want to know how to promote remyelination , and thereby develop a treatment that can help myelin repair .
that 's the next key scientific question in ms treatment .
this will take patience , but already we have some discoveries on which we can build .
at the edinburgh ms research centre , we will try to unravel the mysteries of myelin .
we know there are two main ways that myelin is damaged in ms by the inflammatory cells that infiltrate the central nervous system .
one is where the myelin is attacked , but the cells that make myelin -lrb- called oligodendrocytes -rrb- survive , and the other is where these cells themselves are attacked and destroyed .
we know that the way myelin is damaged will be different from person to person .
but in any one person , it will be the same process .
we also know that the treatments needed to promote remyelination will be different for each of these processes .
so , if the myelin-making cells are still present in the brain , we must try to reactivate them to repair .
if they are destroyed , we must either replace them by transplantation , or generate new cells from within the brain itself .
one of the most exciting discoveries of recent years is the finding that the adult brain contains stem cells throughout life .
adult stem cells so , as transplantation carries risk , it would be preferable to use the brain 's own stem cells to generate the new cells needed to make myelin .
along with the discovery of " adult " stem cells , scientists have also learned that the central nervous system has an in-built or innate ability to repair myelin itself .
under a microscope , you can see that there is some remyelination in early stage ms. the body 's own repair mechanisms are forming new myelin - seen as thinner rings than the myelin coating it replaces , but sufficient to protect the nerve fibres .
this natural remyelination can be very extensive in many people with ms. it varies from person to person .
click here to see a full table over time in ms , however , the natural repair process starts to fail .
the problem is very complicated , and although we know that particular cells are key in remyelination , we also need to look more widely at the environment in which these cells are situated to identify what helps them , and what inhibits them .
it is a very tough challenge and to meet it , we and other scientists are exploring multiple approaches to try to discover more .
to help make discoveries about myelin , other important work will take place at edinburgh .
we will try to develop better experimental models of ms so scientists can test their ideas .
studies also need to use human cells .
the edinburgh ms research centre will generate human oligodendrocytes from stem cells , and collaborate with others to examine post-mortem tissue donated by people with ms. work will also take place using sophisticated mri .
scientists have a challenge ahead to identify features that can be seen on mri that can be matched up with the different patterns of myelin damage and remyelination in ms. the vision for the edinburgh ms research centre is to make discoveries that go way beyond national boundaries it is a natural question for people living with ms now to ask how long it will take to have a treatment for myelin repair in ms. the answer is that it takes on average about 10 to 12 years to take a target to the clinic .
that is , it takes about a decade from discovering a drug target to producing a drug , and first the centre will need to identify targets - for example , a factor that promotes growth of myelin .
the edinburgh ms research centre will also be working to improve the care and treatment of people with ms now .
the centre will try to take advantage of the new therapies that drug companies are currently developing and help run the clinical trials needed to establish their effectiveness .
the centre will recruit additional neurologists to work directly with people with ms in the clinic at the western general hospital .
the centre will be a major hub of ms research into myelin repair .
other centres also have myelin repair as their aim - the ms society cambridge centre for myelin repair , and other centres internationally .
' huge difference ' we all share common goals and we all interact , with a mixture of competition and collaboration ensuring that advances come as quickly as possible - a bit like a professional bicycle race , where everyone wants to finish as fast as possible , but knows that they must work with others to stay ahead of the pack .
having said that , i believe that scotland is uniquely placed to advance and deliver in ms research .
scotland has one of the strongest set of stem cell biologists anywhere in the world , and there is a major new initiative here called the scottish centre for regenerative medicine , of which our centre is a part .
there is no other place that i am aware of in the uk that is trying to put all of its stem cell biologists and all the clinicians interested in regenerative medicine in the same building .
it is something that could make a huge difference to medicine .
it is fitting , too , that scotland has such a centre for ms research .
scotland is thought to have the highest rate of ms in the world .

its aim is to make discoveries about myelin and translate those discoveries into drug treatments that promote myelin repair .

in the past he has used a stick to help him walk , but he does not need one at the moment . "
it 's unusual to have married couples where both have ms. that is , it 's unusual for us because when we were married neither of us had ms or any symptoms that we knew about .
i was diagnosed in about 1996 .
all three of us had the experience of the diagnosis taking a long time .
they looked at everything else .
in karen 's case she was diagnosed with ménière 's disease , which is a balance disorder in the ears , kind of being clumsy .
we live with ms , but it 's not , it 's definitely not an important part of how we live .
i mean , a lot of people would be surprised when they see this , that we have ms. some people know and some people do n't .
we do n't disclose it to everyone .

the 37-year-old now uses a wheelchair ; her body shakes , making it impossible to hold things ; and she 's losing her sight .
orkney has the highest rate of ms on the planet - about one in every 330 people is believed to have the illness .
for catherine , the progression of ms has been fairly steady - but she remains very positive , although she does n't know what might happen next .
my first attack was in leeds when i tried to get out of bed and fell on the floor .
i went to the university doctor and then into the leeds general hospital .
i lay on the bed and thought : ' hey , this is ms. '
catherine hannah says she has just got on with life i knew 20 people with ms. coming from orkney and having been born in shetland , i knew a lot of people with it .
if you go on the street , ask anybody and they 'll say they know somebody .
when i went to see the university doctor he had tissues on his table and he said : ' they think it 's ms. '
and i was like : ' hey , tell me something i did n't know . '
i was determined to get on with life and spend time in china as part of my university course .
that was the may or june .
by september i was on the plane to go to china .
i had ms but i decided nothing was going to stop me .
i decided if i can , i will .
so i did .
i did teacher training in edinburgh .
i did a term , but it was very hard work .
you were staying up until maybe 12 o 'clock at night , preparing for the next day .
it was hard work .
too hard work .
my body just said no .
i did have an attack , but luckily i was living with an old friend who helped .
but i came home and said to mum and dad : ' i do n't think this is right . '
so i stopped the course .
i went back to orkney and for a while worked part-time in a shop until i had to stop work .
catherine in more active days if you 've got ms , everybody is different .
you may have one attack , you may have two attacks .
or you may relapse , remit or go to the stage i am now .
in a way it was a relief not to know the future .
i just got on with my life .
no-one gave me an invitation not to do things .
i just got on with it , and tried as best i could .
now i just enjoy life and get on with it .
i 'm lucky enough that my husband has given up his work to look after me .
so we can just enjoy it while we can .

the 37-year-old now uses a wheelchair ; her body shakes , making it impossible to hold things ; and she 's losing her sight .
orkney has the highest rate of ms on the planet - about one in every 330 people is believed to have the illness .
for catherine , the progression of ms has been fairly steady - but she remains very positive , although she does n't know what might happen next .
my first attack was in leeds when i tried to get out of bed and fell on the floor .
i went to the university doctor and then into the leeds general hospital .
i lay on the bed and thought : ' hey , this is ms. '
catherine hannah says she has just got on with life i knew 20 people with ms. coming from orkney and having been born in shetland , i knew a lot of people with it .
if you go on the street , ask anybody and they 'll say they know somebody .
when i went to see the university doctor he had tissues on his table and he said : ' they think it 's ms. '
and i was like : ' hey , tell me something i did n't know . '
i was determined to get on with life and spend time in china as part of my university course .
that was the may or june .
by september i was on the plane to go to china .
i had ms but i decided nothing was going to stop me .
i decided if i can , i will .
so i did .
i did teacher training in edinburgh .
i did a term , but it was very hard work .
you were staying up until maybe 12 o 'clock at night , preparing for the next day .
it was hard work .
too hard work .
my body just said no .
i did have an attack , but luckily i was living with an old friend who helped .
but i came home and said to mum and dad : ' i do n't think this is right . '
so i stopped the course .
i went back to orkney and for a while worked part-time in a shop until i had to stop work .
catherine in more active days if you 've got ms , everybody is different .
you may have one attack , you may have two attacks .
or you may relapse , remit or go to the stage i am now .
in a way it was a relief not to know the future .
i just got on with my life .
no-one gave me an invitation not to do things .
i just got on with it , and tried as best i could .
now i just enjoy life and get on with it .
i 'm lucky enough that my husband has given up his work to look after me .
so we can just enjoy it while we can .

however , she believes she might have had symptoms since the 1960s .
ms mcdougall 's cousin dan o 'brien also has the condition .
her ancestors were the mcdougalls , who hailed from tobermory . "
in 1994 i started to have numbness in my legs .
i 'd walk and feel like i was going to fall , and that type of thing .
so i went to talk to my doctor and they found a brain tumour , which was removed .
but the numbness in my legs came back and then the fatigue started and i never recovered from that .
it was a relief to be diagnosed with ms because then i knew there was something i could do to address the illness - because i knew there was something wrong .
the idea of a scottish link to this disease is interesting .
my father is 90 and when i spoke with him about meeting for this programme , -lsb- elizabeth quigley 's documentary scotland 's hidden epidemic : the truth about ms -rsb- he does n't recall any history of ms on either side of my family , but who knows ? "

the financial throes of the country are now so severe , that some people are seeking a new language to understand it .
on monday , the zimbabwe government introduced the 100 billion zimbabwe dollar note -lrb- for the uninitiated , a billion has nine zeros -rrb- .
the counting of zeros had already become a nightmare for bankers and shoppers before the introduction of the new note - which at the time of writing would buy about two loaves of bread .
so far this year , the country ravaged by hyperinflation has been forced to print 100-million , 250-million and 500-million notes in rapid succession .
all of them are now almost worthless .
it has become common now for zimbabweans to talk of their daily expenses in trillions -lrb- one trillion has 12 zeros -rrb- .
when john robertson pinned a chart to the wall of office naming numbers up to twice as long , he says he " raised a bit of a laugh " from his colleagues .
but for many officials and accountants , a quadrillion - a million billion - is the number of the day .
big numbers quadrillion : 15 zeros quintillion : 18 zeros sextillion : 21 zeros septillion 24 zeros this formulation is from the widely-used us system only last week , the harare herald advertised the lotto bonanza prize being offered was 1.2 quadrillion zimbabwean dollars .
at the time , that was equivalent to around 4,000 us dollars .
so how do zimbabweans deal with such astronomical numbers ?
" i actually googled what comes after trillion about a month ago , and sent that out to all my friends so they 'd be prepared , " says 28-year-old esther , a harare resident who writes a regular diary for the bbc .
day-to-day transactions for ordinary people have not reached the quadrillion stage , she says , but even trillions present difficulties .
" what is confusing is counting of the figures on your cheques as you try to make sure you are not under or over paying someone , or the struggling to read price tags in shops that have not yet knocked off zeros and so on , " she says .
hard currency this practice - knocking off zeros - is the most common way of preserving sanity .
most calculators simply can not show enough digits .
tills throughout the country have been struggling to cope , as have banking computers , and accounting systems .
as a result , the banks recently agreed to lop six zeros off transactions and documentation .
economist john robertson predicts that within a month they will be forced to drop another three .
the other main technique for keeping zeros under control , is to think in terms of a hard currency - in this case , us dollars .
it would be against the law to advertise your house in us dollars , mr robertson says , but in practice this is the currency used for big purchases .
" nothing would be written down and on the day of exchange , that figure would either be paid in us dollars , or converted into zimbabwe dollars .
then you would be talking big numbers - which will take a bit of getting used to . "
while zimbabwe is the only country currently suffering from hyperinflation its economic woes are not unprecedented .
bundles of cash history has shown that in countries experiencing hyperinflation - characterised by a monthly inflation of more than 50 % - the central bank often prints money in larger and larger denominations as the smaller denomination notes become worthless . "
beyond a million it all becomes a blur " marcus du sautoy , maths professor in yugoslavia , for example , the rate of inflation was five quadrillion per cent between october 1993 and january 1994 .
the government was forced to issue a 500 billion dinar note in 1993 .
in germany after world war i , prices were doubling about every two days and workers were paid daily or more often with bundles of cash .
the highest value banknote issued by the reichsbank had a face value of 100 trillion marks .
marcus du sautoy , professor of mathematics at the university of oxford , says in general people are very bad at assessing numbers of this size .
" beyond a million it all becomes a blur , " he says .
" people are really looking for the ratio of one product to another , and then it 's irrelevant how many zeros there are at the end of the number , " he says .
if shops and banks do n't drop the zeros , it 's done instead by the human brain .

few details of his arrest have emerged , though serbian minister rasim ljajic said he was intercepted near belgrade " while changing locations " .
serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic went on to describe how mr karadzic had " walked around freely , even appeared in public places " , disguised as the alternative medical practitioner dragan dabic .
the account astonished many experts , who had assumed mr karadzic must have been living in secrecy , surrounded by close allies , not interacting with the public in serbia 's capital .
radovan karadzic was drinking coffee at a remote restaurant on the foca to gacko road in southern bosnia how karadzic was protected tales have emerged in recent years of snatched sightings of the fugitive , who would appear relaxed while quaffing a coffee , then would disappear without trace .
the serbian government regularly claimed mr karadzic was not in serbia , while nato troops launched several attempts to corner him but were left clutching thin air .
accused of genocide , mr karadzic - along with his military commander ratko mladic , who remains at large - had been at the top of the international war crimes tribunal 's most wanted list since the transfer of former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic in 2001 .
mafia protection the bbc 's balkans correspondent , nick thorpe , recently wrote about a journalist trying to follow the trail of mr karadzic who was warned by dutch intelligence services : " do n't write about it , if you value your life . "
the former bosnian serb leader was protected by a mafia ring so powerful that dutch agents on the case needed protection on their return to the netherlands , he was told .
a former bosnian secret agent said two cia men were found dead after closing in on the war crimes suspect .
the hunt for radovan karadzic reportedly seen in foca , visegrad and along bosnia / montenegro border around time of first reported failed arrest attempt celebici - scene of second reported attempt by nato to capture him in spring 2002 unsubstantiated claims suggested he might be hiding in monasteries in trebinje , ostrog and frusca gora pale his family home was kept under surveillance serb officials said his most recently living in new belgrade met staff from healthy living magazine based in belgrade 's tadeusa koscuska street reported to have given health-related lectures in sombor , kikinda , novi sad and smederevo in april 2004 , nato-led forces carried out a raid on church buildings in mr karadzic 's former wartime headquarters in the bosnian serb stronghold of pale , which they believed mr karadzic was visiting .
he was not there - but a priest and his son were seriously injured in the raid , prompting an avalanche of criticism in the serbian press .
nato troops raided the houses of mr karadzic 's children sonja and sasha on 20 february 2007 - again without any result .
many analysts questioned whether the west really had the political will to risk agents ' lives going after mr karadzic , despite him being one of the most wanted men in the world .
carl bildt , the former un envoy to bosnia after the war , told the bbc that members of the alliance had shied away from any action that might have threatened the fragile peace .
" i think there was a sort of collective reluctance by the nato military commanders - and they were n't -lsb- just -rsb- american command , but british command as well , " he said .
" the reason was they feared that if they moved against him , or against ratko mladic , there was going to be significant political disturbances of some sort or another . "
until recently , it was thought the serbian government shared the reluctance to seize mr karadzic - though a change of administration seems to have brought a new attitude .
mladic 's ' military backing ' mr ljajic , the serbian minister , said some details about mr karadzic 's capture were being withheld , as the authorities were planning to use " operational data " to track the two main war crimes suspects still at large , gen ratko mladic and former croatian serb political leader goran hadzic .
gen mladic , who led bosnian serb forces during the srebrenica massacre , is the prime target .
in 2004 , documents leaked by western diplomats suggested he was still enjoying the protection of the bosnian serb military .
he was said to be regularly visiting areas in bosnia to celebrate birthdays with his wartime colleagues and go hunting in remote forests .
in an unprecedented move , eu peacekeepers in bosnia opened up a secret bosnian serb underground military complex near the town of han pijesak .
journalists were invited to the bunker where , it was claimed , gen mladic had been as recently as july 2004 .
a nato-led operation at the time failed to find its man .
it was also revealed that gen mladic had still been an official member of the bosnian serb military as recently as 2002 and was still receiving a military pension .
heat stepped up but although gen mladic is originally from bosnia , there have been strong rumours that his real support has come from elements within the military and intelligence services in neighbouring serbia .
leading serb politicians have admitted for some time that democratic control over every part of the serbian security structures has been more wishful thinking than reality .
serb politicians have always denied gen mladic was on their patch .
the truth was that , most of the time , they did not know whether he was or not , correspondents say .
in january 2006 the eu warned serbia that its failure to hand over gen mladic could jeopardise talks paving the way for eventual eu membership .
it seems that with a new government in belgrade , and a new head of serbian intelligence , the heat on gen mladic is about to be stepped up .

few details of his arrest have emerged , though serbian minister rasim ljajic said he was intercepted near belgrade " while changing locations " .
serbia 's war crimes prosecutor vladimir vukcevic went on to describe how mr karadzic had " walked around freely , even appeared in public places " , disguised as the alternative medical practitioner dragan dabic .
the account astonished many experts , who had assumed mr karadzic must have been living in secrecy , surrounded by close allies , not interacting with the public in serbia 's capital .
radovan karadzic was drinking coffee at a remote restaurant on the foca to gacko road in southern bosnia how karadzic was protected tales have emerged in recent years of snatched sightings of the fugitive , who would appear relaxed while quaffing a coffee , then would disappear without trace .
the serbian government regularly claimed mr karadzic was not in serbia , while nato troops launched several attempts to corner him but were left clutching thin air .
accused of genocide , mr karadzic - along with his military commander ratko mladic , who remains at large - had been at the top of the international war crimes tribunal 's most wanted list since the transfer of former yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic in 2001 .
mafia protection the bbc 's balkans correspondent , nick thorpe , recently wrote about a journalist trying to follow the trail of mr karadzic who was warned by dutch intelligence services : " do n't write about it , if you value your life . "
the former bosnian serb leader was protected by a mafia ring so powerful that dutch agents on the case needed protection on their return to the netherlands , he was told .
a former bosnian secret agent said two cia men were found dead after closing in on the war crimes suspect .
the hunt for radovan karadzic reportedly seen in foca , visegrad and along bosnia / montenegro border around time of first reported failed arrest attempt celebici - scene of second reported attempt by nato to capture him in spring 2002 unsubstantiated claims suggested he might be hiding in monasteries in trebinje , ostrog and frusca gora pale his family home was kept under surveillance serb officials said his most recently living in new belgrade met staff from healthy living magazine based in belgrade 's tadeusa koscuska street reported to have given health-related lectures in sombor , kikinda , novi sad and smederevo in april 2004 , nato-led forces carried out a raid on church buildings in mr karadzic 's former wartime headquarters in the bosnian serb stronghold of pale , which they believed mr karadzic was visiting .
he was not there - but a priest and his son were seriously injured in the raid , prompting an avalanche of criticism in the serbian press .
nato troops raided the houses of mr karadzic 's children sonja and sasha on 20 february 2007 - again without any result .
many analysts questioned whether the west really had the political will to risk agents ' lives going after mr karadzic , despite him being one of the most wanted men in the world .
carl bildt , the former un envoy to bosnia after the war , told the bbc that members of the alliance had shied away from any action that might have threatened the fragile peace .
" i think there was a sort of collective reluctance by the nato military commanders - and they were n't -lsb- just -rsb- american command , but british command as well , " he said .
" the reason was they feared that if they moved against him , or against ratko mladic , there was going to be significant political disturbances of some sort or another . "
until recently , it was thought the serbian government shared the reluctance to seize mr karadzic - though a change of administration seems to have brought a new attitude .
mladic 's ' military backing ' mr ljajic , the serbian minister , said some details about mr karadzic 's capture were being withheld , as the authorities were planning to use " operational data " to track the two main war crimes suspects still at large , gen ratko mladic and former croatian serb political leader goran hadzic .
gen mladic , who led bosnian serb forces during the srebrenica massacre , is the prime target .
in 2004 , documents leaked by western diplomats suggested he was still enjoying the protection of the bosnian serb military .
he was said to be regularly visiting areas in bosnia to celebrate birthdays with his wartime colleagues and go hunting in remote forests .
in an unprecedented move , eu peacekeepers in bosnia opened up a secret bosnian serb underground military complex near the town of han pijesak .
journalists were invited to the bunker where , it was claimed , gen mladic had been as recently as july 2004 .
a nato-led operation at the time failed to find its man .
it was also revealed that gen mladic had still been an official member of the bosnian serb military as recently as 2002 and was still receiving a military pension .
heat stepped up but although gen mladic is originally from bosnia , there have been strong rumours that his real support has come from elements within the military and intelligence services in neighbouring serbia .
leading serb politicians have admitted for some time that democratic control over every part of the serbian security structures has been more wishful thinking than reality .
serb politicians have always denied gen mladic was on their patch .
the truth was that , most of the time , they did not know whether he was or not , correspondents say .
in january 2006 the eu warned serbia that its failure to hand over gen mladic could jeopardise talks paving the way for eventual eu membership .
it seems that with a new government in belgrade , and a new head of serbian intelligence , the heat on gen mladic is about to be stepped up .
