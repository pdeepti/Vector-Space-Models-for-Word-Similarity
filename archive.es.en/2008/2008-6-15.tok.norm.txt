"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .
it has earned him respect .
he once gave his players the book the art of war from sun tzu , a 2,500-year-old text on military strategy .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .
i hope to be in south africa -lsb- for the 2010 world cup -rsb- .
i and -lsb- luca -rsb- toni together would not be bad at all , " he told italian media last week .
former colonies are target rich envirnonments if brazil is the country of choice for national teams , africa seems to be the continent of choice .
it is not only the french , who have traditionally made use of their former colonies to boost their national teams , but also several other countries that have african players in their squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is famous for having stars from former colonies les bleus are playing with patrice evra -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- , steve mandanda -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- , jean-alain boumsong -lrb- born in cameroon -rrb- , patrick vieira -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- and claude makelele -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- in their squad .
swiss defender johan djourou was born in the ivory coast capital abidjan , and his teammate , gelson fernandes , comes from cape verde .
eastern europeans the newest soccer tourists several of players from eastern europe have found a new soccer home elsewhere , like austrians ivica vastic -lrb- born in split -rrb- and gyorgy garics -lrb- born in hungary -rrb- or eldin jakupovic -lrb- born in bosnia-herzegovina , yugoslavia -rrb- , who now plays for switzerland .
there are also several eastern european players who have opted to play for the country of their origin , rather than birth .
many of them are the children of parents who settled in western europe in pursuit of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's robert kovac and brother niko were born in germany ivan rakitic -lrb- born in switzerland , plays for croatia -rrb- , as well as german-born croatian players niko and robert kovac and ivan klasnic are examples .
this is a trend that probably has fifa president joseph blatter worried .
although a seasoned " man of the world " himself , he is the driving force behind fifa 's attempts to introduce the controversial 6 + 5 rule .
this states that each soccer club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club .
without it , blatter is worried that the world cup will lose some of it appeal - and with it its marketability - if national teams continue losing their national identity . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 15.06.2008 research keeps germany at solar sector zenith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's a world leader when it comes to solar energy despite its frequently cloudy skies and long , dark winters , germany has long been the leading light when it comes to tapping the sun 's power .
despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .

the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .
it has earned him respect .
he once gave his players the book the art of war from sun tzu , a 2,500-year-old text on military strategy .

the younger coaches prefer club football , with its daily challenges and often greater financial reward .

spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .

the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .

despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .

even so , sino-german relations seem to have finally recovered from the dalai lama 's visit to berlin last year . an open dialog between the state and civil society included the willingness and ability to criticize , steinmeier said at the opening of an urban development conference in the megacity of chongqing on sunday , june 15 . common responsibility worked best when the two parties were open towards each other and other countries .
" openness creates trust , " he said , adding that politics should not only limit criticism .
steinmeier told the conference in chongqing that globalization requires new policies .
" not just between centers of power in a multipolar world , but also between the state and civil society , " he added . the conference considered the challenges of growing urbanization in china .
it was part of a series of events under the theme " germany and china - together in motion " that has been ongoing since autumn 2007 . shocked by quake effects steinmeier had visited the earthquake affected area in the country 's south-west on sunday . " the situation is dramatic , " a visibly shaken steinmeier said at a camp in the area .
it was not possible to imagine from a distance what shock the country had gone through in the wake of the earthquake , the german minister said . the may 12 quake caused more than 70,000 deaths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister got a close look at the situation on the ground steinmeier visited the cities of chengdu and dujiangyan in the earthquake-hit region to discuss the work of german aid organizations .
he said he was pleased that german relief for the victims had arrived so quickly . germany plans to assist in the reconstruction of eight schools . the german red cross has already set up a field hospital funded by the german foreign ministry to the tune of more than 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- . " a true friend " steinmeier said he welcomed developments in sino-german relations , adding that a " complete normalization " had come about . his three-day visit to china , which began friday , came in the wake of a period of frosty ties between berlin and beijing after chancellor angela merkel received the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , in september 2007 . after meeting steinmeier in beijing on friday , chinese foreign minister yang jiechi announced that the two countries aimed to resume their dialog on human rights issues . yang said the dialog would resume in the second half of this year . in a further indication of an improvement in the bilateral situation , chinese premier wen jiabao thanked germany for its earthquake relief aid , which amounted to some 20 million euros , and called germany " a true friend in need .

san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .
i hope to be in south africa -lsb- for the 2010 world cup -rsb- .
i and -lsb- luca -rsb- toni together would not be bad at all , " he told italian media last week .
former colonies are target rich envirnonments if brazil is the country of choice for national teams , africa seems to be the continent of choice .
it is not only the french , who have traditionally made use of their former colonies to boost their national teams , but also several other countries that have african players in their squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is famous for having stars from former colonies les bleus are playing with patrice evra -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- , steve mandanda -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- , jean-alain boumsong -lrb- born in cameroon -rrb- , patrick vieira -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- and claude makelele -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- in their squad .
swiss defender johan djourou was born in the ivory coast capital abidjan , and his teammate , gelson fernandes , comes from cape verde .
eastern europeans the newest soccer tourists several of players from eastern europe have found a new soccer home elsewhere , like austrians ivica vastic -lrb- born in split -rrb- and gyorgy garics -lrb- born in hungary -rrb- or eldin jakupovic -lrb- born in bosnia-herzegovina , yugoslavia -rrb- , who now plays for switzerland .
there are also several eastern european players who have opted to play for the country of their origin , rather than birth .
many of them are the children of parents who settled in western europe in pursuit of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's robert kovac and brother niko were born in germany ivan rakitic -lrb- born in switzerland , plays for croatia -rrb- , as well as german-born croatian players niko and robert kovac and ivan klasnic are examples .
this is a trend that probably has fifa president joseph blatter worried .
although a seasoned " man of the world " himself , he is the driving force behind fifa 's attempts to introduce the controversial 6 + 5 rule .
this states that each soccer club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club .
without it , blatter is worried that the world cup will lose some of it appeal - and with it its marketability - if national teams continue losing their national identity . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .
it has earned him respect .
he once gave his players the book the art of war from sun tzu , a 2,500-year-old text on military strategy .
it 's not the sort of idea that a younger trainer would probably come up with .
international soccer a more leisurely atmosphere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobi kuhn is to step down after euro 2008 older coaches are also attracted to national team appointments , away from the arduous day-to-day business of league football and with more time to focus on conceptual planning .
it is one of the reasons ottmar hitzfeld at 59 has decided to take on the switzerland job after the tournament , succeeding kobi kuhn , five years his senior .
the younger coaches prefer club football , with its daily challenges and often greater financial reward .
croatia 's bilic flirted at the beginning of the year with the sv hamburg coaching job but decided to stay on as national team boss , but marco van basten is stepping down as dutch national team coach to take charge at ajax amsterdam .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .
i hope to be in south africa -lsb- for the 2010 world cup -rsb- .
i and -lsb- luca -rsb- toni together would not be bad at all , " he told italian media last week .
former colonies are target rich envirnonments if brazil is the country of choice for national teams , africa seems to be the continent of choice .
it is not only the french , who have traditionally made use of their former colonies to boost their national teams , but also several other countries that have african players in their squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is famous for having stars from former colonies les bleus are playing with patrice evra -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- , steve mandanda -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- , jean-alain boumsong -lrb- born in cameroon -rrb- , patrick vieira -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- and claude makelele -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- in their squad .
swiss defender johan djourou was born in the ivory coast capital abidjan , and his teammate , gelson fernandes , comes from cape verde .
eastern europeans the newest soccer tourists several of players from eastern europe have found a new soccer home elsewhere , like austrians ivica vastic -lrb- born in split -rrb- and gyorgy garics -lrb- born in hungary -rrb- or eldin jakupovic -lrb- born in bosnia-herzegovina , yugoslavia -rrb- , who now plays for switzerland .
there are also several eastern european players who have opted to play for the country of their origin , rather than birth .
many of them are the children of parents who settled in western europe in pursuit of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's robert kovac and brother niko were born in germany ivan rakitic -lrb- born in switzerland , plays for croatia -rrb- , as well as german-born croatian players niko and robert kovac and ivan klasnic are examples .
this is a trend that probably has fifa president joseph blatter worried .
although a seasoned " man of the world " himself , he is the driving force behind fifa 's attempts to introduce the controversial 6 + 5 rule .
this states that each soccer club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club .
without it , blatter is worried that the world cup will lose some of it appeal - and with it its marketability - if national teams continue losing their national identity . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 15.06.2008 research keeps germany at solar sector zenith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's a world leader when it comes to solar energy despite its frequently cloudy skies and long , dark winters , germany has long been the leading light when it comes to tapping the sun 's power .
despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .

" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .

shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .
missed chances on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece did what they could but it was n't enough russia , however , dominated the early play and could have gone ahead in the 15th minute when roman pavlyuchenko attempted to beat nikopolidis with a lob , but the keeper did well to palm it over the bar .
shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .
group d-day on wednesday sweden and russia face each other in their final group game on wednesday , with russia needing a win to finish second in the group , while sweden will go through with a draw .
russian forward ivan saenko said the game against sweden would be very tough .
" however , with the attitude that we showed today , we should be able to beat sweden to go through . "

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "

germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .

without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "

11 attacks in 2001 , invoking the nato mutual defense clause for the first time in the alliance 's history .
but bush had opted for an " alliance of the willing " instead of nato , which genscher described as " the alliance of the reliable and capable . "
genscher , foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 and a member of the free-market and liberal free democrats , noted that bush 's ratings were also at an historic low in the us itself .
the presidential candidacy of barack obama should be seen in this context , he said , describing his success as a " kind of cultural revolution . "
" this is an answer to the policies of bush and it is evident that this incredibly vital american democracy is recovering its powers and making the attempt to return to its great ideals , " genscher said .
iraq invasion marks trans-atlantic nadir us-german relations plummeted to a post-war low when gerhard schroeder , chancellor at the time of the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , based his successful campaign for re-election on opposition to the iraq war .
genscher was foreign minister under chancellors willy brandt , helmut schmidt and helmut kohl , holding office through major changes , such as brandt 's " ostpolitik " - opening up to the communist east - and german reunification under kohl . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .
no campaigners looking further afield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declan ganley is planning to spread the word in mainland europe meanwhile , an irish businessman who runs the lobby group libertas , which was part of the rather motley irish " no " camp , is now considering taking the anti-lisbon message to the mainland .
without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

" openness creates trust , " he said , adding that politics should not only limit criticism .
steinmeier told the conference in chongqing that globalization requires new policies .
" not just between centers of power in a multipolar world , but also between the state and civil society , " he added . the conference considered the challenges of growing urbanization in china .

" a true friend " steinmeier said he welcomed developments in sino-german relations , adding that a " complete normalization " had come about . his three-day visit to china , which began friday , came in the wake of a period of frosty ties between berlin and beijing after chancellor angela merkel received the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , in september 2007 . after meeting steinmeier in beijing on friday , chinese foreign minister yang jiechi announced that the two countries aimed to resume their dialog on human rights issues . yang said the dialog would resume in the second half of this year . in a further indication of an improvement in the bilateral situation , chinese premier wen jiabao thanked germany for its earthquake relief aid , which amounted to some 20 million euros , and called germany " a true friend in need .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "

germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .

" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "

despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .

the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .
it has earned him respect .
he once gave his players the book the art of war from sun tzu , a 2,500-year-old text on military strategy .
it 's not the sort of idea that a younger trainer would probably come up with .
international soccer a more leisurely atmosphere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobi kuhn is to step down after euro 2008 older coaches are also attracted to national team appointments , away from the arduous day-to-day business of league football and with more time to focus on conceptual planning .
it is one of the reasons ottmar hitzfeld at 59 has decided to take on the switzerland job after the tournament , succeeding kobi kuhn , five years his senior .
the younger coaches prefer club football , with its daily challenges and often greater financial reward .
croatia 's bilic flirted at the beginning of the year with the sv hamburg coaching job but decided to stay on as national team boss , but marco van basten is stepping down as dutch national team coach to take charge at ajax amsterdam .
his successor is bert van marwijk , 13 years his senior . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .
missed chances on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece did what they could but it was n't enough russia , however , dominated the early play and could have gone ahead in the 15th minute when roman pavlyuchenko attempted to beat nikopolidis with a lob , but the keeper did well to palm it over the bar .
shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .
group d-day on wednesday sweden and russia face each other in their final group game on wednesday , with russia needing a win to finish second in the group , while sweden will go through with a draw .
russian forward ivan saenko said the game against sweden would be very tough .
" however , with the attitude that we showed today , we should be able to beat sweden to go through . "
after going through the motions against greece on wednesday , spain , will face either france , italy or romania in the quarter finals , while sweden or russia will take on tournament favourites netherlands . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a stinging message for the us president , who visited germany on friday and is currently in britain .
" something has happened that the europeans , as good friends of the us , have deeply regretted : a large loss of influence and respect for the us , " genscher told regional public radio swr last week .
" we immensely regret this .
and the president has done everything to widen the distance between the us and europe , " the veteran foreign minister said .
genscher : obama is a cultural revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher served as foreign minister for 18 years he recalled how european countries had pledged their support to the us following the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , invoking the nato mutual defense clause for the first time in the alliance 's history .
but bush had opted for an " alliance of the willing " instead of nato , which genscher described as " the alliance of the reliable and capable . "
genscher , foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 and a member of the free-market and liberal free democrats , noted that bush 's ratings were also at an historic low in the us itself .
the presidential candidacy of barack obama should be seen in this context , he said , describing his success as a " kind of cultural revolution . "
" this is an answer to the policies of bush and it is evident that this incredibly vital american democracy is recovering its powers and making the attempt to return to its great ideals , " genscher said .

despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .

" serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .
no campaigners looking further afield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declan ganley is planning to spread the word in mainland europe meanwhile , an irish businessman who runs the lobby group libertas , which was part of the rather motley irish " no " camp , is now considering taking the anti-lisbon message to the mainland .
without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "
he also called upon ireland to come to next weekend 's summit with some suggestions about how to resolve the situation . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .

and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .

and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .
missed chances on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece did what they could but it was n't enough russia , however , dominated the early play and could have gone ahead in the 15th minute when roman pavlyuchenko attempted to beat nikopolidis with a lob , but the keeper did well to palm it over the bar .
shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .
group d-day on wednesday sweden and russia face each other in their final group game on wednesday , with russia needing a win to finish second in the group , while sweden will go through with a draw .
russian forward ivan saenko said the game against sweden would be very tough .
" however , with the attitude that we showed today , we should be able to beat sweden to go through . "
after going through the motions against greece on wednesday , spain , will face either france , italy or romania in the quarter finals , while sweden or russia will take on tournament favourites netherlands . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .

steinmeier told the conference in chongqing that globalization requires new policies .
" not just between centers of power in a multipolar world , but also between the state and civil society , " he added . the conference considered the challenges of growing urbanization in china .
it was part of a series of events under the theme " germany and china - together in motion " that has been ongoing since autumn 2007 . shocked by quake effects steinmeier had visited the earthquake affected area in the country 's south-west on sunday . " the situation is dramatic , " a visibly shaken steinmeier said at a camp in the area .
it was not possible to imagine from a distance what shock the country had gone through in the wake of the earthquake , the german minister said . the may 12 quake caused more than 70,000 deaths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister got a close look at the situation on the ground steinmeier visited the cities of chengdu and dujiangyan in the earthquake-hit region to discuss the work of german aid organizations .
he said he was pleased that german relief for the victims had arrived so quickly . germany plans to assist in the reconstruction of eight schools . the german red cross has already set up a field hospital funded by the german foreign ministry to the tune of more than 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- . " a true friend " steinmeier said he welcomed developments in sino-german relations , adding that a " complete normalization " had come about . his three-day visit to china , which began friday , came in the wake of a period of frosty ties between berlin and beijing after chancellor angela merkel received the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , in september 2007 . after meeting steinmeier in beijing on friday , chinese foreign minister yang jiechi announced that the two countries aimed to resume their dialog on human rights issues . yang said the dialog would resume in the second half of this year . in a further indication of an improvement in the bilateral situation , chinese premier wen jiabao thanked germany for its earthquake relief aid , which amounted to some 20 million euros , and called germany " a true friend in need .

it 's a stinging message for the us president , who visited germany on friday and is currently in britain .
" something has happened that the europeans , as good friends of the us , have deeply regretted : a large loss of influence and respect for the us , " genscher told regional public radio swr last week .
" we immensely regret this .
and the president has done everything to widen the distance between the us and europe , " the veteran foreign minister said .
genscher : obama is a cultural revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher served as foreign minister for 18 years he recalled how european countries had pledged their support to the us following the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , invoking the nato mutual defense clause for the first time in the alliance 's history .
but bush had opted for an " alliance of the willing " instead of nato , which genscher described as " the alliance of the reliable and capable . "
genscher , foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 and a member of the free-market and liberal free democrats , noted that bush 's ratings were also at an historic low in the us itself .
the presidential candidacy of barack obama should be seen in this context , he said , describing his success as a " kind of cultural revolution . "
" this is an answer to the policies of bush and it is evident that this incredibly vital american democracy is recovering its powers and making the attempt to return to its great ideals , " genscher said .
iraq invasion marks trans-atlantic nadir us-german relations plummeted to a post-war low when gerhard schroeder , chancellor at the time of the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , based his successful campaign for re-election on opposition to the iraq war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 15.06.2008 research keeps germany at solar sector zenith großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's a world leader when it comes to solar energy despite its frequently cloudy skies and long , dark winters , germany has long been the leading light when it comes to tapping the sun 's power .
despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .
i hope to be in south africa -lsb- for the 2010 world cup -rsb- .
i and -lsb- luca -rsb- toni together would not be bad at all , " he told italian media last week .
former colonies are target rich envirnonments if brazil is the country of choice for national teams , africa seems to be the continent of choice .
it is not only the french , who have traditionally made use of their former colonies to boost their national teams , but also several other countries that have african players in their squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is famous for having stars from former colonies les bleus are playing with patrice evra -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- , steve mandanda -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- , jean-alain boumsong -lrb- born in cameroon -rrb- , patrick vieira -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- and claude makelele -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- in their squad .
swiss defender johan djourou was born in the ivory coast capital abidjan , and his teammate , gelson fernandes , comes from cape verde .
eastern europeans the newest soccer tourists several of players from eastern europe have found a new soccer home elsewhere , like austrians ivica vastic -lrb- born in split -rrb- and gyorgy garics -lrb- born in hungary -rrb- or eldin jakupovic -lrb- born in bosnia-herzegovina , yugoslavia -rrb- , who now plays for switzerland .
there are also several eastern european players who have opted to play for the country of their origin , rather than birth .
many of them are the children of parents who settled in western europe in pursuit of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's robert kovac and brother niko were born in germany ivan rakitic -lrb- born in switzerland , plays for croatia -rrb- , as well as german-born croatian players niko and robert kovac and ivan klasnic are examples .
this is a trend that probably has fifa president joseph blatter worried .
although a seasoned " man of the world " himself , he is the driving force behind fifa 's attempts to introduce the controversial 6 + 5 rule .
this states that each soccer club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club .
without it , blatter is worried that the world cup will lose some of it appeal - and with it its marketability - if national teams continue losing their national identity . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .

beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .

" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .

even so , sino-german relations seem to have finally recovered from the dalai lama 's visit to berlin last year . an open dialog between the state and civil society included the willingness and ability to criticize , steinmeier said at the opening of an urban development conference in the megacity of chongqing on sunday , june 15 . common responsibility worked best when the two parties were open towards each other and other countries .
" openness creates trust , " he said , adding that politics should not only limit criticism .
steinmeier told the conference in chongqing that globalization requires new policies .
" not just between centers of power in a multipolar world , but also between the state and civil society , " he added . the conference considered the challenges of growing urbanization in china .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .
i hope to be in south africa -lsb- for the 2010 world cup -rsb- .
i and -lsb- luca -rsb- toni together would not be bad at all , " he told italian media last week .
former colonies are target rich envirnonments if brazil is the country of choice for national teams , africa seems to be the continent of choice .
it is not only the french , who have traditionally made use of their former colonies to boost their national teams , but also several other countries that have african players in their squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is famous for having stars from former colonies les bleus are playing with patrice evra -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- , steve mandanda -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- , jean-alain boumsong -lrb- born in cameroon -rrb- , patrick vieira -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- and claude makelele -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- in their squad .
swiss defender johan djourou was born in the ivory coast capital abidjan , and his teammate , gelson fernandes , comes from cape verde .
eastern europeans the newest soccer tourists several of players from eastern europe have found a new soccer home elsewhere , like austrians ivica vastic -lrb- born in split -rrb- and gyorgy garics -lrb- born in hungary -rrb- or eldin jakupovic -lrb- born in bosnia-herzegovina , yugoslavia -rrb- , who now plays for switzerland .
there are also several eastern european players who have opted to play for the country of their origin , rather than birth .
many of them are the children of parents who settled in western europe in pursuit of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's robert kovac and brother niko were born in germany ivan rakitic -lrb- born in switzerland , plays for croatia -rrb- , as well as german-born croatian players niko and robert kovac and ivan klasnic are examples .
this is a trend that probably has fifa president joseph blatter worried .
although a seasoned " man of the world " himself , he is the driving force behind fifa 's attempts to introduce the controversial 6 + 5 rule .
this states that each soccer club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club .
without it , blatter is worried that the world cup will lose some of it appeal - and with it its marketability - if national teams continue losing their national identity . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .
it has earned him respect .

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .
i hope to be in south africa -lsb- for the 2010 world cup -rsb- .
i and -lsb- luca -rsb- toni together would not be bad at all , " he told italian media last week .
former colonies are target rich envirnonments if brazil is the country of choice for national teams , africa seems to be the continent of choice .
it is not only the french , who have traditionally made use of their former colonies to boost their national teams , but also several other countries that have african players in their squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is famous for having stars from former colonies les bleus are playing with patrice evra -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- , steve mandanda -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- , jean-alain boumsong -lrb- born in cameroon -rrb- , patrick vieira -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- and claude makelele -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- in their squad .
swiss defender johan djourou was born in the ivory coast capital abidjan , and his teammate , gelson fernandes , comes from cape verde .
eastern europeans the newest soccer tourists several of players from eastern europe have found a new soccer home elsewhere , like austrians ivica vastic -lrb- born in split -rrb- and gyorgy garics -lrb- born in hungary -rrb- or eldin jakupovic -lrb- born in bosnia-herzegovina , yugoslavia -rrb- , who now plays for switzerland .
there are also several eastern european players who have opted to play for the country of their origin , rather than birth .
many of them are the children of parents who settled in western europe in pursuit of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's robert kovac and brother niko were born in germany ivan rakitic -lrb- born in switzerland , plays for croatia -rrb- , as well as german-born croatian players niko and robert kovac and ivan klasnic are examples .
this is a trend that probably has fifa president joseph blatter worried .
although a seasoned " man of the world " himself , he is the driving force behind fifa 's attempts to introduce the controversial 6 + 5 rule .
this states that each soccer club must field at least six players eligible to play for the national team of the country of the club .
without it , blatter is worried that the world cup will lose some of it appeal - and with it its marketability - if national teams continue losing their national identity . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "

but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .

without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .

without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .

shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .
missed chances on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece did what they could but it was n't enough russia , however , dominated the early play and could have gone ahead in the 15th minute when roman pavlyuchenko attempted to beat nikopolidis with a lob , but the keeper did well to palm it over the bar .
shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .

in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .
no campaigners looking further afield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declan ganley is planning to spread the word in mainland europe meanwhile , an irish businessman who runs the lobby group libertas , which was part of the rather motley irish " no " camp , is now considering taking the anti-lisbon message to the mainland .
without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "
he also called upon ireland to come to next weekend 's summit with some suggestions about how to resolve the situation . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .
no campaigners looking further afield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declan ganley is planning to spread the word in mainland europe meanwhile , an irish businessman who runs the lobby group libertas , which was part of the rather motley irish " no " camp , is now considering taking the anti-lisbon message to the mainland .
without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .

shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 15.06.2008 kosovo gets new constitution amid uncertainty over its future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is a further step toward strengthening kosovo kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu has signed a series of laws putting his country 's constitution into effect .
but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

" we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .
no campaigners looking further afield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declan ganley is planning to spread the word in mainland europe meanwhile , an irish businessman who runs the lobby group libertas , which was part of the rather motley irish " no " camp , is now considering taking the anti-lisbon message to the mainland .
without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "
he also called upon ireland to come to next weekend 's summit with some suggestions about how to resolve the situation . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .
missed chances on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece did what they could but it was n't enough russia , however , dominated the early play and could have gone ahead in the 15th minute when roman pavlyuchenko attempted to beat nikopolidis with a lob , but the keeper did well to palm it over the bar .
shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .
group d-day on wednesday sweden and russia face each other in their final group game on wednesday , with russia needing a win to finish second in the group , while sweden will go through with a draw .
russian forward ivan saenko said the game against sweden would be very tough .
" however , with the attitude that we showed today , we should be able to beat sweden to go through . "
after going through the motions against greece on wednesday , spain , will face either france , italy or romania in the quarter finals , while sweden or russia will take on tournament favourites netherlands . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 15.06.2008 kosovo gets new constitution amid uncertainty over its future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution is a further step toward strengthening kosovo kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu has signed a series of laws putting his country 's constitution into effect .
but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .

even so , sino-german relations seem to have finally recovered from the dalai lama 's visit to berlin last year . an open dialog between the state and civil society included the willingness and ability to criticize , steinmeier said at the opening of an urban development conference in the megacity of chongqing on sunday , june 15 . common responsibility worked best when the two parties were open towards each other and other countries .
" openness creates trust , " he said , adding that politics should not only limit criticism .
steinmeier told the conference in chongqing that globalization requires new policies .
" not just between centers of power in a multipolar world , but also between the state and civil society , " he added . the conference considered the challenges of growing urbanization in china .
it was part of a series of events under the theme " germany and china - together in motion " that has been ongoing since autumn 2007 . shocked by quake effects steinmeier had visited the earthquake affected area in the country 's south-west on sunday . " the situation is dramatic , " a visibly shaken steinmeier said at a camp in the area .
it was not possible to imagine from a distance what shock the country had gone through in the wake of the earthquake , the german minister said . the may 12 quake caused more than 70,000 deaths .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign minister got a close look at the situation on the ground steinmeier visited the cities of chengdu and dujiangyan in the earthquake-hit region to discuss the work of german aid organizations .
he said he was pleased that german relief for the victims had arrived so quickly . germany plans to assist in the reconstruction of eight schools . the german red cross has already set up a field hospital funded by the german foreign ministry to the tune of more than 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- . " a true friend " steinmeier said he welcomed developments in sino-german relations , adding that a " complete normalization " had come about . his three-day visit to china , which began friday , came in the wake of a period of frosty ties between berlin and beijing after chancellor angela merkel received the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , in september 2007 . after meeting steinmeier in beijing on friday , chinese foreign minister yang jiechi announced that the two countries aimed to resume their dialog on human rights issues . yang said the dialog would resume in the second half of this year . in a further indication of an improvement in the bilateral situation , chinese premier wen jiabao thanked germany for its earthquake relief aid , which amounted to some 20 million euros , and called germany " a true friend in need .

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .

shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "

he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .

shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .
no campaigners looking further afield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declan ganley is planning to spread the word in mainland europe meanwhile , an irish businessman who runs the lobby group libertas , which was part of the rather motley irish " no " camp , is now considering taking the anti-lisbon message to the mainland .
without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "
he also called upon ireland to come to next weekend 's summit with some suggestions about how to resolve the situation . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .
missed chances on both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece did what they could but it was n't enough russia , however , dominated the early play and could have gone ahead in the 15th minute when roman pavlyuchenko attempted to beat nikopolidis with a lob , but the keeper did well to palm it over the bar .
shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .
group d-day on wednesday sweden and russia face each other in their final group game on wednesday , with russia needing a win to finish second in the group , while sweden will go through with a draw .
russian forward ivan saenko said the game against sweden would be very tough .
" however , with the attitude that we showed today , we should be able to beat sweden to go through . "
after going through the motions against greece on wednesday , spain , will face either france , italy or romania in the quarter finals , while sweden or russia will take on tournament favourites netherlands . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .

without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "

he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .
direct elections for the top job bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schaeble does not have a reputation as a defender of civil rights schaeuble , who generally has more of a reputation in germany for circumscribing rather than increasing civil rights , suggested the introduction of direct voting for the post of european commission president , a post currently filled by jose manuel barroso , would be one way of bringing the eu closer to the people .
" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .
no campaigners looking further afield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declan ganley is planning to spread the word in mainland europe meanwhile , an irish businessman who runs the lobby group libertas , which was part of the rather motley irish " no " camp , is now considering taking the anti-lisbon message to the mainland .
without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "
he also called upon ireland to come to next weekend 's summit with some suggestions about how to resolve the situation . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .

" serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

even so , sino-german relations seem to have finally recovered from the dalai lama 's visit to berlin last year . an open dialog between the state and civil society included the willingness and ability to criticize , steinmeier said at the opening of an urban development conference in the megacity of chongqing on sunday , june 15 . common responsibility worked best when the two parties were open towards each other and other countries .
" openness creates trust , " he said , adding that politics should not only limit criticism .
steinmeier told the conference in chongqing that globalization requires new policies .
" not just between centers of power in a multipolar world , but also between the state and civil society , " he added . the conference considered the challenges of growing urbanization in china .

" a true friend " steinmeier said he welcomed developments in sino-german relations , adding that a " complete normalization " had come about . his three-day visit to china , which began friday , came in the wake of a period of frosty ties between berlin and beijing after chancellor angela merkel received the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , in september 2007 . after meeting steinmeier in beijing on friday , chinese foreign minister yang jiechi announced that the two countries aimed to resume their dialog on human rights issues . yang said the dialog would resume in the second half of this year . in a further indication of an improvement in the bilateral situation , chinese premier wen jiabao thanked germany for its earthquake relief aid , which amounted to some 20 million euros , and called germany " a true friend in need .

it 's a stinging message for the us president , who visited germany on friday and is currently in britain .
" something has happened that the europeans , as good friends of the us , have deeply regretted : a large loss of influence and respect for the us , " genscher told regional public radio swr last week .
" we immensely regret this .
and the president has done everything to widen the distance between the us and europe , " the veteran foreign minister said .
genscher : obama is a cultural revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher served as foreign minister for 18 years he recalled how european countries had pledged their support to the us following the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , invoking the nato mutual defense clause for the first time in the alliance 's history .
but bush had opted for an " alliance of the willing " instead of nato , which genscher described as " the alliance of the reliable and capable . "
genscher , foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 and a member of the free-market and liberal free democrats , noted that bush 's ratings were also at an historic low in the us itself .
the presidential candidacy of barack obama should be seen in this context , he said , describing his success as a " kind of cultural revolution . "

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .
it has earned him respect .
he once gave his players the book the art of war from sun tzu , a 2,500-year-old text on military strategy .
it 's not the sort of idea that a younger trainer would probably come up with .
international soccer a more leisurely atmosphere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobi kuhn is to step down after euro 2008 older coaches are also attracted to national team appointments , away from the arduous day-to-day business of league football and with more time to focus on conceptual planning .
it is one of the reasons ottmar hitzfeld at 59 has decided to take on the switzerland job after the tournament , succeeding kobi kuhn , five years his senior .
the younger coaches prefer club football , with its daily challenges and often greater financial reward .
croatia 's bilic flirted at the beginning of the year with the sv hamburg coaching job but decided to stay on as national team boss , but marco van basten is stepping down as dutch national team coach to take charge at ajax amsterdam .
his successor is bert van marwijk , 13 years his senior . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .

" something has happened that the europeans , as good friends of the us , have deeply regretted : a large loss of influence and respect for the us , " genscher told regional public radio swr last week .
" we immensely regret this .
and the president has done everything to widen the distance between the us and europe , " the veteran foreign minister said .
genscher : obama is a cultural revolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher served as foreign minister for 18 years he recalled how european countries had pledged their support to the us following the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 , invoking the nato mutual defense clause for the first time in the alliance 's history .
but bush had opted for an " alliance of the willing " instead of nato , which genscher described as " the alliance of the reliable and capable . "
genscher , foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 and a member of the free-market and liberal free democrats , noted that bush 's ratings were also at an historic low in the us itself .
the presidential candidacy of barack obama should be seen in this context , he said , describing his success as a " kind of cultural revolution . "
" this is an answer to the policies of bush and it is evident that this incredibly vital american democracy is recovering its powers and making the attempt to return to its great ideals , " genscher said .
iraq invasion marks trans-atlantic nadir us-german relations plummeted to a post-war low when gerhard schroeder , chancellor at the time of the us invasion of iraq in 2003 , based his successful campaign for re-election on opposition to the iraq war .
genscher was foreign minister under chancellors willy brandt , helmut schmidt and helmut kohl , holding office through major changes , such as brandt 's " ostpolitik " - opening up to the communist east - and german reunification under kohl . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
spain 's luis aragonés turns 70 this summer there 's no substitute for experience , at least as far as the coaches are concerned at euro 2008 .
white hair - or little hair at all - seems to be prerequisite for a place on the coaching bench . spain 's luis aragones and greece 's otto rehhagel will be celebrating their 70th birthdays this summer , making them the elder statesmen among the 16 coaches at the tournament in austria and switzerland .
half a dozen of them are already over 60 .
arsenal coach arsene wenger says he is surprised at the age of coaches at the tournament .
" twenty years ago you would have had just one coach over 60 and it would have been a miracle to have a coach on 70 .
" but that is obviously changing and if coaches can handle the pressure , which is less in a national team position than a club , they sometimes stay longer , " he said .
gerard houllier , a member of uefa 's technical delegation , is not surprised by the faith placed in the older generation .
experience a key factor , says uefa technical chief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marco van basten is one of the youngsters at the euros " experience is a key factor in order to be able to have success at this level , " said the former liverpool and lyon coach , who is analyzing games at euro 2008 for european soccer 's governing body .
twelve of the euro 2008 coaches are over 50 .
only joachim loew -lrb- germany / 48 years old -rrb- , roberto donadoni -lrb- italy / 44 -rrb- , marco van basten -lrb- netherlands / 43 -rrb- and relative youngster slaven bilic -lrb- croatia / 39 -rrb- have not yet reached their half centuries .
the average age of coaches at the tournament is 56.88 , slightly up on four years ago in portugal 56.81 .
rehhagel himself once said that there are no old or young players , only good or bad players .
the same could be said for the coaches .
a debt of gratitude to the older generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joachim loew says he learns a lot from his older rivals respect for their elders is something the younger coaching colleagues are glad to demonstrate .
loew said he could , of course , profit from the experience and expertise of a coach like poland 's dutchman leo beenhakker , 65 , before the two teams met .
beenhakker himself brings his experience into play when for instance defending himself against polish media criticism when he points out that with 40 years in the job he needs no lessons .
houllier says that with an increasing number of players under pressure or coping with the cult of stardom at an early age an older trainer takes on the role of a father figure .
even brazilian luiz felipe scolari is seen as a father figure among the portuguese .
for him , community feeling and family is important .
he is also very religious .
it has earned him respect .
he once gave his players the book the art of war from sun tzu , a 2,500-year-old text on military strategy .
it 's not the sort of idea that a younger trainer would probably come up with .
international soccer a more leisurely atmosphere bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kobi kuhn is to step down after euro 2008 older coaches are also attracted to national team appointments , away from the arduous day-to-day business of league football and with more time to focus on conceptual planning .
it is one of the reasons ottmar hitzfeld at 59 has decided to take on the switzerland job after the tournament , succeeding kobi kuhn , five years his senior .
the younger coaches prefer club football , with its daily challenges and often greater financial reward .
croatia 's bilic flirted at the beginning of the year with the sv hamburg coaching job but decided to stay on as national team boss , but marco van basten is stepping down as dutch national team coach to take charge at ajax amsterdam .
his successor is bert van marwijk , 13 years his senior . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

despite increasing interest in the sector in the us , it continues to shine . the future of solar energy keeps looking brighter in the united states .
san francisco lawmakers have just announced a rebate program for homeowners who install solar panels , or photovoltaics , on their rooftops .
out in the nevada desert , one of the world 's first solar power plants using trough collection went online in november .
and despite falling stock markets around the world , investments in us-based solar companies like first solar continue to be promoted as sound options . the us market for solar power is so enormous that organizers of intersolar , the world 's largest conference for industry professionals , have decided to offer an intersolar north america , to be held in san francisco in july . with all that potential for advancement , the us should have germany shaking in its boots .
but instead of taking away business , american interest in solar energy is giving the german market a healthy boost . room in the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's money to be made in harnessing the sun 's energy the original intersolar conference , which came to an end over the weekend , has moved from freiburg to munich to accommodate a record 40,000 visitors and 1,000 exhibitors .
and q-cells , the world 's largest independent solar cell manufacturer , based near leipzig , saw sales of nearly 270 million euros -lrb- $ 405 million -rrb- in the first quarter of 2008 - an increase of 65 percent over the first quarter of 2007 .
indeed , despite the recent decision by german lawmakers to cut subsidies for homeowners with solar panels , things do n't look to be slowing down in germany 's solar market any time soon . so what is it about this damp , often-dark , northern country that makes it the frontrunner in sun-produced energy ?
two words : research and technology . over the last decade , as the eu set lofty goals to reduce carbon emissions and germany 's decision to take nuclear power plants offline came to fruition , funding for solar research has increased hundredfold . research expenditures by private companies in the photovoltaic arena topped a whopping 166 million euros -lrb- $ 249 billion -rrb- in 2007 alone - up from 6 million euros in 2000 , according to the bundesverband solarwirtschaft , an association of german solar businesses . research institutes like the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- have likewise opened branches that specialize in developing new , more-efficient solar technologies .
the dlr 's institute of technical thermodynamics , for instance , has partnered with the solar institute juelich -lrb- sij -rrb- to construct germany 's first solar tower , a concentrating solar energy plant that can power thousands of homes . towers of power though the technology is still in its infancy , researchers welcomed the advance .
" it 's of strategic importance for research and development to have a working power plant in the vicinity , " professor johann-dietrich woerner of the dlr said when the plant went into construction in november . another forerunner in both solar thermal and photovoltaics energy production has been the fraunhofer institute for solar energy systems -lrb- ise -rrb- in freiburg , germany 's sunniest city .
at the ise , researchers have increased the sun-capturing abilities of solar cells by helping uncover new semiconductor materials that can be used in thin-film technology .
scientists hope that thin film - material layers that range from fractions of a nanometer to several micrometers in thickness - will reduce the costs of photovoltaic systems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : photovoltaics remain germany 's top solar export the ise has also developed creative integration techniques - designing solar panels that can be hung from the facades of buildings instead of being set on rooftops . the fraunhofer recently opened shop near the massachusetts institute of technology -lrb- mit -rrb- , one of the united states ' leading universities , and is working together with mit to pursue its solar energy research . " up to now the market for solar energy has been disproportionately low in the usa , " said professor roland schindler , executive director of the mit-fraunhofer center for sustainable energy systems .
" in our work with the research scientists at mit , we would like to create mechanisms which will support dynamic growth in this area . " courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but many diplomatic and legal question marks still hover over the fledgling state 's future . " we reached a historic moment to complete the process of completing our statehood , " sejdiu said on sunday , june 15 , after signing into law the new constitution , which was passed by parliament two months ago .
the ceremony was attended by representatives of more than 40 countries which have recognized kosovo . still , doubts over kosovo 's future linger as the united nations , which had governed the former serbian province since nato intervened against belgrade in 1999 , remains unable to let go of it owing to the power of serbian ally and un security council member russia . moscow is backing belgrade 's claim of ownership over kosovo , which serbs see as their heartland province .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's prime minister hashim thaci and president fatmir sejdiu -lrb- from left -rrb- belgrade on sunday said it considered the constitution illegal and dangerous . " serbia does not accept the proclamation of kosovo 's constitution as a legal fact , " president boris tadic told reporters in the serbian capital .
the move was " a political event with ... harmful consequences , " he added . kosovo declared independence four months ago and was quickly recognized by the major western powers .
russia , however , threatened to block a roadmap to independence designed by a un mediator , martti ahtisaari , in 2007 .
shift of authority from un to locals the new kosovar constitution envisaged the transfer of authority from the un mission -lrb- unmik -rrb- to local institutions .
unmik was introduced to kosovo by un resolution 1244 nine years ago . but the un security council , deeply divided over kosovo , now can not undo the resolution , so unmik legally remains in place though developments have clearly overtaken it . the new developments include kosovo 's proclamation of independence , its recognition by the us and its allies and the eulex law-enforcing mission sent by the european union to aid kosovo in its first sovereign steps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has over 2,000 soldiers stationed in kosovo because of the " new situation on the ground , " un chief ban ki-moon last week proposed to reshape unmik and leave it in pristina to share power with pristina and eulex , instead of moving it out of kosovo 's way .
opposition to ban the plan angered the ethnic albanians - a 90-percent majority in kosovo - who want unmik to make way for the much smaller eulex .
officials , such as assembly speaker jakup krasniqi , have said that ban is afraid to recognize the reality of kosovo 's independence . at the same time , serbia dismissed ban 's plan as an illegal change of the un mandate in kosovo and an attempt to let eulex - to which belgrade vehemently objects as a facilitator of kosovo 's independence - in through a back door . adding to the confusion are the minority serbs , mostly grouped in the northern mitrovica enclave , who boycott both pristina authorities and are openly hostile to eulex .
ethnic serbs have said they will launch their own parallel structures of authority in late june . neither the international missions nor central pristina institutions have so far attempted to assert their authority , and it may remain so under the new constitution . the declaration of independence in february was followed by violent serb protests in the north , which were encouraged and aided by belgrade .

germany 's interior minister has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble has called for more transparency in the european union , following ireland 's rejection of the eu reform treaty .
one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .
he said the bloc had to become understandable for everyone .
" people do n't like some aspects of the politics in brussels because it is not sufficiently transparent , " schaeuble told the german newspaper welt am sonntag .

" i would be in favor of us voting one day in a european election for the president of the european president , the leading person in europe in the future . "
but the cdu politician also warned against placing too much importance on the outcome of the irish vote on the lisbon treaty , designed to make decision-making in the enlarged 27-member bloc more streamlined and more democratic .
" of course we have to take the irish referendum seriously .
but a few million irish can not decide on behalf of 495 million europeans , " he said .
schaeuble said that eu heads of state and government would now have to find a solution to the crisis at the summit next weekend in brussels and stated his confidence for the future .
" i am quite sure that we have a clear majority in favor of the continuation of the process of european unificiation . "
the german government , along with france and the european commission , has called for the ratification process to be continued despite ireland 's no-vote .
speaking during a visit to china on saturday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- expressed his hope that " ireland would clear the way for a while for the process of continued integration of the 26 other states . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yes camp had initially been expected to win in ireland steinmeier also expressed his personal disappointment at the outcome of thursday 's poll .
germany helped to save the lisbon treaty from extinction during its eu presidency last year .
" we worked day and night and over the weekend to create a difficult compromise , " he said .
but he also acknowledged that it was not possible to ban eu referenda in individual member states .
ireland is the only one of the 27 eu countries whose electorate was given the chance to vote on the treaty .
the globalization critics attac criticized the plans to decouple ireland from the ratification process , saying it showed the eu was not concerned about the will of its citizens .

without giving any further details , declan ganley said he would visit europe to see if he could build some kind of " pan-european organization . "
the president of the european parliament , hans-gert poettering , has called for the process of eu enlargement to be temporarily stopped .
the cdu politician said there should for a while be no further accessions with the exception perhaps of croatia .
he also raised the idea of a two-speed europe again , a concept called for by schaeuble as early as 1994 .
" we need a debate about the future of europe .
the idea of a europe of two speeds , in which a core group of members moves ahead , will play a role . "
but poettering also stressed he would prefer all eu countries " to travel down the path towards a common future together . "

one of his proposals is the direct election of the european commission president . wolfgang schaeuble believes the irish no camp 's 53.4 to 46.6 percent victory in thursday 's referendum was a result of the eu 's remoteness from the people .

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "
unlike their match against sweden where they used five at the back , greek played a four-man backline .

shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .
although greece pushed men forward in the final minutes in search of the equalizer that would have kept them in the competition , they could not break through the russian defence .

the only goal of the game came in the 33rd minute after a terrible mix-up in the greek defence . goalkeeper antonis nikopolidis chased after an innocuous ball , but was beaten to it by sergey semak , whose overhead cross was tapped in from close range by the unmarked zenit st petersburg midfielder konstantin zyryanov .
the result leaves greece bottom of the group without a point from their two games .
russia and sweden , who earlier in the day lost 2-1 to spain , have three points each and meet in their final game .
this means greece can not finish second behind group d winners spain , and their match on wednesday is only of statistical interest .
russia created a host of chances and were virtually unrecognizable from the side that was hammered 4-1 by spain in their opening match .
" my biggest worry was not the football we play as everyone could see in some parts of the spain game that this team could play good football with a lot of movement , " said russia coach guus hiddink .
" the result from tonight is a consequence of good football but is based on everyone doing his defensive job very well . "
greece shrugs off criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece 's german coach otto rehhagel did n't expect another euro 2004 after the game greek coach otto rehhagel dismissed criticism that he played too defensively .
" we always played what was right for us .
sweden also played defensively against spain .
we can play anything we want to , we play to win , . "
he said .
" i am not that disappointed as i knew beforehand what we can do .
i always said that everything had to be right to beat russia .
the goal was practically an own goal , but the russians are excellent sprinters and players . "
he said he would not make any decisions on his future at this stage .
" an hour after the game every person is beyond reason .
so now we will play our last game , then i will go on holiday and then i will look at things . "

shortly afterwards it was euro 2004 hero angelos charisteas who nearly gave the defending champions the lead when vasilis torosidis crossed into the area and charisteas just failed to connect .
the ball crashed against igor semshov and rolled just past the upright .
just at a time when greece were getting into the game , the russians scored out of nowhere when diniyar bilyaletdinov 's speculative cross into the greek area led to nikopolidis 's moment of madness .
in the second half greece pushed forward looking for their first goal of the tournament .
this allowed the russians plenty of space for counter attacks .
pavlyuchenko had three chances in the second half , but twice pulled wide and once saw nikopolidis push the ball away for a corner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek fans were n't cheering later midway through the second half , greece had a good chance for the equalizer after charisteas and ionnis amanatides combined well in the area before pushing the ball back to angelos basinas , but his shot flew over the bar .
the greeks finally had the ball in the back of the net four minutes from the end , but theofanis gekas was ruled offside .

lukas podolski 's dilemma shone a spotlight on players ' loyalties when referee tom henning oevreboe blew the whistle for the start of germany 's first match at the euro finals last sunday , there were 13 players with polish citizenship on the field . however , it was not that the norwegian referee failed to count poland 's line-up , it was just that germany started the game with two polish-born players .
and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .
the defeat prompted an angry polish politician to call for the withdrawal of polish citizenship for players who play for other countries .
" if someone performs in the colors of a foreign state , there 's already a desire there to renounce citizenship .
you ca n't say it more clearly .
and the president should interpret that fact like this : that it 's intentional , " miroslaw orzechowski said .
podolski , certainly , did not celebrate his two goals as one would expect .
" of course i have mixed feelings .
i have a large family in poland .
i have to respect the country , " he said .
poland 's coach leo beenhakker said he understood why so many players are appearing for countries in which they were not born .
" the world has changed , " he said .
nations clambering for stars willing to switch nationalities beenhakker himself has a " foreigner " in his team .
in fact , brazilian-born roger guerreiro 's polish citizenship was rushed through by polish officials to enable him to play at the euro .
the midfielder arrived in poland in 2006 and was only granted citizenship in april 2008 .
guerreiro is not the only brazilian who is displaying his talents at the showpiece of european continental soccer .
aurelio brito dos prazeres played for flamengo before moving to turkey .
he then changed his name and became mehmet aurelio and started playing for turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art deco : portugal 's brazilian portugal 's deco , kevin kuranyi , who plays for germany , and marcos senna , who plays for spain , are other brazilian-born players who are in their adopted countries ' squads .
another brazilian who narrowly missed out on making a euro squad is juventus striker amauri , who said he was looking forward to receiving his italian passport .
" had the passport arrived two months ago , maybe -lsb- coach roberto -rsb- donadoni would have taken me to austria and switzerland -lsb- for euro 2008 -rsb- .
i hope to be in south africa -lsb- for the 2010 world cup -rsb- .
i and -lsb- luca -rsb- toni together would not be bad at all , " he told italian media last week .
former colonies are target rich envirnonments if brazil is the country of choice for national teams , africa seems to be the continent of choice .
it is not only the french , who have traditionally made use of their former colonies to boost their national teams , but also several other countries that have african players in their squad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is famous for having stars from former colonies les bleus are playing with patrice evra -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- , steve mandanda -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- , jean-alain boumsong -lrb- born in cameroon -rrb- , patrick vieira -lrb- born in senegal -rrb- and claude makelele -lrb- born in dr congo -rrb- in their squad .
swiss defender johan djourou was born in the ivory coast capital abidjan , and his teammate , gelson fernandes , comes from cape verde .
eastern europeans the newest soccer tourists several of players from eastern europe have found a new soccer home elsewhere , like austrians ivica vastic -lrb- born in split -rrb- and gyorgy garics -lrb- born in hungary -rrb- or eldin jakupovic -lrb- born in bosnia-herzegovina , yugoslavia -rrb- , who now plays for switzerland .
there are also several eastern european players who have opted to play for the country of their origin , rather than birth .
many of them are the children of parents who settled in western europe in pursuit of a better life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia 's robert kovac and brother niko were born in germany ivan rakitic -lrb- born in switzerland , plays for croatia -rrb- , as well as german-born croatian players niko and robert kovac and ivan klasnic are examples .
this is a trend that probably has fifa president joseph blatter worried .

and , ironically , it was miroslav klose and lukas podolski who combined for both goals , with podolski scoring in the 20th and 72nd minute to give his " new " country a 2-0 victory against his " old " country .

the files were found on the same day as the bbc was handed top secret papers on al-qaeda .
a treasury spokesman said the government was " extremely concerned " .
the tories are calling for controls to protect secret official information .
the documents , about a meeting of financial crime experts , apparently include briefing notes for a meeting of the international financial action task force -lrb- fatf -rrb- to be held in 11 downing street next week .

advertisement footage showing the extent of the flood damage flooding in southern china has killed at least 55 people and forced more than one million to flee their homes , the government says .
torrential downpours have affected nine provinces , china 's civil affairs ministry says .
more rain is expected in the coming days , forecasters warn .
among those provinces badly hit is sichuan , which is still reeling from last month 's massive earthquake .
some 87,000 people were killed or missing after the 12 may earthquake .
farm land submerged china 's civil affairs ministry says nearly 1.3 million people have now fled their homes in the hardest hit regions as the bad weather continues .
in pictures : china floods television showed boats cruising city streets , homeowners trying to bail out their homes and rescuers handing out supplies of bottled water .
the flooding has submerged large areas of farm land and destroyed 6,600 homes in guangdong and jiangxi provinces , the official xinhua news agency reports .
it says that many roads throughout the affected areas have been covered by landslides .
the flooding in the pearl river delta is the worst for 50 years , forcing the guangdong government to issue an emergency flood alert throughout the province , xinhua says .
china 's rainy season causes chaos every year , often leaving many dead and forcing millions to leave their homes .
in the past , the chinese authorities have warned that climate change may make the problem worse , the bbc 's daniel griffiths in beijing says .

adb managing director rajat m nag said inflation in 2008 would exceed the 5.1 % annual figure predicted in april .
rising fuel and food prices were the chief dangers behind inflation that affected asia " good growth story " .
rising inflation could also hit investment and corporate earnings , and destabilise governments in the region .
in asia , roughly about a billion people are vulnerable to the food and fuel price increases rajat m nag , asian development bank on friday india said its inflation had risen at its fastest rate in seven years .
and earlier in june south korea said its inflation had hit a seven-year high as a result of rising energy and food costs .
in vietnam inflation is more than 25 % and the government has said the issue is the biggest challenge it faces .
singapore , thailand , and the philippines and indonesia are facing inflation rates of between 7.5 % and 11 % .
' regressive ' taxation the adb has forecast 7.6 % growth for the region in 2008 , down from 8.7 % in 2007 , which was the highest in two decades .
mr nag said asian monetary and fiscal authorities should " recognise inflation as a very major concern " and indicated that raising interest rates could be one solution .
inflation " can endanger growth in asia , " he said , adding that " central banks should take all steps , including looking at rates as what india has done quite appropriately . "
on wednesday india 's central bank raised a key short-term borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point to 8.0 % .
rising food prices have been spurred by rising fuel costs that have increased production and transport costs .

" inflation is the most regressive form of taxation and it hits the poor most .
in asia , roughly about a billion people are vulnerable to the food and fuel price increases , " mr nag said .
he said governments had to ensure " targeted cash support " for the poor to protect them from the price increases , he said .
asia is home to two-thirds of the world 's poor .
it cut its poverty rate to about 19 % from 33 % in 1990 , but mr nag said this improvement was under threat because of inflation .
in april the asian development bank offered to support countries dealing with the effects of rising food prices .
