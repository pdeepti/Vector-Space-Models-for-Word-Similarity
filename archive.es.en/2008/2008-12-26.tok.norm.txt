speaking with ap news agency , minister of culture bernd neumann said that construction on the memorial will start in 2010 and should be complete by 2012 .
berlin has set aside 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for the project .
the architects should pay special attention to their entries , said neumann , because the memorial should n't just remind people of the wall and reunification , but rather all “ positive occurrences in german history , starting with the freedom movements in the 19th century . ”
the christian democrat politician also announced that the position of the memorial has already been decided on .
it will stand in central berlin , near the berliner city palace -lrb- berliner schloss -rrb- on top of the 80 by 40-meter pedestal once occupied by a memorial to kaiser wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .
many of the 250 prisoners in the camp have been held for years without charge , prompting harsh criticism from human rights organizations . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than half of the league ’ s teams have serious holes to fill . atrocious attack defense may win games , but occasionally you also have to score a few goals - something that apparently has gone lost on cottbus ' strike farce .
with only 12 goals in 17 games , the drought up front is clearly a team effort - so take your pick between jelic , angelov and rangelov .
with zero goals and zero assists , edmond kapplani would do well at cottbus .
unfortunately for karlruhe , the albanian not only plays for , but regularly starts for them and has proved a total waste of space .
look for the southern-german side to acquire a replacement - or face relegation .
molten midfield question : who did hamburg sign to take over for departed playmaker rafael van der vaart ?
answer : thiago neves .
never heard of him ?
that 's because the 6.5-million-euro brazilian has failed to crack the starting line-up , playing in only six league matches and disappointing in every one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have been looking down , down , down for neves in hamburg at this summer 's euro 2008 , stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger spoke openly about inheriting michael ballack 's place in the german national team .
maybe all the talking tired him out .
der hammer 's lone goal came on the first day of the season , and he 's been pretty much invisible every since .
dutchman orlando engelaar also attracted notice at euro 2008 , prompting schalke to shell out 6 million euros .
they 're still waiting for the first goal from the giant midfielder , who seems too slow and clumsy for the bundesliga .
he was easily the worst player on the pitch in the blues ' match against hoffenheim - taking mercy on football fans , he duly got himself sent off .
at the start of the season , bochum celebrated the return of prodigal son and former german national paul freier .
now they probably wished he 'd stayed away .
freier leads the league in yellow cards , but that 's the only superlative to his name .
the once fine midfielder looks over the hill and unlikely to help bochum in their relegation fight .
dire defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim put five goals past hanover werder bremen have had a horrific season by their standards .
their troubles started when normally reliable defender per mertesacker got himself foolishly sent off in the sixth round .
at the half-way mark , bremen has been plagued by defensive lapses and lack of discipline - mertesacker shares the blame .
moenchengladbach 's revolving-door back four has been the league 's most porous , conceding an appalling 35 goals .
the one constant in this tale of misery has been patrick paauwe .
he may be the best of the worst , but he 's still earned his spot in dw 's hall of shame .
hanover came into this season hoping to challenge for the top five .
but half-way through the campaign and 32 conceded goals later , the team is going to have its hands full just keeping their distance from the relegation fight .
veterans frank fahrenhorst and steven cherundolo need to step up , if hanover are to stay up .

still , as bayern 's final game against stuttgart showed , rensing has been rather feeble dealing with high balls into the area .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 26.12.2008 president of iran gives alternative christmas message in uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president was a controversial choice - even by channel 4 standards british broadcaster channel 4 has been broadcasting an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .

the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .
many of the 250 prisoners in the camp have been held for years without charge , prompting harsh criticism from human rights organizations . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has set aside 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for the project .
the architects should pay special attention to their entries , said neumann , because the memorial should n't just remind people of the wall and reunification , but rather all “ positive occurrences in german history , starting with the freedom movements in the 19th century . ”
the christian democrat politician also announced that the position of the memorial has already been decided on .

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .
many of the 250 prisoners in the camp have been held for years without charge , prompting harsh criticism from human rights organizations . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .

some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .
many of the 250 prisoners in the camp have been held for years without charge , prompting harsh criticism from human rights organizations . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .
many of the 250 prisoners in the camp have been held for years without charge , prompting harsh criticism from human rights organizations . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .

the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 26.12.2008 president of iran gives alternative christmas message in uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president was a controversial choice - even by channel 4 standards british broadcaster channel 4 has been broadcasting an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

more than half of the league ’ s teams have serious holes to fill . atrocious attack defense may win games , but occasionally you also have to score a few goals - something that apparently has gone lost on cottbus ' strike farce .
with only 12 goals in 17 games , the drought up front is clearly a team effort - so take your pick between jelic , angelov and rangelov .
with zero goals and zero assists , edmond kapplani would do well at cottbus .
unfortunately for karlruhe , the albanian not only plays for , but regularly starts for them and has proved a total waste of space .
look for the southern-german side to acquire a replacement - or face relegation .
molten midfield question : who did hamburg sign to take over for departed playmaker rafael van der vaart ?
answer : thiago neves .
never heard of him ?
that 's because the 6.5-million-euro brazilian has failed to crack the starting line-up , playing in only six league matches and disappointing in every one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have been looking down , down , down for neves in hamburg at this summer 's euro 2008 , stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger spoke openly about inheriting michael ballack 's place in the german national team .
maybe all the talking tired him out .
der hammer 's lone goal came on the first day of the season , and he 's been pretty much invisible every since .
dutchman orlando engelaar also attracted notice at euro 2008 , prompting schalke to shell out 6 million euros .
they 're still waiting for the first goal from the giant midfielder , who seems too slow and clumsy for the bundesliga .
he was easily the worst player on the pitch in the blues ' match against hoffenheim - taking mercy on football fans , he duly got himself sent off .
at the start of the season , bochum celebrated the return of prodigal son and former german national paul freier .
now they probably wished he 'd stayed away .
freier leads the league in yellow cards , but that 's the only superlative to his name .
the once fine midfielder looks over the hill and unlikely to help bochum in their relegation fight .
dire defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim put five goals past hanover werder bremen have had a horrific season by their standards .
their troubles started when normally reliable defender per mertesacker got himself foolishly sent off in the sixth round .
at the half-way mark , bremen has been plagued by defensive lapses and lack of discipline - mertesacker shares the blame .
moenchengladbach 's revolving-door back four has been the league 's most porous , conceding an appalling 35 goals .
the one constant in this tale of misery has been patrick paauwe .
he may be the best of the worst , but he 's still earned his spot in dw 's hall of shame .
hanover came into this season hoping to challenge for the top five .
but half-way through the campaign and 32 conceded goals later , the team is going to have its hands full just keeping their distance from the relegation fight .
veterans frank fahrenhorst and steven cherundolo need to step up , if hanover are to stay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rensing 's inexperience has cost bayern some crucial points gruesome goal only one man has ever successfully replaced oliver kahn so we do n't want to be too hard on bayern 's michael rensing .
still , as bayern 's final game against stuttgart showed , rensing has been rather feeble dealing with high balls into the area .
rensing is quite good on his line , but it 's hard not to think that the champions would top the league right now , if they had jens lehmann minding the posts . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than half of the league ’ s teams have serious holes to fill . atrocious attack defense may win games , but occasionally you also have to score a few goals - something that apparently has gone lost on cottbus ' strike farce .
with only 12 goals in 17 games , the drought up front is clearly a team effort - so take your pick between jelic , angelov and rangelov .

molten midfield question : who did hamburg sign to take over for departed playmaker rafael van der vaart ?
answer : thiago neves .
never heard of him ?
that 's because the 6.5-million-euro brazilian has failed to crack the starting line-up , playing in only six league matches and disappointing in every one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have been looking down , down , down for neves in hamburg at this summer 's euro 2008 , stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger spoke openly about inheriting michael ballack 's place in the german national team .

they 're still waiting for the first goal from the giant midfielder , who seems too slow and clumsy for the bundesliga .

at the start of the season , bochum celebrated the return of prodigal son and former german national paul freier .
now they probably wished he 'd stayed away .
freier leads the league in yellow cards , but that 's the only superlative to his name .
the once fine midfielder looks over the hill and unlikely to help bochum in their relegation fight .

their troubles started when normally reliable defender per mertesacker got himself foolishly sent off in the sixth round .
at the half-way mark , bremen has been plagued by defensive lapses and lack of discipline - mertesacker shares the blame .
moenchengladbach 's revolving-door back four has been the league 's most porous , conceding an appalling 35 goals .

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .

the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .

some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than half of the league ’ s teams have serious holes to fill . atrocious attack defense may win games , but occasionally you also have to score a few goals - something that apparently has gone lost on cottbus ' strike farce .

that 's because the 6.5-million-euro brazilian has failed to crack the starting line-up , playing in only six league matches and disappointing in every one .

at the start of the season , bochum celebrated the return of prodigal son and former german national paul freier .
now they probably wished he 'd stayed away .
freier leads the league in yellow cards , but that 's the only superlative to his name .
the once fine midfielder looks over the hill and unlikely to help bochum in their relegation fight .

moenchengladbach 's revolving-door back four has been the league 's most porous , conceding an appalling 35 goals .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 26.12.2008 president of iran gives alternative christmas message in uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president was a controversial choice - even by channel 4 standards british broadcaster channel 4 has been broadcasting an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

two decades later berlin is planning a monument to commemorate the event . the german government has announced that in honor of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , next november it will release the results of an architecture competition to design a memorial commemorating german unification .
speaking with ap news agency , minister of culture bernd neumann said that construction on the memorial will start in 2010 and should be complete by 2012 .
berlin has set aside 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for the project .

the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .

the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

answer : thiago neves .
never heard of him ?
that 's because the 6.5-million-euro brazilian has failed to crack the starting line-up , playing in only six league matches and disappointing in every one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have been looking down , down , down for neves in hamburg at this summer 's euro 2008 , stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger spoke openly about inheriting michael ballack 's place in the german national team .

dutchman orlando engelaar also attracted notice at euro 2008 , prompting schalke to shell out 6 million euros .
they 're still waiting for the first goal from the giant midfielder , who seems too slow and clumsy for the bundesliga .
he was easily the worst player on the pitch in the blues ' match against hoffenheim - taking mercy on football fans , he duly got himself sent off .
at the start of the season , bochum celebrated the return of prodigal son and former german national paul freier .
now they probably wished he 'd stayed away .
freier leads the league in yellow cards , but that 's the only superlative to his name .
the once fine midfielder looks over the hill and unlikely to help bochum in their relegation fight .

their troubles started when normally reliable defender per mertesacker got himself foolishly sent off in the sixth round .
at the half-way mark , bremen has been plagued by defensive lapses and lack of discipline - mertesacker shares the blame .
moenchengladbach 's revolving-door back four has been the league 's most porous , conceding an appalling 35 goals .
the one constant in this tale of misery has been patrick paauwe .
he may be the best of the worst , but he 's still earned his spot in dw 's hall of shame .
hanover came into this season hoping to challenge for the top five .
but half-way through the campaign and 32 conceded goals later , the team is going to have its hands full just keeping their distance from the relegation fight .

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .

overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .
many of the 250 prisoners in the camp have been held for years without charge , prompting harsh criticism from human rights organizations . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has set aside 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for the project .

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .
many of the 250 prisoners in the camp have been held for years without charge , prompting harsh criticism from human rights organizations . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .

" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '

overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .

the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 26.12.2008 president of iran gives alternative christmas message in uk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian president was a controversial choice - even by channel 4 standards british broadcaster channel 4 has been broadcasting an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

that 's because the 6.5-million-euro brazilian has failed to crack the starting line-up , playing in only six league matches and disappointing in every one .

der hammer 's lone goal came on the first day of the season , and he 's been pretty much invisible every since .
dutchman orlando engelaar also attracted notice at euro 2008 , prompting schalke to shell out 6 million euros .
they 're still waiting for the first goal from the giant midfielder , who seems too slow and clumsy for the bundesliga .
he was easily the worst player on the pitch in the blues ' match against hoffenheim - taking mercy on football fans , he duly got himself sent off .
at the start of the season , bochum celebrated the return of prodigal son and former german national paul freier .
now they probably wished he 'd stayed away .
freier leads the league in yellow cards , but that 's the only superlative to his name .
the once fine midfielder looks over the hill and unlikely to help bochum in their relegation fight .
dire defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim put five goals past hanover werder bremen have had a horrific season by their standards .
their troubles started when normally reliable defender per mertesacker got himself foolishly sent off in the sixth round .
at the half-way mark , bremen has been plagued by defensive lapses and lack of discipline - mertesacker shares the blame .
moenchengladbach 's revolving-door back four has been the league 's most porous , conceding an appalling 35 goals .
the one constant in this tale of misery has been patrick paauwe .
he may be the best of the worst , but he 's still earned his spot in dw 's hall of shame .
hanover came into this season hoping to challenge for the top five .
but half-way through the campaign and 32 conceded goals later , the team is going to have its hands full just keeping their distance from the relegation fight .
veterans frank fahrenhorst and steven cherundolo need to step up , if hanover are to stay up .

berlin has set aside 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for the project .
the architects should pay special attention to their entries , said neumann , because the memorial should n't just remind people of the wall and reunification , but rather all “ positive occurrences in german history , starting with the freedom movements in the 19th century . ”
the christian democrat politician also announced that the position of the memorial has already been decided on .
it will stand in central berlin , near the berliner city palace -lrb- berliner schloss -rrb- on top of the 80 by 40-meter pedestal once occupied by a memorial to kaiser wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than half of the league ’ s teams have serious holes to fill . atrocious attack defense may win games , but occasionally you also have to score a few goals - something that apparently has gone lost on cottbus ' strike farce .
with only 12 goals in 17 games , the drought up front is clearly a team effort - so take your pick between jelic , angelov and rangelov .
with zero goals and zero assists , edmond kapplani would do well at cottbus .
unfortunately for karlruhe , the albanian not only plays for , but regularly starts for them and has proved a total waste of space .
look for the southern-german side to acquire a replacement - or face relegation .
molten midfield question : who did hamburg sign to take over for departed playmaker rafael van der vaart ?
answer : thiago neves .
never heard of him ?
that 's because the 6.5-million-euro brazilian has failed to crack the starting line-up , playing in only six league matches and disappointing in every one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have been looking down , down , down for neves in hamburg at this summer 's euro 2008 , stuttgart 's thomas hitzlsperger spoke openly about inheriting michael ballack 's place in the german national team .
maybe all the talking tired him out .
der hammer 's lone goal came on the first day of the season , and he 's been pretty much invisible every since .
dutchman orlando engelaar also attracted notice at euro 2008 , prompting schalke to shell out 6 million euros .
they 're still waiting for the first goal from the giant midfielder , who seems too slow and clumsy for the bundesliga .
he was easily the worst player on the pitch in the blues ' match against hoffenheim - taking mercy on football fans , he duly got himself sent off .
at the start of the season , bochum celebrated the return of prodigal son and former german national paul freier .
now they probably wished he 'd stayed away .
freier leads the league in yellow cards , but that 's the only superlative to his name .
the once fine midfielder looks over the hill and unlikely to help bochum in their relegation fight .
dire defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim put five goals past hanover werder bremen have had a horrific season by their standards .
their troubles started when normally reliable defender per mertesacker got himself foolishly sent off in the sixth round .
at the half-way mark , bremen has been plagued by defensive lapses and lack of discipline - mertesacker shares the blame .
moenchengladbach 's revolving-door back four has been the league 's most porous , conceding an appalling 35 goals .
the one constant in this tale of misery has been patrick paauwe .
he may be the best of the worst , but he 's still earned his spot in dw 's hall of shame .
hanover came into this season hoping to challenge for the top five .
but half-way through the campaign and 32 conceded goals later , the team is going to have its hands full just keeping their distance from the relegation fight .
veterans frank fahrenhorst and steven cherundolo need to step up , if hanover are to stay up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rensing 's inexperience has cost bayern some crucial points gruesome goal only one man has ever successfully replaced oliver kahn so we do n't want to be too hard on bayern 's michael rensing .
still , as bayern 's final game against stuttgart showed , rensing has been rather feeble dealing with high balls into the area .
rensing is quite good on his line , but it 's hard not to think that the champions would top the league right now , if they had jens lehmann minding the posts . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

france wants a common eu policy on released prisoners , but opinions differ . the french foreign ministry called for a common european union policy friday , dec .
26 , on how to deal with prisoners currently held in the us prison in guantanamo bay on cuba after the camp is closed as planned by president-elect barack obama in 2009 .
the ministry in paris said in a statement that the french government welcomed obama 's plan to close the prison , where suspected terrorists are held , but there had to be a common european policy on any prisoners being relocated to europe .
it was not immediately clear if france was willing to accept any of the former guantanamo prisoners .
a representative of the ministry said friday that it would not be commenting on the issue at present .
opinions vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president-elect barack obama promised to shut down the prison if he won the white house the word from other european nations ranges from open to adamantly against the idea .
the german government is already preparing to receive guantanamo detainees , while spain has also said it is willing to accept some of them .
the netherlands was the least open to a european-wide plan , ruling out accepting any newly freed inmates .
speaking to french news agency afp , a dutch foreign ministry spokesman said that if inmates are not to be tried but can not return to their own countries , they are first and foremost the responsibility of the country which arrested and imprisoned them , the united states .
britain has taken charge of nine detainees who are british nationals and four british residents , and said earlier this week it would consider any more us requests on a case-by-case basis .
ca n't go home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many prisoners can not return to their home countries obama has promised to close the detention facility , which is part of a sovereign us naval base on cuba , after taking office next month .
while that move has been greeted by many , it has also raised the tricky question of what to do with the remaining 250 inmates .
some of the prisoners , alleged " enemy combatants " captured since 2001 by us and allied forces around the world , are no longer considered a threat by us authorities and will be resettled .
the prisoners come from various countries , mostly in the middle east , and some may want to go home .
others face renewed arrest in their homelands and could face torture or lengthy incarcerations .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "

deutsche welle correspondent clare cavanaugh was in london and gives her input on this year 's controversial speaker . dw-world : what was your impression of the speech ?
clare cavanaugh : if you 'd had your eyes shut , you would imagine that you were listening to the archbishop of canterbury , the head of the anglican church , not the president of iran , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
he was talking about christianity , he was talking about congratulating the people of britain on the anniversary of the birth of jesus christ .
this is not something you expected from the supposedly firebrand president of iran .
was it a disappointment ?
when i saw a couple of excerpts yesterday , i have to admit that i thought it was rather boring .
i think it was slightly dull .
it certainly was n't what people were expecting .
certainly the british government and a number of mps and a number of jewish groups had , before the broadcast was even made , expressed their disappointment and even anger that channel 4 , the broadcaster , had approached mahmoud ahmadinejad to ask him to record this message .
they said that he held anti-semitic views , anti-homosexual views , and that he was a dangerous person essentially and should n't be given this platform to speak .
so it was n't what we were expecting at all .
why did channel 4 do this ?
were they trying to do something scandalous so that they would make the newspapers the next day ?
i suspect that channel 4 had a very different opinion of what mahmoud ahmadinejad would have said .
i would imagine they were thinking that he would be spouting some anti-western rhetoric ; the sort of thing we have to come to know him for , or at least we think we know him for .
in fact , channel 4 has been doing an alternative christmas message since 1993 .
the first one was delivered by a gay icon called quentin crisp , who is now no longer with us .
then , it was called the “ alternative queen 's message , ” delivered by a gay man .
it went up against the broadcast on christmas day of her majesty the queen , which is broadcast at 3:00 p.m. on bbc one .
they wanted to be controversial ; certainly they wanted to be controversial with their first broadcast , and i suspect that 's what they thought they would get from ahmadinejad .
we 've had some unusual figures speaking on this alternative christmas message .
we 've had brigitte bardot , the french actress .
we 've had sharon osbourne , who is married to ozzy osbourne , the ex-rock star , and former x factor judge in the uk .
and we 've had jamie oliver , who is a celebrity chef in the uk .
last year 's message was given by major andrew stockton , a british soldier who lost his arm fighting in afghanistan .
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster and they 're competing with bbc one assume ?
channel 4 is a commercial broadcaster , but they do get a public subsidy .
so they may be in hot water over this because potentially they could lose that subsidy if it 's found that this broadcast caused enough controversy .
certainly it had up until the time it was broadcast , and then we discovered it was a rather dry message that he was delivering .
i 'm sure channel 4 is now sitting back and thinking to themselves that was n't such a great idea .
has it had this kind of experience in the past ?
not at all .
it 's always been a bit of a scandal , or something funny , amusing , alternative .
they 've never gone for a figure like this ; somebody they would expect would provoke or cause outrage .
certainly they got that sort of reaction before the broadcast .
what we have to wait and see is if that will be the reaction after the broadcast .
is there any word yet on how many people viewed it ?
no .
channel 4 is one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the uk out of five , but it does n't normally pick up the kind of the ratings of , for example , a soap opera on the bbc , which might pick up 20 million viewers .
channel 4 is more around the four million mark , and that is at its peak .
how is the british press reacting to this ?
i think in some ways it 's created quite a lot of interest .
i mean if you want publicity , channel 4 has done the right thing .
they 've had lots of publicity , even before the message was broadcast .
this was a big story on the bbc and most national newspapers covered it .
and of course with the paucity of news on christmas day , they got a lot of coverage .
so i expect there will be two or three days of a storm in a teacup , but i think it will probably be over by new year .

" my philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn english -lrb- barring spelling and pronouncing -rrb- in 30 hours , french in 30 days , and german in 30 years , " he wrote in a humorous essay titled " the awful german language " after a visit to imperial germany in the 1880s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " only the dead have time " to learn german , said humorist mark twain " it seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired , " he wrote , tongue firmyl in cheek .
" if it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it . "
german to become the official language ?
not that members of merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- paid any thought to twain 's caustic observations , made 120 years ago , at their recent party conference in stuttgart .
overwhelmingly , they approved a resolution - despite merkel 's reservations - calling on the german parliament to enshrine the german language in the constitution .
article 22 of the constitution already states that the nation 's capital shall be berlin , and the flag shall be black , red and gold , but hitherto has made no reference to the german language .
that will change if the cdu 's proposal wins approval in parliament and the sentence , " the language of the federal republic of germany shall be german , " is incorporated in the constitution .
popularity of german plummeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german constitution already enshrines the flag 's colors german has never been a very popular language , despite the efforts of its classic writers goethe and schiller .
its popularity plummeted after two world wars , but in the early 1990s german enjoyed a temporary renaissance after german reunification .
of the 20 million people learning german around the world , two-thirds of them were in eastern europe and the former republics of the soviet union .
in poland , the number of german students tripled from 500,000 in 1988 to 1.5 million by 1994 .
now , however , interest in learning german is down .
in britain , the number of students studying german has been on the wane for years .
a move against the turkish community ?
instrumental in the push to have german enshrined in the constitution is the fact that germany today is home to more than 3 million people of turkish descent .
overall the country has has more than 10 million immigrants , almost double the number found in britain .
in berlin 's large turkish community , many people who have been in germany for years or were even born in the country have difficulty speaking the local tongue .
german is a minority language on many school playgrounds in some districts .
this is a point taken up by peter mueller , the premier of the state of saarland , who speaks of the cdu needing to clarify " what the nation stands for . "
when people fail to speak german , the promise of social mobility is an empty one , he claimed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the debate renewed after cem odemir , head of the green party , proposed the teaching of turkish in schools cdu member annette heubinger agrees .
" it 's absolutely normal that the german language should be written into the constitution , " she says .
" learning and mastering a national language is the key to successful and sustainable integration . "
the cdu 's move to amend the constitution makes many uneasy , including immigrant groups , left-wing social democrats and members of the green party .
" this kind of thing is not necessary .
i do n't know what kind of signal they 're trying to send , " argues gerd pflaumer , a spokeman for the anti-discrimination group action courage .
aylin selcuk , a turkish community youth leader who has advised chancellor merkel , agrees that immigrants need to get ahead in life , but questions the cdu 's true motives in wanting german included in the constitution .
cem ozdemir , the new co-leader of the greens , called recently for the introduction of optional turkish-language courses in public schools - a proposal that outraged some conservatives .
ozdemir is of turkish descent but was born and educated in germany .
linguists alarmed by " denglish " the conservative party 's move , however , may also be aimed at guarding against the rapid spread of " denglish " - english words and phrases such as coffee to go , fast food , babysitting , breakfast , sixpack and let 's go , which have found their way into the german language in recent years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " denglish " words pop up all over the country herr and frau deutsch round up " die kids " to catch an intercity train at the station , after having found information on schedules at a service point desk .
some linguists are alarmed .
" will we all be speaking denglish soon , or will it be germeng ? " wrote professor rudolf hoberg in an anthology of essays on the state of the german language at the turn of the century .
officials at the goethe institute , which promotes the german language abroad , say there is always an on-going enrichment of the language , which involves absorbing words from several languages , including english , latin and also turkish .
but they say things get ugly in everyday language use when foreign words get shoved into a german sentence , or vice versa .
" we are not language purists at the goethe institute , but we do have respect for the english language , as well as our own , " said a goethe institute official .
" the language gets polluted when foreign words are popped for no reason into german sentences , simply because they are considered ' attractive , trendy or cool . " '
popular new york born entertainer gayle tufts , who has made her home in berlin , delights in teasing german audiences with her own strange mix of german and english which she calls " dinglish , " rather than denglish .
in 1998 , she even wrote a book in dinglish called absolutely unterwegs -lrb- absolutely on the road -rrb- , increasing her popularity still further among " the krauts . "
tufts whimsically insists her dinglish was an invention of necessity as she could not wait to learn the grammar . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two decades later berlin is planning a monument to commemorate the event . the german government has announced that in honor of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , next november it will release the results of an architecture competition to design a memorial commemorating german unification .
speaking with ap news agency , minister of culture bernd neumann said that construction on the memorial will start in 2010 and should be complete by 2012 .
berlin has set aside 15 million euros -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- for the project .
the architects should pay special attention to their entries , said neumann , because the memorial should n't just remind people of the wall and reunification , but rather all “ positive occurrences in german history , starting with the freedom movements in the 19th century . ”
the christian democrat politician also announced that the position of the memorial has already been decided on .
it will stand in central berlin , near the berliner city palace -lrb- berliner schloss -rrb- on top of the 80 by 40-meter pedestal once occupied by a memorial to kaiser wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

current legislation prevents the mainlanders from working until at least two years after arriving .
they have to wait eight years before they are entitled to apply for permanent residence .
the rules for spouses of other nationalities are much more lenient , and many felt the changes are overdue .
under the proposed changes , mainland chinese spouses will be able to work within weeks of arriving , just like other foreign spouses .
they will be able to qualify for permanent residency and voting rights in six years , instead of eight .
they can also sponsor children from a previous marriage to come here .
criticism to the more than 250,000 chinese spouses in taiwan , the government 's plan to relax restrictions is long overdue .
the spouses , who share the same language and culture as taiwanese people , have argued that the rules are discriminatory .
they say they leave them dependent on their taiwanese spouse .
some suffer from domestic violence , but are afraid to get a divorce because they could be deported .
the rules were imposed during the long era of tense relations between china and taiwan , which is seen by beijing as a renegade province .
previous governments in taipei insisted the restrictions were necessary due to political tensions with china , fake marriages and the island 's inability to handle an influx of chinese immigrants .
a new government administration this year has built warmer ties with china .

current legislation prevents the mainlanders from working until at least two years after arriving .
they have to wait eight years before they are entitled to apply for permanent residence .
the rules for spouses of other nationalities are much more lenient , and many felt the changes are overdue .
under the proposed changes , mainland chinese spouses will be able to work within weeks of arriving , just like other foreign spouses .
they will be able to qualify for permanent residency and voting rights in six years , instead of eight .
they can also sponsor children from a previous marriage to come here .
criticism to the more than 250,000 chinese spouses in taiwan , the government 's plan to relax restrictions is long overdue .
the spouses , who share the same language and culture as taiwanese people , have argued that the rules are discriminatory .
they say they leave them dependent on their taiwanese spouse .
some suffer from domestic violence , but are afraid to get a divorce because they could be deported .
the rules were imposed during the long era of tense relations between china and taiwan , which is seen by beijing as a renegade province .
previous governments in taipei insisted the restrictions were necessary due to political tensions with china , fake marriages and the island 's inability to handle an influx of chinese immigrants .
a new government administration this year has built warmer ties with china .
however , the spouses argue the changes do not go far enough .
other foreign spouses only have to wait four years , not six , to gain permanent residence .

a collapse on sales , production levels cut and job losses the likes of which have not been seen since the demise of mg rover .
but 2008 had started so well .
jaguar land rover was bought by tata in march after several years of losses , jaguar was finally doing well with rising sales following the successful launch of its new xf model .
land rover had just celebrated its best year ever with sales , both here and abroad showing healthy increases .
demand for its vehicles in china were up a staggering 429 % .
the future of both companies was further boosted when it emerged that the indian conglomerate tata was in pole-position to acquire them from owner ford .
already suffering in america , it had decided that jaguar and land rover were surplus to requirements and had to be sold .
back to earth by march the deal was done .
tata had paid more than £ 1bn for the two companies and for many it was the best possible outcome .
there had been concerns that alternative bidders , in the shape of equity firms , might have asset-stripped and cut jobs .
the sale of jaguar and land rover brought a collective sigh of relief from not just the two companies ' workforce , but also from those who supplied parts for the cars .
the region 's components firms had already enjoyed a good year with strong order books .
the completion of the sale meant that looked set to continue .
lord mandelson said jaguar land rover has well-resourced owners however , the honeymoon did not last long .
the credit crunch and the resulting global downturn brought many back to earth with a bump .
in the car industry the first real signs that something was happening came in june when car sales went into decline .
but worse was to come .
by september car firms began talking about the introduction of short-time working and cutting shifts in an effort to match production levels to falling demand .
jaguar and land rover moved onto a four-day week and revealed plans to cut hundreds of jobs through voluntary redundancy .
december brought one of the biggest shocks so far when luxury sports car maker aston martin announced that " extraordinary market conditions " had forced it cut up to 600 jobs , almost a third of its workforce .
updated version it had been thought those who could afford expensive cars would not be affected by the downturn , but they were .
one bright spot during the year was the rebirth of longbridge as a location for making cars .
after the collapse of mg rover many thought cars would never be made there again .
but true to its word nanjing , the company that bought the rover assets and new partner shanghai automotive started producing an updated version of the old mgtf sports car .
as the year came to an end the situation showed no signs of improving .
jaguar and land rover moved onto a four-day week the business secretary lord mandelson faced a major dilemma .
he had already spent billions of pounds bailing out the banks - should he do the same for the car industry ?
and , despite its importance as a volume manufacturer , should the uk taxpayer support jaguar and land rover , when its indian owner tata was still profitable ?
speaking to the bbc , lord mandelson was keen to remind tata that the ball was firmly in its court .
jaguar land rover , he said , has owners who are well-resourced , who have the first responsibility for sustaining the companies .
new model the year ahead looks like it will be just as challenging as the year just gone for all those involved in the automotive industry .
hopefully there will be some good news .
land rover is expected to announce that its next model , the environmentally-friendly lrx , will go into production , probably in solihull .
jaguar too has another new model up its sleeve in the shape of the revamped xj , due for launch in late 2009 .
nobody really knows what the midlands automotive industry will look like in 12 months .
there is little doubt that there will be fewer people making cars and the parts that go into them .
by then , it is hoped , there will be signs of recovery , not just from the recession , but also new hope for an industry that has served the midlands so well in the past and hopefully will continue to do so well into the future .

speaking to the bbc , lord mandelson was keen to remind tata that the ball was firmly in its court .
jaguar land rover , he said , has owners who are well-resourced , who have the first responsibility for sustaining the companies .

there is little doubt that there will be fewer people making cars and the parts that go into them .

a collapse on sales , production levels cut and job losses the likes of which have not been seen since the demise of mg rover .
but 2008 had started so well .
jaguar land rover was bought by tata in march after several years of losses , jaguar was finally doing well with rising sales following the successful launch of its new xf model .
land rover had just celebrated its best year ever with sales , both here and abroad showing healthy increases .
demand for its vehicles in china were up a staggering 429 % .
the future of both companies was further boosted when it emerged that the indian conglomerate tata was in pole-position to acquire them from owner ford .
already suffering in america , it had decided that jaguar and land rover were surplus to requirements and had to be sold .
back to earth by march the deal was done .
tata had paid more than £ 1bn for the two companies and for many it was the best possible outcome .
there had been concerns that alternative bidders , in the shape of equity firms , might have asset-stripped and cut jobs .
the sale of jaguar and land rover brought a collective sigh of relief from not just the two companies ' workforce , but also from those who supplied parts for the cars .
the region 's components firms had already enjoyed a good year with strong order books .
the completion of the sale meant that looked set to continue .
lord mandelson said jaguar land rover has well-resourced owners however , the honeymoon did not last long .
the credit crunch and the resulting global downturn brought many back to earth with a bump .
in the car industry the first real signs that something was happening came in june when car sales went into decline .
but worse was to come .
by september car firms began talking about the introduction of short-time working and cutting shifts in an effort to match production levels to falling demand .
jaguar and land rover moved onto a four-day week and revealed plans to cut hundreds of jobs through voluntary redundancy .
