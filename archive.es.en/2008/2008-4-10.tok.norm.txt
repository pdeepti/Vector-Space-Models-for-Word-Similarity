meanwhile , germany 's first bank casualty was announced . " the leadership of our industry recognizes its own responsibility to restore confidence in the financial markets , solve the problems that have arisen and prevent those problems from recurring in the future , " said josef ackermann , ceo of germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , on wednesday , april 9 , in frankfurt . ackermann presented a reform proposal by the institute of international finance -lrb- iif -rrb- , a body of 375 international financial institutions that he heads .
the iif 's report was delivered shortly before the finance ministers of the group of seven industrial nations are due to discuss banking conduct and monitoring efforts on friday in washington . " we should n't count on regulating away the banks ' problems , " agreed manfred weber , managing director of the association of german banks . more transparency and accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said stronger state regulation is n't necessary the iif 's 98-point paper focused on strengthening risk management and improving transparency for complicated products by simplifying pricing systems and making more information available to customers . according to the report , short-term pay incentives for financial managers increased their willingness to take unnecessary risks - something that should be avoided in the future by developing a plan that links managers ' compensation to long-term success . international rating agencies , which have been generally criticized for underestimating risks , also came under fire in the paper .
the iif recommended that rating agencies revise their capital asset pricing models to make them more understandable to the customer . in an effort to enforce these reforms , ackermann , speaking on behalf of the iff , proposed a monitoring group to be put in place by the end of the year . " we are considering a group of approximately 10 to 20 highly respected experts and eminent leaders of finance who can combine their experience and knowledge to alert the industry to actual and potential vulnerabilities and market developments that pose systematic risks , " said ackermann . the iff is expected to deliver a detailed code of conduct for banks this summer . german bank goes under also on wednesday , germany 's first banking fatality tied to the financial crisis was announced .
the small german investment bank weserbank said that it had begun insolvency proceedings .
banking watchdog bafin said the closure had more to do with the bank 's new business model than with the financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : short-term incentives led financial managers to take unreasonable risks , said iif weserbank chief gerold lehmann saw it differently : " under normal circumstances , we never would have had to close the bank .
we are suffering from a loss of trust as a result of the financial crisis . " world-wide losses and write-downs have totaled more than $ 200 billion since the market crisis began in the united states late last year . light at the end of the tunnel german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in the thursday edition of the business daily handelsblatt that he was concerned that a similar financial crisis could happen again , but also warned against inflated pessimism . " that the market is plunging does n't mean that it will plunge forever , " said steinbrueck .
he added that the check and balance mechanisms do n't function properly if the risk of insolvency is so high that the state or emergency banks have to step in . nevertheless , europe is not experiencing a recession , said the finance minister .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .

tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .

it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .
mugabe , in that case , would be a " lame-duck president , " said tsvangirai .

" turkey should demonstrate to europe its interest in eu membership " and " show europe what europe has to gain from turkish membership , " jose manuel barroso told a news conference in brussels , ahead of his two-day visit to ankara starting on thursday , april 11 .
" i am bringing him the message of encouraging reforms , " he said of his meeting with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan .
" the eu can only accept a democratic turkey , a turkey where there is consensus on democratic values .
that is why we are concerned by recent developments , which are something -lsb- that is -rsb- not normal in a stable democratic country , " barroso said .
" europe can only accept a democratic turkey " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants turkey to prove its democratic credentials he was echoing eu concerns over an attempt by turkey 's chief prosecutor to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the moderate islamist party of prime minister erdogan , and bar the prime minister from politics for alleged islamist subversion .
" it is not normal that the party that was chosen by the majority of the turkish people is now under this kind of investigation , " barroso said .
barroso said he hoped the constitutional court would make a decision based on law , democracy and respect for eu standards .
" we are looking for a secular , democratic turkey .
you can not impose religion by force , you can not impose secularism by force , " he said .
many in turkey 's secular elite believe the akp is trying to undermine the separation of religion and the state .
recent legislation allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf is seen by many secularists as proof of the party 's hidden islamist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have been split over recent legislation on headscarves the ak party denies this and says the court case is politically motivated .
turkish foreign minister ali babacan said he expected common sense to prevail in the court case , which has caused months of political uncertainty .
" turkey is now an open country , an open society , an open economy .

you can not impose religion by force , you can not impose secularism by force , " he said .
many in turkey 's secular elite believe the akp is trying to undermine the separation of religion and the state .
recent legislation allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf is seen by many secularists as proof of the party 's hidden islamist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have been split over recent legislation on headscarves the ak party denies this and says the court case is politically motivated .
turkish foreign minister ali babacan said he expected common sense to prevail in the court case , which has caused months of political uncertainty .
" turkey is now an open country , an open society , an open economy .
in open countries , the public both at home and abroad can watch developments .
in open countries , common sense and rationality have always won , " babacan told reporters .
barroso calls for reversal of " turkishness " clause erdogan vowed on tuesday to speed up political reforms required to join the 27-nation european union after stalling for more than a year amid opposition from nationalist parties .
barroso also reiterated his call for turkey to revise its infamous article 301 , which makes it a crime to insult " turkishness . "
the law has been used to charge hundreds of intellectuals and journalists , including nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk .
the law was incompatible with " the values of freedom of expression that we have in europe , " barroso said .
a reversal of the law , he said , would have " a major impact in the way turkey is seen by europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .

while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .

barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .

barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .

meanwhile , germany 's first bank casualty was announced . " the leadership of our industry recognizes its own responsibility to restore confidence in the financial markets , solve the problems that have arisen and prevent those problems from recurring in the future , " said josef ackermann , ceo of germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , on wednesday , april 9 , in frankfurt . ackermann presented a reform proposal by the institute of international finance -lrb- iif -rrb- , a body of 375 international financial institutions that he heads .
the iif 's report was delivered shortly before the finance ministers of the group of seven industrial nations are due to discuss banking conduct and monitoring efforts on friday in washington . " we should n't count on regulating away the banks ' problems , " agreed manfred weber , managing director of the association of german banks . more transparency and accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said stronger state regulation is n't necessary the iif 's 98-point paper focused on strengthening risk management and improving transparency for complicated products by simplifying pricing systems and making more information available to customers . according to the report , short-term pay incentives for financial managers increased their willingness to take unnecessary risks - something that should be avoided in the future by developing a plan that links managers ' compensation to long-term success . international rating agencies , which have been generally criticized for underestimating risks , also came under fire in the paper .
the iif recommended that rating agencies revise their capital asset pricing models to make them more understandable to the customer . in an effort to enforce these reforms , ackermann , speaking on behalf of the iff , proposed a monitoring group to be put in place by the end of the year . " we are considering a group of approximately 10 to 20 highly respected experts and eminent leaders of finance who can combine their experience and knowledge to alert the industry to actual and potential vulnerabilities and market developments that pose systematic risks , " said ackermann . the iff is expected to deliver a detailed code of conduct for banks this summer . german bank goes under also on wednesday , germany 's first banking fatality tied to the financial crisis was announced .
the small german investment bank weserbank said that it had begun insolvency proceedings .
banking watchdog bafin said the closure had more to do with the bank 's new business model than with the financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : short-term incentives led financial managers to take unreasonable risks , said iif weserbank chief gerold lehmann saw it differently : " under normal circumstances , we never would have had to close the bank .
we are suffering from a loss of trust as a result of the financial crisis . " world-wide losses and write-downs have totaled more than $ 200 billion since the market crisis began in the united states late last year . light at the end of the tunnel german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in the thursday edition of the business daily handelsblatt that he was concerned that a similar financial crisis could happen again , but also warned against inflated pessimism . " that the market is plunging does n't mean that it will plunge forever , " said steinbrueck .
he added that the check and balance mechanisms do n't function properly if the risk of insolvency is so high that the state or emergency banks have to step in . nevertheless , europe is not experiencing a recession , said the finance minister .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .

while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .

that is why we are concerned by recent developments , which are something -lsb- that is -rsb- not normal in a stable democratic country , " barroso said .
" europe can only accept a democratic turkey " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants turkey to prove its democratic credentials he was echoing eu concerns over an attempt by turkey 's chief prosecutor to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the moderate islamist party of prime minister erdogan , and bar the prime minister from politics for alleged islamist subversion .
" it is not normal that the party that was chosen by the majority of the turkish people is now under this kind of investigation , " barroso said .
barroso said he hoped the constitutional court would make a decision based on law , democracy and respect for eu standards .
" we are looking for a secular , democratic turkey .
you can not impose religion by force , you can not impose secularism by force , " he said .
many in turkey 's secular elite believe the akp is trying to undermine the separation of religion and the state .
recent legislation allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf is seen by many secularists as proof of the party 's hidden islamist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have been split over recent legislation on headscarves the ak party denies this and says the court case is politically motivated .
turkish foreign minister ali babacan said he expected common sense to prevail in the court case , which has caused months of political uncertainty .
" turkey is now an open country , an open society , an open economy .
in open countries , the public both at home and abroad can watch developments .
in open countries , common sense and rationality have always won , " babacan told reporters .
barroso calls for reversal of " turkishness " clause erdogan vowed on tuesday to speed up political reforms required to join the 27-nation european union after stalling for more than a year amid opposition from nationalist parties .
barroso also reiterated his call for turkey to revise its infamous article 301 , which makes it a crime to insult " turkishness . "
the law has been used to charge hundreds of intellectuals and journalists , including nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk .
the law was incompatible with " the values of freedom of expression that we have in europe , " barroso said .
a reversal of the law , he said , would have " a major impact in the way turkey is seen by europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .
the barca captain will miss the semi-final first leg after picking up another yellow card for a nasty challenge on gerald asamoah .

8 , if china remains unwilling to engage in dialogue with the dalai lama . parliament appealed to eu states to consider not participating in the ceremonies , though thursday 's resolution is not binding for the bloc 's 27 members . european parliamentarians condemned the " brutal actions of chinese security forces against tibetan demonstrators " and appealed to the united nations to investigate the most recent cases of violence and unrest in tibet . ioc reminds china of its promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge said protests along the torch relay route have caused a " crisis " in light of china 's crackdown on protestors demonstrating for tibetan independence , ioc president jacques rogge on thursday urged china to respect its " moral engagement " to improve human rights .
he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .
he said the relay would continue on its 20-country journey as planned . the ioc chief also told the heads of 205 national olympic committees they should pass on the message to their athletes that " we will rebound from this current crisis . " china rebuts critique , defends policy the chinese government fired back that politics should be kept out of the olympics .

" the human rights situation in china today is better than ever before , " said the ambassador .
" before the founding of new china , the country was a semi-feudal , semi-colonial society and exposed to humiliation from abroad . " according to a report by human rights watchdog amnesty international , the human rights situation in china has considerably worsened in the run-up to the summer games . tibetan exiles have reported 150 deaths resulting from a crackdown last month by chinese military and security forces in response to freedom protests .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .

tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .
mugabe , in that case , would be a " lame-duck president , " said tsvangirai .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 10.04.2008 champions league semis a step too far for shaky schalke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : close but no semi : schalke 's players rue their missed chances after elimination schalke 04 , the last german team in the champions league , went to the nou camp in barcelona with their dreams of a semi-final place still alive .
despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .
the barca captain will miss the semi-final first leg after picking up another yellow card for a nasty challenge on gerald asamoah .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .

such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .

he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .
he said the relay would continue on its 20-country journey as planned . the ioc chief also told the heads of 205 national olympic committees they should pass on the message to their athletes that " we will rebound from this current crisis .

8 , if china remains unwilling to engage in dialogue with the dalai lama . parliament appealed to eu states to consider not participating in the ceremonies , though thursday 's resolution is not binding for the bloc 's 27 members . european parliamentarians condemned the " brutal actions of chinese security forces against tibetan demonstrators " and appealed to the united nations to investigate the most recent cases of violence and unrest in tibet . ioc reminds china of its promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge said protests along the torch relay route have caused a " crisis " in light of china 's crackdown on protestors demonstrating for tibetan independence , ioc president jacques rogge on thursday urged china to respect its " moral engagement " to improve human rights .
he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .
he said the relay would continue on its 20-country journey as planned . the ioc chief also told the heads of 205 national olympic committees they should pass on the message to their athletes that " we will rebound from this current crisis . " china rebuts critique , defends policy the chinese government fired back that politics should be kept out of the olympics . " i believe ioc officials support the beijing olympics " and hope they continue to " adhere to the olympic charter of not bringing in any irrelevant political factors , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters . china 's ambassador to germany , ma canrong , defended the state of human rights in his country , while attributing china 's poor international reputation to distorted media reports . " the human rights situation in china today is better than ever before , " said the ambassador .
" before the founding of new china , the country was a semi-feudal , semi-colonial society and exposed to humiliation from abroad . " according to a report by human rights watchdog amnesty international , the human rights situation in china has considerably worsened in the run-up to the summer games . tibetan exiles have reported 150 deaths resulting from a crackdown last month by chinese military and security forces in response to freedom protests .
chinese authorities have said that tibetan rioters killed 20 people and repeatedly blamed the dalai lama for the unrest . bildunterschrift : despite heavy protests along the route , olympic organizers have said the torch relay will continue as planned dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have written to germany about the ' volkswagen law ' , " the spokeswoman to eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said . the vw law was introduced in 1960 as volkswagen , founded by the nazi regime before world war ii , was being privatized , and was designed to shield the group from foreign takeover attempts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in wolfsburg , northern germany the crux of the law is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in a company . last year europe 's top court ruled against the vw law . " they have n't fully complied with the court judgment , the commission spokeswoman catherine bunyan said .
" the draft amendment under consideration does n't take into account the whole remarks of the court , " in particular on the 20 percent voting threshold , she said . keeping a part of it german justice minister brigitte zypries aims to retain a clause in the volkswagen law that requires 80 percent of shareholders to approve decisions , compared with the 75 percent most common among other companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw 's state of lower saxony does n't like the idea of a takeover of its beloved company that clause gives the german state of lower saxony , holding 20.3 percent of voting rights , a de-facto blocking minority . the eu commission spokeswoman said that an " ordinary letter " had been sent to the german justice ministry and was not the start of a formal infringement procedure , adding that there was no fixed deadline for germany to respond . the european court of justice had ruled that certain clauses of the so-called volkswagen law violated eu laws on free movement of capital . difference of opinion zypries reacted promptly to the letter with one of her own to express germany 's point of view . the text said germany saw in the october court ruling " no sufficiently explicit declaration " that supported the eu 's position . zypries argued that the minority blocking stake did " not limit the free movement of capital . " a ministry spokesman told afp : " we are now awaiting the commission 's reaction .
we hope we have convinced them . " porsche , which currently owns 31 percent of vw shares and plans to raise its stake to more than 50 percent at an unspecified date , has urged the german government to scrap the vw law altogether , after officials said they were working on a new draft that would pass eu muster . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .

" we have written to germany about the ' volkswagen law ' , " the spokeswoman to eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy said . the vw law was introduced in 1960 as volkswagen , founded by the nazi regime before world war ii , was being privatized , and was designed to shield the group from foreign takeover attempts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production line in wolfsburg , northern germany the crux of the law is that regardless of the amount of capital it owns , a shareholder can not hold more than 20 percent of the voting rights in a company . last year europe 's top court ruled against the vw law .

" a ministry spokesman told afp : " we are now awaiting the commission 's reaction .
we hope we have convinced them .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .
the barca captain will miss the semi-final first leg after picking up another yellow card for a nasty challenge on gerald asamoah .
germany looks to uefa cup for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmin contra 's goal gave getafe a vital lift in munich german hopes of european glory now hinge on bayern munich 's uefa cup campaign .
but it hangs in the balance after a spirited getafe side came away from the allianz arena with a valuable away goal in the 1-1 first-leg draw last week .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .
mugabe , in that case , would be a " lame-duck president , " said tsvangirai .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .

" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "

he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis .

the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .
he said the relay would continue on its 20-country journey as planned . the ioc chief also told the heads of 205 national olympic committees they should pass on the message to their athletes that " we will rebound from this current crisis .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .
mugabe , in that case , would be a " lame-duck president , " said tsvangirai .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .

tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .

" turkey should demonstrate to europe its interest in eu membership " and " show europe what europe has to gain from turkish membership , " jose manuel barroso told a news conference in brussels , ahead of his two-day visit to ankara starting on thursday , april 11 .
" i am bringing him the message of encouraging reforms , " he said of his meeting with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan .
" the eu can only accept a democratic turkey , a turkey where there is consensus on democratic values .
that is why we are concerned by recent developments , which are something -lsb- that is -rsb- not normal in a stable democratic country , " barroso said .
" europe can only accept a democratic turkey " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants turkey to prove its democratic credentials he was echoing eu concerns over an attempt by turkey 's chief prosecutor to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the moderate islamist party of prime minister erdogan , and bar the prime minister from politics for alleged islamist subversion .
" it is not normal that the party that was chosen by the majority of the turkish people is now under this kind of investigation , " barroso said .
barroso said he hoped the constitutional court would make a decision based on law , democracy and respect for eu standards .
" we are looking for a secular , democratic turkey .
you can not impose religion by force , you can not impose secularism by force , " he said .
many in turkey 's secular elite believe the akp is trying to undermine the separation of religion and the state .
recent legislation allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf is seen by many secularists as proof of the party 's hidden islamist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have been split over recent legislation on headscarves the ak party denies this and says the court case is politically motivated .
turkish foreign minister ali babacan said he expected common sense to prevail in the court case , which has caused months of political uncertainty .
" turkey is now an open country , an open society , an open economy .
in open countries , the public both at home and abroad can watch developments .
in open countries , common sense and rationality have always won , " babacan told reporters .
barroso calls for reversal of " turkishness " clause erdogan vowed on tuesday to speed up political reforms required to join the 27-nation european union after stalling for more than a year amid opposition from nationalist parties .
barroso also reiterated his call for turkey to revise its infamous article 301 , which makes it a crime to insult " turkishness . "
the law has been used to charge hundreds of intellectuals and journalists , including nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk .
the law was incompatible with " the values of freedom of expression that we have in europe , " barroso said .
a reversal of the law , he said , would have " a major impact in the way turkey is seen by europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 10.04.2008 champions league semis a step too far for shaky schalke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : close but no semi : schalke 's players rue their missed chances after elimination schalke 04 , the last german team in the champions league , went to the nou camp in barcelona with their dreams of a semi-final place still alive .
despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .
the barca captain will miss the semi-final first leg after picking up another yellow card for a nasty challenge on gerald asamoah .
germany looks to uefa cup for success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cosmin contra 's goal gave getafe a vital lift in munich german hopes of european glory now hinge on bayern munich 's uefa cup campaign .
but it hangs in the balance after a spirited getafe side came away from the allianz arena with a valuable away goal in the 1-1 first-leg draw last week .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .
mugabe , in that case , would be a " lame-duck president , " said tsvangirai .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .
mugabe , in that case , would be a " lame-duck president , " said tsvangirai .

barroso said he hoped the constitutional court would make a decision based on law , democracy and respect for eu standards .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mdc wants a resolution to the poll uncertainty speaking to south african radio from botswana where he held talks with president seretse ian khama , tsvangirai said that , once zimbabwe 's election standoff was resolved , " we must move towards forming a government that has space for everyone . "
such a government would be a " more inclusive government that is not exclusive to just mdc , " he said .
asked what role 84-year-old mugabe would have in such a formation tsvangirai , 56 , said that " would be subject to discussion , " but that he thought zimbabwe 's leader of the past 28 years should retire .
tsvangirai is on a tour of african countries to court support for his declaration of victory over mugabe in march 29 elections .
on monday he met with the president of south africa 's ruling african national congress , jacob zuma .
mdc leader rules out new mugabe presidency tsvangirai claims he won outright with 50.3 percent of the vote , but a non-profit election observation organization estimated that , based on a sample of the results , neither he nor mugabe took more than the 50 percent-plus-one vote needed to avert a second round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it may be time for mugabe to step down after 28 years mugabe 's zanu-pf party is demanding a recount of the vote and is also challenging its defeat in elections to the 210-seat lower house of parliament , the house of assembly .
tsvangirai rejected a scenario where mugabe would remain president and the opposition , which won 109 of the 210-seats in the house of assembly , would control parliament .
mugabe , in that case , would be a " lame-duck president , " said tsvangirai .

tsvangirai , the leader of zimbabwe 's movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , has announced that should he be elected head of state , healing the country 's broken financial institutions would be one of his first objectives - with the help of experts from germany 's bundesbank .
tsvangirai 's statement , first reported by zimbabwe 's herald newspaper and later confirmed through diplomatic sources , includes a desire to employ two employees of the german central bank as advisors to zimbabwe 's state bank in one of his first acts as president .
the german advisors would be given wide-ranging power and authority to complete their main task of stopping inflation getting further out-of-control and eventually reducing it to a much lower sustainable level .
government mouthpiece latches on to german plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai is the target of an alleged smear campaign the herald , a mouthpiece of robert mugabe 's regime , has used the statement from the incumbent president 's most likely successor to further extend a campaign painting tsvangirai as " a puppet of the white man . "
it is suspected that the initial reports of tsvangirai 's plan to hire german financial advisors were collected from tapped telephone conversations .
tsvangirai has been portrayed as the " odd-job man " of the past british colonial powers in zimbabwe who wants to hand control of farm land and territory back into " the claws " of the former white colonists who controlled the country before it was given its independence in 1980 .
mugabe has used the defense of zimbabwe against the colonists as one of the main pillars of his presidency since he took charge of the country 28 years ago .
his regime has carried out repatriation of colonial farmland as well as the expulsion of white farmers .
it now appears that his potential last throw of the political dice will also hinge on labeling his rival a traitor to zimbabwe 's independence .
while the official results of the presidential vote have yet to be announced nearly two weeks after it took place , tsvangirai is widely expected to be named the new president if the results are released .
zimbabwe is in a state of limbo as tsvangirai campaigns for a swift resolution to the political stasis .
opposition floats unity government idea the mdc leader indicated on wednesday , april 9 , that he was open to the formation of a unity government with elements of mugabe 's zanu-pf party .

he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .
he said the relay would continue on its 20-country journey as planned . the ioc chief also told the heads of 205 national olympic committees they should pass on the message to their athletes that " we will rebound from this current crisis . " china rebuts critique , defends policy the chinese government fired back that politics should be kept out of the olympics .

" the human rights situation in china today is better than ever before , " said the ambassador .
" before the founding of new china , the country was a semi-feudal , semi-colonial society and exposed to humiliation from abroad . " according to a report by human rights watchdog amnesty international , the human rights situation in china has considerably worsened in the run-up to the summer games . tibetan exiles have reported 150 deaths resulting from a crackdown last month by chinese military and security forces in response to freedom protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 10.04.2008 champions league semis a step too far for shaky schalke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : close but no semi : schalke 's players rue their missed chances after elimination schalke 04 , the last german team in the champions league , went to the nou camp in barcelona with their dreams of a semi-final place still alive .
despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .
the barca captain will miss the semi-final first leg after picking up another yellow card for a nasty challenge on gerald asamoah .

he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .

" turkey should demonstrate to europe its interest in eu membership " and " show europe what europe has to gain from turkish membership , " jose manuel barroso told a news conference in brussels , ahead of his two-day visit to ankara starting on thursday , april 11 .
" i am bringing him the message of encouraging reforms , " he said of his meeting with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan .
" the eu can only accept a democratic turkey , a turkey where there is consensus on democratic values .
that is why we are concerned by recent developments , which are something -lsb- that is -rsb- not normal in a stable democratic country , " barroso said .
" europe can only accept a democratic turkey " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso wants turkey to prove its democratic credentials he was echoing eu concerns over an attempt by turkey 's chief prosecutor to ban the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the moderate islamist party of prime minister erdogan , and bar the prime minister from politics for alleged islamist subversion .
" it is not normal that the party that was chosen by the majority of the turkish people is now under this kind of investigation , " barroso said .
barroso said he hoped the constitutional court would make a decision based on law , democracy and respect for eu standards .
" we are looking for a secular , democratic turkey .
you can not impose religion by force , you can not impose secularism by force , " he said .
many in turkey 's secular elite believe the akp is trying to undermine the separation of religion and the state .
recent legislation allowing university students to wear the islamic headscarf is seen by many secularists as proof of the party 's hidden islamist agenda .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks have been split over recent legislation on headscarves the ak party denies this and says the court case is politically motivated .
turkish foreign minister ali babacan said he expected common sense to prevail in the court case , which has caused months of political uncertainty .
" turkey is now an open country , an open society , an open economy .
in open countries , the public both at home and abroad can watch developments .
in open countries , common sense and rationality have always won , " babacan told reporters .
barroso calls for reversal of " turkishness " clause erdogan vowed on tuesday to speed up political reforms required to join the 27-nation european union after stalling for more than a year amid opposition from nationalist parties .
barroso also reiterated his call for turkey to revise its infamous article 301 , which makes it a crime to insult " turkishness . "
the law has been used to charge hundreds of intellectuals and journalists , including nobel literature laureate orhan pamuk .
the law was incompatible with " the values of freedom of expression that we have in europe , " barroso said .
a reversal of the law , he said , would have " a major impact in the way turkey is seen by europe . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .

" the human rights situation in china today is better than ever before , " said the ambassador .
" before the founding of new china , the country was a semi-feudal , semi-colonial society and exposed to humiliation from abroad . " according to a report by human rights watchdog amnesty international , the human rights situation in china has considerably worsened in the run-up to the summer games . tibetan exiles have reported 150 deaths resulting from a crackdown last month by chinese military and security forces in response to freedom protests .

8 , if china remains unwilling to engage in dialogue with the dalai lama . parliament appealed to eu states to consider not participating in the ceremonies , though thursday 's resolution is not binding for the bloc 's 27 members . european parliamentarians condemned the " brutal actions of chinese security forces against tibetan demonstrators " and appealed to the united nations to investigate the most recent cases of violence and unrest in tibet . ioc reminds china of its promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge said protests along the torch relay route have caused a " crisis " in light of china 's crackdown on protestors demonstrating for tibetan independence , ioc president jacques rogge on thursday urged china to respect its " moral engagement " to improve human rights .
he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .
he said the relay would continue on its 20-country journey as planned . the ioc chief also told the heads of 205 national olympic committees they should pass on the message to their athletes that " we will rebound from this current crisis . " china rebuts critique , defends policy the chinese government fired back that politics should be kept out of the olympics . " i believe ioc officials support the beijing olympics " and hope they continue to " adhere to the olympic charter of not bringing in any irrelevant political factors , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters . china 's ambassador to germany , ma canrong , defended the state of human rights in his country , while attributing china 's poor international reputation to distorted media reports . " the human rights situation in china today is better than ever before , " said the ambassador .
" before the founding of new china , the country was a semi-feudal , semi-colonial society and exposed to humiliation from abroad . " according to a report by human rights watchdog amnesty international , the human rights situation in china has considerably worsened in the run-up to the summer games . tibetan exiles have reported 150 deaths resulting from a crackdown last month by chinese military and security forces in response to freedom protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 10.04.2008 champions league semis a step too far for shaky schalke großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : close but no semi : schalke 's players rue their missed chances after elimination schalke 04 , the last german team in the champions league , went to the nou camp in barcelona with their dreams of a semi-final place still alive .
despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .
the barca captain will miss the semi-final first leg after picking up another yellow card for a nasty challenge on gerald asamoah .

meanwhile , germany 's first bank casualty was announced . " the leadership of our industry recognizes its own responsibility to restore confidence in the financial markets , solve the problems that have arisen and prevent those problems from recurring in the future , " said josef ackermann , ceo of germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , on wednesday , april 9 , in frankfurt . ackermann presented a reform proposal by the institute of international finance -lrb- iif -rrb- , a body of 375 international financial institutions that he heads .
the iif 's report was delivered shortly before the finance ministers of the group of seven industrial nations are due to discuss banking conduct and monitoring efforts on friday in washington .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .
the barca captain will miss the semi-final first leg after picking up another yellow card for a nasty challenge on gerald asamoah .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .
" when the goal is scored it is too late to talk about it , " he said .
" we are a team , we win as a team and we lose as a team . "
under-fire barca coach bullish over man utd clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca 's fans have been on the team 's back recently the victory eases some of the pressure building on embattled barca coach rijkaard and the club 's under-fire president joan laporta .
" after the first leg result , they had nothing to lose and were out to spring a surprise , " said rijkaard of schalke .
" they were playing well and i think that made us a bit nervous as we tried to wrap things up .
however , my team put in a lot of effort and we deserve to be in the semi-finals .
it 'll be two matches at a very high level , and i would n't make manchester united the favorites . "
barca could welcome back south american maestros lionel messi , ronaldinho and deco for the semi-final .
defender gabi milito may also be fit enough to return from injury - and his presence will be needed to shore up a defense which will be without carlos puyol .

meanwhile , germany 's first bank casualty was announced . " the leadership of our industry recognizes its own responsibility to restore confidence in the financial markets , solve the problems that have arisen and prevent those problems from recurring in the future , " said josef ackermann , ceo of germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , on wednesday , april 9 , in frankfurt . ackermann presented a reform proposal by the institute of international finance -lrb- iif -rrb- , a body of 375 international financial institutions that he heads .
the iif 's report was delivered shortly before the finance ministers of the group of seven industrial nations are due to discuss banking conduct and monitoring efforts on friday in washington . " we should n't count on regulating away the banks ' problems , " agreed manfred weber , managing director of the association of german banks . more transparency and accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann said stronger state regulation is n't necessary the iif 's 98-point paper focused on strengthening risk management and improving transparency for complicated products by simplifying pricing systems and making more information available to customers . according to the report , short-term pay incentives for financial managers increased their willingness to take unnecessary risks - something that should be avoided in the future by developing a plan that links managers ' compensation to long-term success . international rating agencies , which have been generally criticized for underestimating risks , also came under fire in the paper .
the iif recommended that rating agencies revise their capital asset pricing models to make them more understandable to the customer . in an effort to enforce these reforms , ackermann , speaking on behalf of the iff , proposed a monitoring group to be put in place by the end of the year . " we are considering a group of approximately 10 to 20 highly respected experts and eminent leaders of finance who can combine their experience and knowledge to alert the industry to actual and potential vulnerabilities and market developments that pose systematic risks , " said ackermann . the iff is expected to deliver a detailed code of conduct for banks this summer . german bank goes under also on wednesday , germany 's first banking fatality tied to the financial crisis was announced .
the small german investment bank weserbank said that it had begun insolvency proceedings .
banking watchdog bafin said the closure had more to do with the bank 's new business model than with the financial crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : short-term incentives led financial managers to take unreasonable risks , said iif weserbank chief gerold lehmann saw it differently : " under normal circumstances , we never would have had to close the bank .
we are suffering from a loss of trust as a result of the financial crisis . " world-wide losses and write-downs have totaled more than $ 200 billion since the market crisis began in the united states late last year . light at the end of the tunnel german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in the thursday edition of the business daily handelsblatt that he was concerned that a similar financial crisis could happen again , but also warned against inflated pessimism . " that the market is plunging does n't mean that it will plunge forever , " said steinbrueck .
he added that the check and balance mechanisms do n't function properly if the risk of insolvency is so high that the state or emergency banks have to step in . nevertheless , europe is not experiencing a recession , said the finance minister .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .
such was the dearth in quality from the home side , it could well have been mirko slomka 's bundesliga outfit preparing to take on the english premier league leaders for a place in the final rather than the barcelonistes .
however , it takes a terrible team to lose against a bad one , and while schalke created a myriad of chances to put the tie beyond barca , woeful finishing and vanishing confidence put paid to schalke 's best-ever chance to reach the end game of europe 's top club competition .
out-of-form kuranyi fluffs lines again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barca skipper puyol had kuranyi in check for long periods despite months of inexplicably lost form , schalke started with the misfiring kevin kuranyi back in the side , and he squandered no less than four good chances in the first 20 minutes .
while the spirit was strong and the body willing , the germany striker and his teammates continued to lack the killer touch which had allowed barcelona to come away from the veltins arena with a scrappy 1-0 win in this quarter-final 's first leg last week .
in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .
teenager bojan krkic centered from the right , schalke defender marcelo bordon badly sliced his clearance , teammate mladen krstajic headed the ball off the line - but only for yaya toure to follow up and score with a left-foot volley .
both sides guilty of profligacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comedy defending ended with yaya toure volleying home the bizarre goal gave barca the confidence they had lacked in the first half , but after the break , matters soon followed in a similar fashion with both sides missing gilt-edged chances .
barca strikers samuel eto 'o and thierry henry miss-hit almost every ball that came their way while halil altintop and kuranyi were equally inept for schalke .
even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .
" we pressed hard and we created opportunities , but in the end we could n't do much with them , " conceded schalke coach slomka .
" we are disappointed that we have gone out , " added schalke goalkeeper neuer .
" we were just not lucky on the day and they had the luck that we were missing .
we tried everything going forward but just missed using our chances . "
neuer refused to blame his team 's calamitous defending for the goal that effectively knocked schalke out .

despite another poor show by their hosts , schalke failed to capitalize . barcelona , currently a shadow of the team that swept all before them in la liga and the champions league in 2006 , scraped past a profligate schalke team in the catalan capital on wednesday , april 9 , to set up a semi-final clash with manchester united which promises to present frank rijkaard 's team with a much sterner test .

in contrast , barca midfielder xavi hernandez forced a sharp save from manuel neuer after just 12 minutes , after being exquisitely put through by andres iniesta .
barca always looked more dangerous and it was little surprise when they took the lead in the 43rd minute , thanks to a veritable comedy of errors in the german defense .

even with barcelona starting to look nervous - with only one win in their last seven outings and a slender lead against dogged if chaotic opponents - schalke could still not get the goal which would have changed the complexion not only of the game but the whole tie .

8 , if china remains unwilling to engage in dialogue with the dalai lama . parliament appealed to eu states to consider not participating in the ceremonies , though thursday 's resolution is not binding for the bloc 's 27 members . european parliamentarians condemned the " brutal actions of chinese security forces against tibetan demonstrators " and appealed to the united nations to investigate the most recent cases of violence and unrest in tibet . ioc reminds china of its promises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rogge said protests along the torch relay route have caused a " crisis " in light of china 's crackdown on protestors demonstrating for tibetan independence , ioc president jacques rogge on thursday urged china to respect its " moral engagement " to improve human rights .
he also called on the host country to fulfill the promises it had made in its olympic bid to advance human rights and promote greater press freedom . speaking after a meeting with chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing , rogge said that weeks of protest surrounding the ongoing olympic torch relay had thrown the games into " crisis . " demonstrators protesting china 's treatment of tibet have followed the torch since it was lit in greece on march 24 .
the relay was disrupted so severely by protestors in paris that the torch had to be extinguished several times . rogge expressed relief that the relay went more smoothly in san francisco this week , where organizers shortened its course and made a last-minute route change to circumvent protestors .
he said the relay would continue on its 20-country journey as planned . the ioc chief also told the heads of 205 national olympic committees they should pass on the message to their athletes that " we will rebound from this current crisis . " china rebuts critique , defends policy the chinese government fired back that politics should be kept out of the olympics . " i believe ioc officials support the beijing olympics " and hope they continue to " adhere to the olympic charter of not bringing in any irrelevant political factors , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters . china 's ambassador to germany , ma canrong , defended the state of human rights in his country , while attributing china 's poor international reputation to distorted media reports . " the human rights situation in china today is better than ever before , " said the ambassador .
" before the founding of new china , the country was a semi-feudal , semi-colonial society and exposed to humiliation from abroad . " according to a report by human rights watchdog amnesty international , the human rights situation in china has considerably worsened in the run-up to the summer games . tibetan exiles have reported 150 deaths resulting from a crackdown last month by chinese military and security forces in response to freedom protests .

it relies heavily on the local populace to help its bid to block the " main routes of incursion " from the south .
red alert south west scotland is at the frontline of stopping grey squirrels getting into a red squirrel stronghold .
and in the woodlands throughout its area it has now established a total of 13 safe havens .
the south of scotland is one of a small number of areas in the uk where the reds still thrive .
they are under constant threat , however , from their grey counterparts which compete with them for food .
the grey squirrels also carry the squirrel pox virus which has no effect on them but is fatal for the reds .
red alert has been a busy organisation since it was set up some seven years ago .
at this time squirrel pox presents a very localised threat but , without direct action , could rapidly spread throughout scotland rhiannon hatfield red alert south west scotland red squirrel dies from deadly pox its main aim is to raise awareness of conservation issues surrounding the animals and also highlight the impact of habitat loss and disease .
" one of red alert 's particular concerns is the increasing number of grey squirrels arriving in dumfries and galloway , " explained rhiannon hatfield , from the organisation .
" not only do these squirrels compete aggressively for food but many of those entering the region from cumbria carry with them a pox virus that results in very rapid death of the red squirrels into which they come into contact .
" an outbreak of the disease in a population of red squirrels near lockerbie last year resulted in a number of deaths . "
it is for that reason that red alert distributes traps to people who are willing to help - after appropriate training - with the " humane control " of grey squirrels .
two full-time grey squirrel control officers are also employed by scottish natural heritage to cover the nith , annan and esk river valleys .

they have killed about 650 squirrels over an 18-month period .
these animals then form the basis of monitoring for squirrel pox in the area .
" at this time squirrel pox presents a very localised threat but , without direct action , could rapidly spread throughout scotland , " ms hatfield said .
" the majority of the traps red alert has out on loan are located in annandale , eskdale and nithsdale , these being the main routes of incursion and subsequent spread .
" in the past year this voluntary effort has results in close to 130 pioneer grey squirrels being prevented from establishing in dumfries and galloway . "
a spokeswoman for the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said that , on occasions , such action may be necessary .
" while we are opposed to the unnecessary killing of any wild animal we do recognise that in certain situations populations need to be controlled , " she said .
" if conservationists deem this to be the case we would expect any cull to be subject to high animal welfare standards . "
population monitored advocates for animals , however , has described the practice as " morally wrong " .
a series of " priority woodlands " have now been established in dumfries and galloway to provide safe havens for red squirrels .
working along with forest owners , red alert hopes to keep grey squirrels at bay for some time to come .
" this will ensure that the habitat remains favourable for red squirrels for many years to come , " ms hatfield said .
" to assess the effectiveness of these measures , red squirrel populations are monitored each year . "
so far , the population seems to be holding steady against the potential invasion of the greys .
but red alert , as its name suggest , will not be letting its guard down any time soon .

" one of red alert 's particular concerns is the increasing number of grey squirrels arriving in dumfries and galloway , " explained rhiannon hatfield , from the organisation .
" not only do these squirrels compete aggressively for food but many of those entering the region from cumbria carry with them a pox virus that results in very rapid death of the red squirrels into which they come into contact .
" an outbreak of the disease in a population of red squirrels near lockerbie last year resulted in a number of deaths . "
it is for that reason that red alert distributes traps to people who are willing to help - after appropriate training - with the " humane control " of grey squirrels .
two full-time grey squirrel control officers are also employed by scottish natural heritage to cover the nith , annan and esk river valleys .
what is squirrel pox ?
they have killed about 650 squirrels over an 18-month period .
these animals then form the basis of monitoring for squirrel pox in the area .
" at this time squirrel pox presents a very localised threat but , without direct action , could rapidly spread throughout scotland , " ms hatfield said .
" the majority of the traps red alert has out on loan are located in annandale , eskdale and nithsdale , these being the main routes of incursion and subsequent spread .
" in the past year this voluntary effort has results in close to 130 pioneer grey squirrels being prevented from establishing in dumfries and galloway . "
a spokeswoman for the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said that , on occasions , such action may be necessary .
" while we are opposed to the unnecessary killing of any wild animal we do recognise that in certain situations populations need to be controlled , " she said .
" if conservationists deem this to be the case we would expect any cull to be subject to high animal welfare standards . "
population monitored advocates for animals , however , has described the practice as " morally wrong " .
a series of " priority woodlands " have now been established in dumfries and galloway to provide safe havens for red squirrels .
working along with forest owners , red alert hopes to keep grey squirrels at bay for some time to come .
" this will ensure that the habitat remains favourable for red squirrels for many years to come , " ms hatfield said .
" to assess the effectiveness of these measures , red squirrel populations are monitored each year . "
so far , the population seems to be holding steady against the potential invasion of the greys .
but red alert , as its name suggest , will not be letting its guard down any time soon .

energywatch wales said it was concerned that 270,000 households were classed as " fuel poor , " up from 130,000 in 2004 .
factors including low income , rising prices , higher supplier costs and prepayment meters all contributed to the size of the bills .
the welsh assembly government , which will hear the report later , said it was committed to eradicating fuel poverty . "
it 's actually getting to the stage now where it is critical " wendy davies , energywatch wales six energy companies will also give evidence to the assembly 's sustainability committee on thursday .
energywatch wales compared the prices of electricity bills in wales and england and found that , on average , south wales customers paid 10 % more and north wales customers 4 % extra .
average energy prices have risen by 15 % since january , which energywatch believes has taken approximately 12.5 % of welsh households into " fuel poverty " .
wendy davies , the director of energywatch wales , said : " there are three factors which actually come into play when you look at fuel poverty - they are the energy efficiency of the dwelling , the actual cost of the fuel and low incomes .
" so those three elements we need to be tackling in different ways but what has n't helped at all is the fact that prices have increased so much over the last four years - and it 's actually getting to the stage now where it is critical . "
she added : " the average energy bill in wales now is over £ 1,000 a year . "
energy companies taking part centrica e-on uk scottish and southern energy scottish power rwe npower edf energy a household in fuel poverty is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 % of its income to keep the home warm enough : 21c in the main living room , 18c in other occupied rooms .
the committee has said it is " deeply concerned about the impact of increasing fuel prices on welsh customers and on efforts to tackle fuel poverty " .
committee chair mick bates said : " fuel poverty and the impact of increasing fuel prices mean that there are many people cold this winter . "
sue beck , 61 , from barry , vale of glamorgan , does not consider herself to be in fuel poverty yet , but is concerned that she is in a precarious position at the start of her retirement , and thinks it can only get worse .
rising energy prices , combined with council tax and food price increases , have alarmed her .
the family are on a meter , and pay £ 20 a week for electricity and gas , but she has noticed they get less time on the cards , and she is now worried about turning on the heating .
" through the worst months of the year , it can be £ 100 a month , " she said .
" i think our welsh assembly has got an ideal opportunity to take a lead .
i 'd like to see all this money which is given to winter warmth payment put to better use . "
the assembly government has a target of eradicating fuel poverty in vulnerable households by 2010. energywatch is suggesting a number of points to improve the situation , including : suppliers to revisit their pricing policy possible amendments to network charging policies realistic action plan to tackle fuel poverty encourage suppliers to look for a better deal suppliers to provide " proper " social tariffs " helen northmore , head of energy saving trust wales , advised people to shop around for the best deals , save energy through measures such as turning off unwanted lights , and insulate their homes .

sometimes , a quirky haircut , the right dose of column inches and a mediocre song are enough to guarantee success .
at others , a lovingly crafted album can stall despite a top 10 single , positive reviews and a tour supporting justin timberlake .
that was the situation natasha bedingfield found herself in last summer when her second release , nb , dropped gracelessly out of the charts .
so when she left the uk to promote the album in the us , something needed to change .
and what changed was the album itself .
all but six of nb 's quirky girlpop anthems were jettisoned in favour of a bunch of new , r & b-flavoured songs .
it proved a successful tactic .
pocket full of sunshine , as the album was re-christened , shot to number three in its first week on the charts , selling more than 50,000 copies .
i feel disappointed when i listen to music and it brings you down and feeds bitterness and anger natasha bedingfield but bedingfield says her us record label never put any pressure on her to revamp the album .
" it was n't a case of ' you have to record new stuff , " ' she says .
" all last summer i was on tour with justin timberlake and wherever i could , i would try to write .
" by the time i came to releasing the album in the states , i had a lot of new songs i wanted to put on there .
i did n't want to be stuck performing stuff from the year before . "
there is no doubting the ambition of the 26-year-old bedingfield .
last year , she told the bbc it was her " big goal to be a global artist " and that america was " the final push " .
and , as pocket full of sunshine racked up sales in the us , she scrapped a uk tour , explaining that her us label " insisted " she remained stateside .
the star 's mother runs the children 's charity global angels while there , she has been able to observe the seemingly endless presidential race , where barack obama has been using her single unwritten in his campaign .
" did they approach me ?
no , i think they just used it , " she says .
" but i was very excited because i think he 's very inspiring .
" a lot of people who do n't normally vote have come out of hiding because of this guy who 's bringing back hope . "
bedingfield 's uplifting pop fitted in well with the democratic hopeful 's campaign .
raised as a christian , there is often a spiritual edge to her music , where the lyrics - while dealing with self-doubt and failed relationships - always contain a spark of hope .
" i feel disappointed when i listen to music and it brings you down and feeds bitterness and anger , " she says .
" i 'm a glass half full person .
i 'm honest about where i 'm at , but i like to look out for a way out as well .
no wallowing in self pity ! "
hidden art not that bedingfield has the time to indulge in much soul searching these days .
her promotional schedule is so hectic that she can barely remember coming back to the uk to spend valentine 's day with her boyfriend .
" i do n't remember ...
i was n't in london for valentine 's , was i ?
oh wait !
yes , i was !
" my boyfriend cooked me dinner - a salmon , which was delicious .
the singer performed at last year 's concert for diana " i know it sounds like a very ordinary thing , but it was very special for us because we 're always in hotels ! "
hotel life has its advantages for a restless soul like bedingfield - " i 'm never there long enough to get bored " - and she has discovered a hidden world of art in the motels of america .
" there 's a whole bunch of people that do hidden graffiti in hotel rooms , " she enthuses .
" they take a picture away from a wall and draw something behind it , then they put it back so no-one in the hotel knows .
" it 's like this underground art scene for business people .
they 're very serious in their lives , but they have a rebellious side - kind of like fight club .
" have i ever been tempted ?
oh yeah ... but i 'd probably run out of time to finish it . "
with pocket full of sunshine due for release in the uk this summer , bedingfield is guaranteed to have more opportunities to become a bedroom banksy .
perhaps she should strike while the iron is hot .
pop can be a tricky business , after all .
natasha bedingfield 's new single , love like this , is out in the uk now .

sometimes , a quirky haircut , the right dose of column inches and a mediocre song are enough to guarantee success .
at others , a lovingly crafted album can stall despite a top 10 single , positive reviews and a tour supporting justin timberlake .
that was the situation natasha bedingfield found herself in last summer when her second release , nb , dropped gracelessly out of the charts .
so when she left the uk to promote the album in the us , something needed to change .
and what changed was the album itself .
all but six of nb 's quirky girlpop anthems were jettisoned in favour of a bunch of new , r & b-flavoured songs .
it proved a successful tactic .
pocket full of sunshine , as the album was re-christened , shot to number three in its first week on the charts , selling more than 50,000 copies .
i feel disappointed when i listen to music and it brings you down and feeds bitterness and anger natasha bedingfield but bedingfield says her us record label never put any pressure on her to revamp the album .
" it was n't a case of ' you have to record new stuff , " ' she says .
" all last summer i was on tour with justin timberlake and wherever i could , i would try to write .
" by the time i came to releasing the album in the states , i had a lot of new songs i wanted to put on there .
i did n't want to be stuck performing stuff from the year before . "
there is no doubting the ambition of the 26-year-old bedingfield .
last year , she told the bbc it was her " big goal to be a global artist " and that america was " the final push " .
and , as pocket full of sunshine racked up sales in the us , she scrapped a uk tour , explaining that her us label " insisted " she remained stateside .
the star 's mother runs the children 's charity global angels while there , she has been able to observe the seemingly endless presidential race , where barack obama has been using her single unwritten in his campaign .
" did they approach me ?
no , i think they just used it , " she says .
" but i was very excited because i think he 's very inspiring .
" a lot of people who do n't normally vote have come out of hiding because of this guy who 's bringing back hope . "
bedingfield 's uplifting pop fitted in well with the democratic hopeful 's campaign .
raised as a christian , there is often a spiritual edge to her music , where the lyrics - while dealing with self-doubt and failed relationships - always contain a spark of hope .
" i feel disappointed when i listen to music and it brings you down and feeds bitterness and anger , " she says .
" i 'm a glass half full person .
i 'm honest about where i 'm at , but i like to look out for a way out as well .
no wallowing in self pity ! "
hidden art not that bedingfield has the time to indulge in much soul searching these days .
her promotional schedule is so hectic that she can barely remember coming back to the uk to spend valentine 's day with her boyfriend .
" i do n't remember ...
i was n't in london for valentine 's , was i ?
oh wait !
yes , i was !
" my boyfriend cooked me dinner - a salmon , which was delicious .
the singer performed at last year 's concert for diana " i know it sounds like a very ordinary thing , but it was very special for us because we 're always in hotels ! "
hotel life has its advantages for a restless soul like bedingfield - " i 'm never there long enough to get bored " - and she has discovered a hidden world of art in the motels of america .
" there 's a whole bunch of people that do hidden graffiti in hotel rooms , " she enthuses .
" they take a picture away from a wall and draw something behind it , then they put it back so no-one in the hotel knows .
" it 's like this underground art scene for business people .
they 're very serious in their lives , but they have a rebellious side - kind of like fight club .
" have i ever been tempted ?
oh yeah ... but i 'd probably run out of time to finish it . "
with pocket full of sunshine due for release in the uk this summer , bedingfield is guaranteed to have more opportunities to become a bedroom banksy .
perhaps she should strike while the iron is hot .
pop can be a tricky business , after all .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- bedingfield gets a second chance bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture 07:34 gmt , thursday , 10 april 2008 08:34 uk bedingfield gets a second chance by mark savage entertainment reporter , bbc news pop music can be a tricky business .
sometimes , a quirky haircut , the right dose of column inches and a mediocre song are enough to guarantee success .
at others , a lovingly crafted album can stall despite a top 10 single , positive reviews and a tour supporting justin timberlake .
that was the situation natasha bedingfield found herself in last summer when her second release , nb , dropped gracelessly out of the charts .
so when she left the uk to promote the album in the us , something needed to change .
and what changed was the album itself .
all but six of nb 's quirky girlpop anthems were jettisoned in favour of a bunch of new , r & b-flavoured songs .
it proved a successful tactic .
pocket full of sunshine , as the album was re-christened , shot to number three in its first week on the charts , selling more than 50,000 copies . "
i feel disappointed when i listen to music and it brings you down and feeds bitterness and anger " natasha bedingfield but bedingfield says her us record label never put any pressure on her to revamp the album .
" it was n't a case of ' you have to record new stuff , " ' she says .
" all last summer i was on tour with justin timberlake and wherever i could , i would try to write .
" by the time i came to releasing the album in the states , i had a lot of new songs i wanted to put on there .
i did n't want to be stuck performing stuff from the year before . "
there is no doubting the ambition of the 26-year-old bedingfield .
last year , she told the bbc it was her " big goal to be a global artist " and that america was " the final push " .
and , as pocket full of sunshine racked up sales in the us , she scrapped a uk tour , explaining that her us label " insisted " she remained stateside .
while there , she has been able to observe the seemingly endless presidential race , where barack obama has been using her single unwritten in his campaign .
" did they approach me ?
no , i think they just used it , " she says .
" but i was very excited because i think he 's very inspiring .
" a lot of people who do n't normally vote have come out of hiding because of this guy who 's bringing back hope . "
bedingfield 's uplifting pop fitted in well with the democratic hopeful 's campaign .
raised as a christian , there is often a spiritual edge to her music , where the lyrics - while dealing with self-doubt and failed relationships - always contain a spark of hope .
" i feel disappointed when i listen to music and it brings you down and feeds bitterness and anger , " she says .
" i 'm a glass half full person .
i 'm honest about where i 'm at , but i like to look out for a way out as well .
no wallowing in self pity ! "
hidden art not that bedingfield has the time to indulge in much soul searching these days .
her promotional schedule is so hectic that she can barely remember coming back to the uk to spend valentine 's day with her boyfriend .
" i do n't remember ...
i was n't in london for valentine 's , was i ?
oh wait !
yes , i was !
" my boyfriend cooked me dinner - a salmon , which was delicious .
" i know it sounds like a very ordinary thing , but it was very special for us because we 're always in hotels ! "
hotel life has its advantages for a restless soul like bedingfield - " i 'm never there long enough to get bored " - and she has discovered a hidden world of art in the motels of america .
" there 's a whole bunch of people that do hidden graffiti in hotel rooms , " she enthuses .
" they take a picture away from a wall and draw something behind it , then they put it back so no-one in the hotel knows .
" it 's like this underground art scene for business people .
they 're very serious in their lives , but they have a rebellious side - kind of like fight club .
" have i ever been tempted ?
oh yeah ... but i 'd probably run out of time to finish it . "
with pocket full of sunshine due for release in the uk this summer , bedingfield is guaranteed to have more opportunities to become a bedroom banksy .
perhaps she should strike while the iron is hot .
pop can be a tricky business , after all .
natasha bedingfield 's new single , love like this , is out in the uk now .

the company has announced a two-week experiment during which it will show search-driven google adverts alongside the search results of yahoo 's website .
at the same time yahoo is reportedly talking to rival internet portal aol about a merger .
some analysts have described yahoo 's manoeuvring as a " really clever move " .
excited investors rewarded the company with a 7 % rise in its share price .
however , they are sadly mistaken .
if anything , these moves are proof positive that yahoo is standing with the back against the firewall of its internet servers .
broken model when yahoo rejected microsoft 's $ 44.6bn takeover bid -lrb- now worth a tad less following the stockmarket gyrations -rrb- , it did so arguing that the offer seriously undervalued its earnings potential .
good things were to come , said yahoo 's management , outlining a three-year strategic plan and promising " new products and ... actions which leverage our scale , technology , people and platforms " .
earlier this week , when microsoft set yahoo 's board a three-week deadline to agree to the deal or face a reduced offer , yahoo trumpeted a new advertising management platform , called amp ! , that would help transform the business .
yahoo is racing to escape microsoft in reality , though , yahoo has simply failed to deliver .
a year ago the company launched with great fanfare " panama " , the latest version of its search marketing service .
advertisers do n't seem to have taken a lot of notice .
yahoo 's former arch rival google continued to extend its lead in the lucrative market for search advertising .
the fact that yahoo is now trying out google 's search algorithm to deliver adverts is an acknowledgement that its own paid search model is broken .
yes , even google 's ad clicks have fallen recently , but that appears to be the result of a deliberate move .
the number of ads on each search results page has been reduced , because google wants to deliver advertisers fewer but more valuable clicks .
too many adverts are not quite relevant to the search .
offering adverts that better fit the search should result in happier searchers and higher conversion rates - where the click on the advert actually results in a sale .
beware the regulator do you hear that rustling sound ?
it 's the noise of competition watchdogs around the world whipping out their notepads to add up the search market share of both yahoo and google .
for paid search the combination of google and yahoo would control more than 90 % of the market .
no regulator worth his or her salt will allow such a combination , not least given the fact that online advertising is a rapidly growing market place .
trapped under a boulder there is just one way for yahoo to escape the loving , albeit suffocating , embrace of microsoft .
if the advertising experiment with google is a success , yahoo can prove to potential suitors that its online properties - and the millions of eyeballs that they attract - are still highly valuable .
however , it would also prove that yahoo is struggling simply because it has been badly run .
has yahoo lost its way ?
and it would put the firm into a very awkward position .
yahoo thinks of itself as a technology company .
and indeed , the firm stands on two legs - its media and its technology operations .
but if yahoo can only be truly successful by using google 's search technology , then the firm would start to resemble a hiker that has become trapped under a boulder .
struggling to break free , the hiker realises that in order to escape and survive he has to amputate one of his limbs - in yahoo 's case a key part of its technology division .
it would be a bloody and painful affair .
at the end of it , yahoo would be a mere media company .
that 's not a bad thing , but it would not sit well with yahoo 's image of itself .
microsoft 's bid , in contrast , is centred around combining yahoo 's and microsoft 's technical expertise to compete with google .
that does n't mean that a combination of yahoo and microsoft can succeed - far from it .
but the latest manoeuvrings demonstrate just how desperate yahoo 's situation has become .

excited investors rewarded the company with a 7 % rise in its share price .
however , they are sadly mistaken .
if anything , these moves are proof positive that yahoo is standing with the back against the firewall of its internet servers .
broken model when yahoo rejected microsoft 's $ 44.6bn takeover bid -lrb- now worth a tad less following the stockmarket gyrations -rrb- , it did so arguing that the offer seriously undervalued its earnings potential .
good things were to come , said yahoo 's management , outlining a three-year strategic plan and promising " new products and ... actions which leverage our scale , technology , people and platforms " .
earlier this week , when microsoft set yahoo 's board a three-week deadline to agree to the deal or face a reduced offer , yahoo trumpeted a new advertising management platform , called amp ! , that would help transform the business .
yahoo is racing to escape microsoft in reality , though , yahoo has simply failed to deliver .
a year ago the company launched with great fanfare " panama " , the latest version of its search marketing service .
advertisers do n't seem to have taken a lot of notice .
yahoo 's former arch rival google continued to extend its lead in the lucrative market for search advertising .
the fact that yahoo is now trying out google 's search algorithm to deliver adverts is an acknowledgement that its own paid search model is broken .
yes , even google 's ad clicks have fallen recently , but that appears to be the result of a deliberate move .
the number of ads on each search results page has been reduced , because google wants to deliver advertisers fewer but more valuable clicks .
too many adverts are not quite relevant to the search .
offering adverts that better fit the search should result in happier searchers and higher conversion rates - where the click on the advert actually results in a sale .
beware the regulator do you hear that rustling sound ?
it 's the noise of competition watchdogs around the world whipping out their notepads to add up the search market share of both yahoo and google .
for paid search the combination of google and yahoo would control more than 90 % of the market .
no regulator worth his or her salt will allow such a combination , not least given the fact that online advertising is a rapidly growing market place .
trapped under a boulder there is just one way for yahoo to escape the loving , albeit suffocating , embrace of microsoft .
if the advertising experiment with google is a success , yahoo can prove to potential suitors that its online properties - and the millions of eyeballs that they attract - are still highly valuable .
however , it would also prove that yahoo is struggling simply because it has been badly run .
has yahoo lost its way ?
and it would put the firm into a very awkward position .
yahoo thinks of itself as a technology company .
and indeed , the firm stands on two legs - its media and its technology operations .
but if yahoo can only be truly successful by using google 's search technology , then the firm would start to resemble a hiker that has become trapped under a boulder .
struggling to break free , the hiker realises that in order to escape and survive he has to amputate one of his limbs - in yahoo 's case a key part of its technology division .
it would be a bloody and painful affair .
at the end of it , yahoo would be a mere media company .
that 's not a bad thing , but it would not sit well with yahoo 's image of itself .
microsoft 's bid , in contrast , is centred around combining yahoo 's and microsoft 's technical expertise to compete with google .
that does n't mean that a combination of yahoo and microsoft can succeed - far from it .
but the latest manoeuvrings demonstrate just how desperate yahoo 's situation has become .

former national offender management service drug treatment head huseyin djemil said the prison service had no idea of the size of the drugs market .
he told bbc radio 4 's the investigation the service needed to " get smarter " if it wanted to reduce drugs in prisons .
the government said the number of prisoners testing positive for drugs had fallen from 25 % to 9 % since 1997 .
regular users mr djemil estimated a worst case scenario of 20kg of drugs , mostly heroin , being smuggled into jails each week .
that amounts to more than 1,000kg , with a street value of about £ 100m , each year .
his analysis is backed up by figures from england 's largest jail , wandsworth , which estimated that about £ 1m worth of drugs were trafficked within the prison a year .
the government estimates that more than half the prison population are regular drug users - that would amount to more than 40,000 inmates .
ministers are currently conducting an inquiry into ways of disrupting the supply of drugs in prisons .
it is due to report at the end of may .
supply routes in one case of supply , last december a former prison guard and two inmates were sentenced for supplying drugs to a privately-run warwickshire prison .
former guard gordon hacker had admitted conspiring to smuggle cannabis into hmp rye hill between november 2004 and april 2005 .
he had advised the inmates of the best times for drugs to be thrown over the prison wall .
in a separate case , in peterborough last month mark berry was imprisoned after being convicted of supplying drugs to an inmate .
he had tried to pass methadone and cannabis to his ex-partner who was serving time in peterborough prison .
the investigation can be heard on bbc radio 4 at 2000 bst on thursday 10 april .

former national offender management service drug treatment head huseyin djemil said the prison service had no idea of the size of the drugs market .
he told bbc radio 4 's the investigation the service needed to " get smarter " if it wanted to reduce drugs in prisons .
the government said the number of prisoners testing positive for drugs had fallen from 25 % to 9 % since 1997 .
regular users mr djemil estimated a worst case scenario of 20kg of drugs , mostly heroin , being smuggled into jails each week .
that amounts to more than 1,000kg , with a street value of about £ 100m , each year .
his analysis is backed up by figures from england 's largest jail , wandsworth , which estimated that about £ 1m worth of drugs were trafficked within the prison a year .
the government estimates that more than half the prison population are regular drug users - that would amount to more than 40,000 inmates .
ministers are currently conducting an inquiry into ways of disrupting the supply of drugs in prisons .
it is due to report at the end of may .
supply routes in one case of supply , last december a former prison guard and two inmates were sentenced for supplying drugs to a privately-run warwickshire prison .
former guard gordon hacker had admitted conspiring to smuggle cannabis into hmp rye hill between november 2004 and april 2005 .
he had advised the inmates of the best times for drugs to be thrown over the prison wall .
in a separate case , in peterborough last month mark berry was imprisoned after being convicted of supplying drugs to an inmate .
he had tried to pass methadone and cannabis to his ex-partner who was serving time in peterborough prison .
the investigation can be heard on bbc radio 4 at 2000 bst on thursday 10 april .

former national offender management service drug treatment head huseyin djemil said the prison service had no idea of the size of the drugs market .
he told bbc radio 4 's the investigation the service needed to " get smarter " if it wanted to reduce drugs in prisons .
the government said the number of prisoners testing positive for drugs had fallen from 25 % to 9 % since 1997 .
regular users mr djemil estimated a worst case scenario of 20kg of drugs , mostly heroin , being smuggled into jails each week .
that amounts to more than 1,000kg , with a street value of about £ 100m , each year .
his analysis is backed up by figures from england 's largest jail , wandsworth , which estimated that about £ 1m worth of drugs were trafficked within the prison a year .
the government estimates that more than half the prison population are regular drug users - that would amount to more than 40,000 inmates .

the deal means that myspacetv shows such as quarterlife , roommates and special delivery will soon air on screens outside the us .
the deal was signed with the shine group which is run by elizabeth murdoch - daughter of rupert murdoch who owns myspace parent news international .
the deal covers dvds and merchandise but myspace retains all net rights to its programmes .
poor show " myspace is essentially the world 's largest focus group , " said travis katz , head of myspace 's international arm , announcing the deal at the miptv-milia conference in cannes .
" you can see what resonates with people and then take that content and blow it out worldwide , " he added .
mr katz said myspace was developing local versions of its existing programmes plus original content in the 26 countries in which it operated and added that the company was discussing with hundreds of others about deals on its shows .
the deal marks a fresh attempt by myspace to find an audience for its programmes beyond the internet .
us network nbc broadcast myspace 's " quarterlife " in february but viewing figures suggest it ranked dead last among all shows aired in that time slot .
many media companies have tried , and failed , to use the web as a testing ground for new shows , forrester research analyst james mcquivey told the reuters news agency .
" it has n't produced bankable shows outside of the internet , or even on the internet , " he said .
" if you look at it -lrb- web shows -rrb- , there 's a good reason why - it 's mostly bad . "
the myspacetv deal comes only days after the social networking site announced a partnership with three record labels to create an online music store .

the deal means that myspacetv shows such as quarterlife , roommates and special delivery will soon air on screens outside the us .
the deal was signed with the shine group which is run by elizabeth murdoch - daughter of rupert murdoch who owns myspace parent news international .
the deal covers dvds and merchandise but myspace retains all net rights to its programmes .
poor show " myspace is essentially the world 's largest focus group , " said travis katz , head of myspace 's international arm , announcing the deal at the miptv-milia conference in cannes .
" you can see what resonates with people and then take that content and blow it out worldwide , " he added .
mr katz said myspace was developing local versions of its existing programmes plus original content in the 26 countries in which it operated and added that the company was discussing with hundreds of others about deals on its shows .
the deal marks a fresh attempt by myspace to find an audience for its programmes beyond the internet .
us network nbc broadcast myspace 's " quarterlife " in february but viewing figures suggest it ranked dead last among all shows aired in that time slot .
many media companies have tried , and failed , to use the web as a testing ground for new shows , forrester research analyst james mcquivey told the reuters news agency .
" it has n't produced bankable shows outside of the internet , or even on the internet , " he said .
" if you look at it -lrb- web shows -rrb- , there 's a good reason why - it 's mostly bad . "
the myspacetv deal comes only days after the social networking site announced a partnership with three record labels to create an online music store .

the deal means that myspacetv shows such as quarterlife , roommates and special delivery will soon air on screens outside the us .
the deal was signed with the shine group which is run by elizabeth murdoch - daughter of rupert murdoch who owns myspace parent news international .
the deal covers dvds and merchandise but myspace retains all net rights to its programmes .
poor show " myspace is essentially the world 's largest focus group , " said travis katz , head of myspace 's international arm , announcing the deal at the miptv-milia conference in cannes .
" you can see what resonates with people and then take that content and blow it out worldwide , " he added .
mr katz said myspace was developing local versions of its existing programmes plus original content in the 26 countries in which it operated and added that the company was discussing with hundreds of others about deals on its shows .
the deal marks a fresh attempt by myspace to find an audience for its programmes beyond the internet .
us network nbc broadcast myspace 's " quarterlife " in february but viewing figures suggest it ranked dead last among all shows aired in that time slot .
many media companies have tried , and failed , to use the web as a testing ground for new shows , forrester research analyst james mcquivey told the reuters news agency .
" it has n't produced bankable shows outside of the internet , or even on the internet , " he said .
" if you look at it -lrb- web shows -rrb- , there 's a good reason why - it 's mostly bad . "
the myspacetv deal comes only days after the social networking site announced a partnership with three record labels to create an online music store .
myspace music will be launched in conjunction with universal , sony bmg and warner .
