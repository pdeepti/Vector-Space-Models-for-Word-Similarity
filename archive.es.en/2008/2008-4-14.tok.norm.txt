unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .
germany ’ s average tumor size was twice that . “ there is room for improvement , but we are catching up fast .
the outcomes for patients are getting better and better here , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will be the conservative billionaire 's third term as italy 's prime minister . veltroni 's concession came after early results from the two-day election projected a big majority in both houses of parliament for the 71-year-old media magnate , who now has a strong mandate to deal with italy 's deep economic and social problems . " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work , " veltroni told supporters . the piepoli polling institute had earlier tipped berlusconi 's center-right coalition to win 164 of the senate 's 315 seats , giving him an absolute majority in the chamber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi leaving a downtown milan polling section on sunday in the lower house chamber of deputies - where the winning coalition is automatically awarded 340 seats of a total 630 - berlusconi 's forces won 46.4 percent , according to projections based on a 41-percent vote sample . berlusconi had all but claimed victory little more than an hour before veltroni 's concession speech .
during the election campaign , berlusconi vowed to cut taxes and rein in italy 's huge debt .
while he had been widely expected to win the lower house , his strong senate majority will help him push through structural reforms many say italy needs to stay out of recession . far-left resignation veltroni 's defeat prompted fausto bertinotti , the head of the newly formed far-left rainbow left party grouping communists and greens , to resign from politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians elected their 62nd government since world war two " my role in the leadership ends here , this evening , with a defeat , i 'm afraid .
i will continue to be active , i will continue to help out , but my career ends here , " bertinotti , 68 , told reporters , according to the ansa news agency . " it 's a complete defeat of unforetold proportions , " he said .
" now all the parties making up the italian left need to talk . " the far-left parties formed the rainbow left after veltroni excluded them when he set up his american-style democratic party in october . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "

there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .

biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .

by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .
the poor and hungry of this world need food aid , but they also need work opportunities and fair trade . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .

siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .

germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .
the poor and hungry of this world need food aid , but they also need work opportunities and fair trade . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .
germany ’ s average tumor size was twice that . “ there is room for improvement , but we are catching up fast .
the outcomes for patients are getting better and better here , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 14.04.2008 survivors create awareness for breast cancer in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pink is the color of breast cancer awareness a breast cancer conference opens in berlin on tuesday , april 15 .
unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .
germany ’ s average tumor size was twice that . “ there is room for improvement , but we are catching up fast .
the outcomes for patients are getting better and better here , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero chose nine women and eight men to lead the country , including a highly pregnant 37-year-old defense minister . king juan carlos swore in the cabinet on monday , april 14 , two days after zapatero 's inauguration as prime minister for a second four-year term . " i 'm very proud that there are more female than male ministers , " socialist politician zapatero said .
" this is a modern and strong government . " for the most part , however , the premier has left key ministries untouched , with miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister , alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister and pedro solbes as finance minister .
maria teresa fernandez de la vega remains deputy premier . the appointment that has attracted the most attention is that of carme chacon as defense minister .
the posting is a reward for the socialist rising star 's victory in parliamentary elections in catalonia on march 9 .
she is spain 's first female defense minister .
the 37-year-old , who is expecting her first child in the summer , was previously housing minister .
she 's not been recorded as having ever commented publicly on defense issues and is known as a pacifist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the socialists won march 9 elections , but are still short of a majority in parliament zapatero also named his former chief economic advisor , miguel sebastian , industry minister , which includes the energy sector .
sebastian is thought to have played an important role in the two-year takeover battle for spanish power utility endesa , reuters reported .
german utility e.on eventually lost out to italian utility enel and spanish infrastructure group acciona .
sebastian would be an important player in any further shakeup of the sector .

the new science and innovation ministry will be led by basque scientist cristina garmendia and is intended to wean spain off its dependence on construction and nurture hi-tech industries .
celestino corbacho and beatriz corredor are also new to the cabinet as labor and housing ministers . the international monetary fund says spain 's economy will only grow by 1.8 percent this year , down from 3.8 percent in 2007 , as the credit crunch hits heavily-indebted businesses and households . zapatero was sworn in on saturday , the day after parliament reelected him premier in a second round of voting .
his candidacy had failed in the first round last week .
the 47-year-old heads up a minority government this legislative term .
although the socialist party won the election last month , it came out seven seats short of a majority . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the news : heinrich von pierer the issue is no small one for siemens , which is listed on the us stock exchange , because the us securities and exchange commission could force it to pay high fines .
widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .

" what i can say looking back not least on my own life is that unification and the creation of the eu is the best thing that has happened to europe in its long history , " merkel told a forum of politicians and campaigners in dublin . " to my mind the lisbon treaty offers the best preparation for europe 's future .
let us all make sure that the european union continues to flourish , " she said . " to the skeptics , i can only say that if everything remains as it is now , your concerns will definitely not be better addressed .

yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .

but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .
" that will take 10 to 20 years , " she told the news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .
germany ’ s average tumor size was twice that . “ there is room for improvement , but we are catching up fast .
the outcomes for patients are getting better and better here , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 14.04.2008 opinion : prosperity 's high price großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increasing food prices mean many are going hungry .
while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .

it will be the conservative billionaire 's third term as italy 's prime minister . veltroni 's concession came after early results from the two-day election projected a big majority in both houses of parliament for the 71-year-old media magnate , who now has a strong mandate to deal with italy 's deep economic and social problems .

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .

siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .

it will be the conservative billionaire 's third term as italy 's prime minister . veltroni 's concession came after early results from the two-day election projected a big majority in both houses of parliament for the 71-year-old media magnate , who now has a strong mandate to deal with italy 's deep economic and social problems . " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work , " veltroni told supporters . the piepoli polling institute had earlier tipped berlusconi 's center-right coalition to win 164 of the senate 's 315 seats , giving him an absolute majority in the chamber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi leaving a downtown milan polling section on sunday in the lower house chamber of deputies - where the winning coalition is automatically awarded 340 seats of a total 630 - berlusconi 's forces won 46.4 percent , according to projections based on a 41-percent vote sample . berlusconi had all but claimed victory little more than an hour before veltroni 's concession speech .
during the election campaign , berlusconi vowed to cut taxes and rein in italy 's huge debt .
while he had been widely expected to win the lower house , his strong senate majority will help him push through structural reforms many say italy needs to stay out of recession . far-left resignation veltroni 's defeat prompted fausto bertinotti , the head of the newly formed far-left rainbow left party grouping communists and greens , to resign from politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italians elected their 62nd government since world war two " my role in the leadership ends here , this evening , with a defeat , i 'm afraid .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .
" that will take 10 to 20 years , " she told the news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero chose nine women and eight men to lead the country , including a highly pregnant 37-year-old defense minister . king juan carlos swore in the cabinet on monday , april 14 , two days after zapatero 's inauguration as prime minister for a second four-year term . " i 'm very proud that there are more female than male ministers , " socialist politician zapatero said .
" this is a modern and strong government . " for the most part , however , the premier has left key ministries untouched , with miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister , alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister and pedro solbes as finance minister .
maria teresa fernandez de la vega remains deputy premier . the appointment that has attracted the most attention is that of carme chacon as defense minister .
the posting is a reward for the socialist rising star 's victory in parliamentary elections in catalonia on march 9 .
she is spain 's first female defense minister .
the 37-year-old , who is expecting her first child in the summer , was previously housing minister .
she 's not been recorded as having ever commented publicly on defense issues and is known as a pacifist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the socialists won march 9 elections , but are still short of a majority in parliament zapatero also named his former chief economic advisor , miguel sebastian , industry minister , which includes the energy sector .
sebastian is thought to have played an important role in the two-year takeover battle for spanish power utility endesa , reuters reported .
german utility e.on eventually lost out to italian utility enel and spanish infrastructure group acciona .
sebastian would be an important player in any further shakeup of the sector .
stress on equality the youngest cabinet member is 31-year-old bibiana aido , who will head up the newly created equality ministry .
the new science and innovation ministry will be led by basque scientist cristina garmendia and is intended to wean spain off its dependence on construction and nurture hi-tech industries .
celestino corbacho and beatriz corredor are also new to the cabinet as labor and housing ministers . the international monetary fund says spain 's economy will only grow by 1.8 percent this year , down from 3.8 percent in 2007 , as the credit crunch hits heavily-indebted businesses and households . zapatero was sworn in on saturday , the day after parliament reelected him premier in a second round of voting .
his candidacy had failed in the first round last week .
the 47-year-old heads up a minority government this legislative term .
although the socialist party won the election last month , it came out seven seats short of a majority . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .
" that will take 10 to 20 years , " she told the news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .
" that will take 10 to 20 years , " she told the news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .

that 's why the pizzas sold in poland have a lot of onions on them , said the ceo . in poland , as well as russia , dr. oetker maintains local factories - not least to save on customs fees and transportation costs . german pizza in italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker perks up its polish pizzas the company is currently exploring the chinese market , said oetker , and closely observing the eating habits there to find out which products could be successful .
it has already learned that pizza - with or without the extra onions - does n't sell well everywhere .
in india , for example , the sweet dessert products have gone over much better . oetker emphasized the importance of paying attention to local taste .
" no one in sicily eats german pork knuckles , so we sell pizza there instead , " he said .
" and the italians are buying german pizza . " which pizza variety does the boss like most ? " pepperoni - we have one that 's spicier and one that 's not so spicy .

it will be the conservative billionaire 's third term as italy 's prime minister . veltroni 's concession came after early results from the two-day election projected a big majority in both houses of parliament for the 71-year-old media magnate , who now has a strong mandate to deal with italy 's deep economic and social problems . " as is the custom in all western democracies , i telephoned berlusconi to acknowledge his victory and wish him good luck in his work , " veltroni told supporters . the piepoli polling institute had earlier tipped berlusconi 's center-right coalition to win 164 of the senate 's 315 seats , giving him an absolute majority in the chamber . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi leaving a downtown milan polling section on sunday in the lower house chamber of deputies - where the winning coalition is automatically awarded 340 seats of a total 630 - berlusconi 's forces won 46.4 percent , according to projections based on a 41-percent vote sample . berlusconi had all but claimed victory little more than an hour before veltroni 's concession speech .

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the news : heinrich von pierer the issue is no small one for siemens , which is listed on the us stock exchange , because the us securities and exchange commission could force it to pay high fines .
widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .

prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero chose nine women and eight men to lead the country , including a highly pregnant 37-year-old defense minister . king juan carlos swore in the cabinet on monday , april 14 , two days after zapatero 's inauguration as prime minister for a second four-year term . " i 'm very proud that there are more female than male ministers , " socialist politician zapatero said .
" this is a modern and strong government . " for the most part , however , the premier has left key ministries untouched , with miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister , alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister and pedro solbes as finance minister .
maria teresa fernandez de la vega remains deputy premier . the appointment that has attracted the most attention is that of carme chacon as defense minister .
the posting is a reward for the socialist rising star 's victory in parliamentary elections in catalonia on march 9 .
she is spain 's first female defense minister .
the 37-year-old , who is expecting her first child in the summer , was previously housing minister .
she 's not been recorded as having ever commented publicly on defense issues and is known as a pacifist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the socialists won march 9 elections , but are still short of a majority in parliament zapatero also named his former chief economic advisor , miguel sebastian , industry minister , which includes the energy sector .
sebastian is thought to have played an important role in the two-year takeover battle for spanish power utility endesa , reuters reported .
german utility e.on eventually lost out to italian utility enel and spanish infrastructure group acciona .
sebastian would be an important player in any further shakeup of the sector .
stress on equality the youngest cabinet member is 31-year-old bibiana aido , who will head up the newly created equality ministry .
the new science and innovation ministry will be led by basque scientist cristina garmendia and is intended to wean spain off its dependence on construction and nurture hi-tech industries .
celestino corbacho and beatriz corredor are also new to the cabinet as labor and housing ministers . the international monetary fund says spain 's economy will only grow by 1.8 percent this year , down from 3.8 percent in 2007 , as the credit crunch hits heavily-indebted businesses and households . zapatero was sworn in on saturday , the day after parliament reelected him premier in a second round of voting .
his candidacy had failed in the first round last week .
the 47-year-old heads up a minority government this legislative term .
although the socialist party won the election last month , it came out seven seats short of a majority . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .
the poor and hungry of this world need food aid , but they also need work opportunities and fair trade . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he nominated stanislaw tillich , also a member of angela merkel 's cdu , as his successor . milbradt resigned his functions both as saxony state premier and chairman of the saxon christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he had been under fire within his for months , ever since the virtual collapse of saxony 's state bank .
" i have decided to hand over my official functions , because an orderly and harmonious transition is especially important to me - and to prevent injuries - to me and others , " the 63-year-old said on monday in dresden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 14.04.2008 survivors create awareness for breast cancer in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pink is the color of breast cancer awareness a breast cancer conference opens in berlin on tuesday , april 15 .
unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .

unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .

she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .
germany ’ s average tumor size was twice that . “ there is room for improvement , but we are catching up fast .
the outcomes for patients are getting better and better here , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the news : heinrich von pierer the issue is no small one for siemens , which is listed on the us stock exchange , because the us securities and exchange commission could force it to pay high fines .
widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .
siemens engineers also gain exposure to construction sites that are n't visible by us satellite photography , according to the magazine . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .
" that will take 10 to 20 years , " she told the news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero chose nine women and eight men to lead the country , including a highly pregnant 37-year-old defense minister . king juan carlos swore in the cabinet on monday , april 14 , two days after zapatero 's inauguration as prime minister for a second four-year term . " i 'm very proud that there are more female than male ministers , " socialist politician zapatero said .
" this is a modern and strong government . " for the most part , however , the premier has left key ministries untouched , with miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister , alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister and pedro solbes as finance minister .
maria teresa fernandez de la vega remains deputy premier . the appointment that has attracted the most attention is that of carme chacon as defense minister .
the posting is a reward for the socialist rising star 's victory in parliamentary elections in catalonia on march 9 .
she is spain 's first female defense minister .
the 37-year-old , who is expecting her first child in the summer , was previously housing minister .
she 's not been recorded as having ever commented publicly on defense issues and is known as a pacifist .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the socialists won march 9 elections , but are still short of a majority in parliament zapatero also named his former chief economic advisor , miguel sebastian , industry minister , which includes the energy sector .
sebastian is thought to have played an important role in the two-year takeover battle for spanish power utility endesa , reuters reported .
german utility e.on eventually lost out to italian utility enel and spanish infrastructure group acciona .
sebastian would be an important player in any further shakeup of the sector .
stress on equality the youngest cabinet member is 31-year-old bibiana aido , who will head up the newly created equality ministry .
the new science and innovation ministry will be led by basque scientist cristina garmendia and is intended to wean spain off its dependence on construction and nurture hi-tech industries .
celestino corbacho and beatriz corredor are also new to the cabinet as labor and housing ministers . the international monetary fund says spain 's economy will only grow by 1.8 percent this year , down from 3.8 percent in 2007 , as the credit crunch hits heavily-indebted businesses and households . zapatero was sworn in on saturday , the day after parliament reelected him premier in a second round of voting .
his candidacy had failed in the first round last week .
the 47-year-old heads up a minority government this legislative term .
although the socialist party won the election last month , it came out seven seats short of a majority . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his candidacy had failed in the first round last week .
the 47-year-old heads up a minority government this legislative term .

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the news : heinrich von pierer the issue is no small one for siemens , which is listed on the us stock exchange , because the us securities and exchange commission could force it to pay high fines .
widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .

" this is a modern and strong government . " for the most part , however , the premier has left key ministries untouched , with miguel angel moratinos as foreign minister , alfredo perez rubalcaba as interior minister and pedro solbes as finance minister .
maria teresa fernandez de la vega remains deputy premier . the appointment that has attracted the most attention is that of carme chacon as defense minister .
the posting is a reward for the socialist rising star 's victory in parliamentary elections in catalonia on march 9 .
she is spain 's first female defense minister .
the 37-year-old , who is expecting her first child in the summer , was previously housing minister .

his candidacy had failed in the first round last week .
the 47-year-old heads up a minority government this legislative term .

it will be the conservative billionaire 's third term as italy 's prime minister . veltroni 's concession came after early results from the two-day election projected a big majority in both houses of parliament for the 71-year-old media magnate , who now has a strong mandate to deal with italy 's deep economic and social problems .

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .
" that will take 10 to 20 years , " she told the news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the news : heinrich von pierer the issue is no small one for siemens , which is listed on the us stock exchange , because the us securities and exchange commission could force it to pay high fines .
widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .
siemens engineers also gain exposure to construction sites that are n't visible by us satellite photography , according to the magazine . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel calls on brazil to make biofuel production sustainable as biofuels fall from grace , a new generation grabs spotlight germany defends biofuels , hedges bets on energy goals german minister calls for reversal of eu agricultural policy energy -pipe- 14.04.2008 europe defends biofuels as debate rages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuels are coming under mounting criticism europe defended biofuels against charges that their production is a " crime against humanity " that threatens global food supplies .
yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .
" that will take 10 to 20 years , " she told the news agency afp . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the news : heinrich von pierer the issue is no small one for siemens , which is listed on the us stock exchange , because the us securities and exchange commission could force it to pay high fines .
widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .
the poor and hungry of this world need food aid , but they also need work opportunities and fair trade . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while poor countries need food aid , they also need jobs and fair trade , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . while people in wealthy countries worry about how they will fill their cars with gas in the future , people in poor countries increasingly face the problem of how to fill their stomachs .
yes , the increasing use of food for biofuel is one reason for the acute food crisis , but not the only one .
take population growth , for example , which means an additional 80 million people to feed each year .
by the year 2050 the world population is expected to increase by half the current amount , reaching nine billion people .
over 90 percent of these new arrivals will be born in developing countries , where already today 850 million people do n't have enough to eat ; each day umpteen thousands die of hunger .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky it does n't have to be this way .
the causes of the food crisis lie – apart from natural catastrophes – in political , economic and social mistakes .
the earth is fertile enough to feed considerably more than the current existing population .
" the problem is not so much a lack of food as a lack of political will , " the united nations ' food organization said 20 years ago .
this is no different today .
one-fifth of people survive on less than one dollar per day .
it is these people that go to bed with empty stomachs .
hunger decreases whenever there is across-the-board employment , which brings with it purchasing power .
creating employment opportunities and income are the most important measures that can be undertaken to solve the hunger problem .
while this is true , it 's only a part of the picture .
the current food crisis , which has caused an increase in hunger in many countries as well as brought about the collapse of the government in haiti , has to do with the global inflation of food prices and also the flow of trade .
emerging markets have more purchasing power and increasing demand which have to be served by increasing food imports .
yet land used for farming agricultural commodities is being converted into producing biofuel .
this has resulted in already poor developing countries spending a quarter more for food imports than in the previous year .
the price of corn has doubled in the past two years and has caused a tortilla crisis in mexico .
flour is more expensive and scarce than it has been in the past three decades .
the price of rice has nearly doubled in the past two years .
while food price increases are noticeable in industrial countries , for the poor in this world they have deadly consequences .
in the long term , the price increases could be advantageous for poor countries .
but in order for this to happen , industrial countries would need to end their disastrous agricultural protectionism and open their markets for imports from the third world .
developing countries could be competitive in producing agricultural commodities , but not as long as industrial countries protect their farmers by erecting unfair trade barriers .
now is the chance to end this outrage .
naturally , food donations must be given to end acute starvation , but this is not a long-term solution .
industrial countries should open their markets to farm produce from developing countries and contribute to the creation of jobs and income in the third world .
this would allow more people to buy food and satisfy their hunger .
the poor and hungry of this world need food aid , but they also need work opportunities and fair trade . karl zawadzky -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he nominated stanislaw tillich , also a member of angela merkel 's cdu , as his successor . milbradt resigned his functions both as saxony state premier and chairman of the saxon christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
he had been under fire within his for months , ever since the virtual collapse of saxony 's state bank .
" i have decided to hand over my official functions , because an orderly and harmonious transition is especially important to me - and to prevent injuries - to me and others , " the 63-year-old said on monday in dresden . " now is the right time , " he added , indicating he would step down at the end of may . state elections are scheduled for 16 months from now . the bank , sachsen lb , had accumulated massive liabilities from speculating in so-called structured-finance products linked to us home mortgages .

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .

widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .

a former siemens executive is once again in the hot seat in an ongoing bribery case .
the company was also struck by spying accusations . the former management board of german engineering giant siemens knew about bribery allegations earlier than previously thought - as early as november 2003 , a former siemens official told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the munich-based company 's former compliance officer , albrecht schaefer , said he had told former management board chairman heinrich von pierer and other top managers about bribes .
news of earlier information schaefer told a munich court that he had informed management board members about alleged slush funds and bribery payments that were linked to a court case over a turbine contract in italy , the newspaper reported .
" the existence of slush funds at siemens shows that siemens ' means of practicing compliance was fully inefficient and that the company at least was willing to consider bribery as a possible business strategy , " he wrote in an internal document in 2004 .
such accusations against von pierer are not entirely new .
but until now he had claimed to know about certain instances of corruption , while remaining ignorant of widespread practices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the news : heinrich von pierer the issue is no small one for siemens , which is listed on the us stock exchange , because the us securities and exchange commission could force it to pay high fines .
widespread scandal the current advisory board is currently deciding whether or not to sue the prior board members for millions of euros in compensation .
siemens has recently been battered by allegations that employees used slush funds to bribe clients for orders .
by the latest accounts , siemens is accused of having made some 1.3 billion euros in dubious payments , most thought to be foreign bribes .
the us sec and justice department are among the agencies looking into the claims .
the investigation has spread to at least a dozen countries .
to appease the sec , most of the old siemens leadership has left the company .
the legal process surrounding the scandal will start at the end of may .
ex-chief von pierer is expected to take the witness stand .
cooperation with bnd meanwhile , german weekly newsmagazine der spiegel reported that siemens had cooperated closely with germany 's top spy agency for over a decade .
germany 's federal intelligence service , or bnd , had a representative on the management board , spiegel cited unidentified former managers as saying .
the bnd used siemens 's communication technology for espionage purposes , while siemens became the spy agency 's top supplier .
the bnd 's role in siemens could mean it has knowledge of access codes the company uses to conduct maintenance work on communications systems , spiegel said .

unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .

experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .

unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .

the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .

once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .
germany ’ s average tumor size was twice that . “ there is room for improvement , but we are catching up fast .
the outcomes for patients are getting better and better here , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet pressure continues to mount for the european union to back off on its biofuel targets . the european union said it is sticking to its biofuel goals despite mounting criticism from top environmental agencies and poverty advocates .
" there is no question for now of suspending the target fixed for biofuels , " barbara helfferich , spokeswoman for eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said monday , april 14 .
but her boss struck a different tone , acknowledging that the eu had underestimated problems caused by biofuels and saying that the 27-nation block planned to " move very carefully . "
yet the eu is wary of abandoning biofuels amid worries that doing so could derail its landmark climate change and energy package .
in it , europe pledged to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2020 .
part of the package includes setting a target for biofuels to make up 10 percent of automobile fuel .
biofuel a culprit in food crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ziegler called biofuel a " crime against humanity " in recent months food prices have increased sharply .
biofuels are seen as one of several culprits .
land that used to be planted with food crops has been converted to biofuel production , which has increased prices .
un special rapporteur for the right to food jean ziegler told german radio monday that the production of biofuels is " a crime against humanity " because of its impact on global food prices .
the un 's ziegler is n't alone in his criticism of biofuel .
last week the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- , advisors to the european commission , recommended suspending its biofuel target .
the eea argued that the eu will have to import biofuel from abroad , which will accelerate destruction of the rainforests .
the agency also questioned biofuel 's environmental benefits .
peter brabeck-letmathe , head of nestle , the world 's biggest food and beverage company , last month argued that " to grant enormous subsidies for biofuel production is morally unacceptable and irresponsible . "
" there will be nothing left to eat , " letmathe said .
a recent world bank report blamed biofuel production for having pushed up feedstock prices .
poverty , instability top concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : land is increasingly being devoted to biofuel production the concern has become acute now that rising food costs , particularly for staples such as rice and wheat , have sparked violent protests in a dozen countries in recent months .
the issue gained even more prominence during the international monetary fund and world bank spring meetings over the weekend .
world bank president robert zoellick said soaring food costs could potentially push 100 million people deeper into poverty .
a world bank report last week said global wheat prices jumped 181 percent over the 36 months to february , with overall food prices up 83 percent .
eu misjudged impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuel vs. food michael mann , spokesman for eu agriculture commission mariann fischer boel downplayed the role of biofuels in the current crisis .
there 's no danger that too much food production is shifting to biofuels , mann said .
boel , however , has said she wants to get rid of eu subsidies for biofuels , which currently amount to 90 million euros each year .
eu countries will meet may 7 to discuss strict criteria for producing biofuels .
environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu had initially underestimated the danger to rainforests and the risk of forcing up food prices from its policy of setting binding targets for the use of biofuels .
" we have seen that the environmental problems caused by biofuels and also the social problems are bigger than we thought they were .
so we have to move very carefully , " he told the bbc .
food production top priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sharp rise in rice prices has triggered instability french agriculture minister michel barnier said monday that food production must be the priority .
european leaders have stressed they are interested in " second generation " biofuels including leaves , straw and pond algae .
biofuels currently under production – biodiesel and ethanol – are made from wheat , corn and sugar beets . french ecology minister nathalie kosciusko-morizet said she was skeptical about using second generation biofuels .

unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .
germany ’ s average tumor size was twice that . “ there is room for improvement , but we are catching up fast .
the outcomes for patients are getting better and better here , ” she said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 14.04.2008 survivors create awareness for breast cancer in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pink is the color of breast cancer awareness a breast cancer conference opens in berlin on tuesday , april 15 .
unlike the us , germany is not awash in pink ribbons , but in its own way is promoting awareness of a cancer that is the leading cause of death for women . renate haidinger was 42 when she went for a routine gynecological check-up eight years ago .
a former fine arts auctioneer who had been a professional basketball player in her youth , haidinger was fit and had always led a healthy lifestyle .
she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and had two children by the time she turned 30 .
having bigger broods at an earlier age provides greater protection against breast cancer . haidinger was not only at low risk in all respects , but since the majority of breast cancers occur after age 50 , she was also relatively young when a sonogram had picked up a pea-sized lump in her left breast that turned out to be malignant . the tumor , which had grown to almost 3 centimeters -lrb- one inch -rrb- , was taken out within a week , followed by chemotherapy treatments that made her hair fall out .
still the cancer continued to spread and had become so aggressive that haidinger opted to have her entire breast and lymph nodes removed months later . breast cancer hotlines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : having more children at an early age and breastfeeding reduces risk of breast cancer one in eight women faces a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in germany and haidinger is only alive today because her cancer was detected and treated at an early stage . according to the latest health statistics from the robert koch institute in berlin , mortality rates went down from 40 percent to 32 percent in just three years from 2001 to 2004 .
experts say this is because many more women are being diagnosed earlier and cancerous cells are being nipped in the bud before they have a chance of spreading through the lymph nodes to the bloodstream and vital organs . beating her cancer gave haidinger a new lease on life and in 2001 she set up brustkrebs-muenchen e.v. , a psychological support group staffed by breast cancer survivors like herself .
last year the hotline handled 4,000 phone calls , and the numbers keep rising . two years later with the support of us cosmetics giant estee lauder and other sponsors , haidinger also co-founded brustkrebs deutschland e.v.
-lrb- dbkh -rrb- , which disseminates information and promotes breast cancer awareness throughout germany . “ when i first started out , nobody wanted anything to do with breast cancer .
now companies are coming to us , ” said haisinger . german-based rowenta , which makes small household appliances , came on board last year with a hot-selling pink iron and donated 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 47,464 -rrb- in proceeds from the sales .
the bavarian radio station antenne bayern sponsors dbkh ’ s toll-free hotline with gynecologists , surgeons and breast cancer specialists fielding medical questions . corporate sponsors and celebrities hop on bandwagon dbkh ’ s roster of corporate sponsors now includes multinational pharmaceutical companies such as hoffmann-laroche , glaxosmithkline and pfizer , but also the hard rock café and clothing lines such as willy bogner and rosner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using celebrities to promote a good cause prominent germans have also hopped on the bandwagon in a us-style publicity blitz with fashion shows and benefit galas .
even berlin ’ s brandenburger tor was bathed in hot pink lights during breast cancer awareness month , which takes place all over the world in october every year .
pink is the color for breast cancer awareness .
plans are now underway for a pink tour of celebrity readings next october . still the type of campaigning with marches and catwalks all awash in pink ribbons , pink umbrellas and pink paraphernalia , almost ubiquitous in the us , is far less conspicuous in germany . awareness and access susan knox , an american breast cancer survivor and the executive director of the milan-based european advocacy group europa donna , said that no country is like the us when it comes to promoting breast cancer awareness in such a visible way . “ europeans generally have a different approach when it comes to lobbying for health issues , ” she said emphasizing that awareness is important , but so is access to quality medical care and state of the art technology in treating breast cancer . “ in europe , we ’ re working towards equal access to healthcare services and a high baseline standard in the treatment of breast cancer , ” said knox , who explained that most european countries have national health systems that provide universal coverage , so that governments play a key role in promoting breast cancer awareness . screening programs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mammograms and early detection of cancer saves lives last tuesday , germany ’ s health minister ulla schmidt held a conference on a mammography screening program that has just become available nationwide and is free-of-charge for women from 50 to 69 .
once a woman turns 50 , she receives an invitation in the mail once every two years to take part in a free screening at the nearest mammography center and if she lives in a remote rural town , the mobile mammography unit comes to her . “ this initiative came about as a result of lobbying efforts on a european level , ” said knox , whose europa donna is also sponsoring the four-day european cancer organisation -lrb- ecco -rrb- breast cancer conference in berlin that kicks off on april 15 . ecco is an umbrella group that promotes interaction between organizations involved in cancer research , treatment and promoting patient awareness . “ the americans are still much better at early detection , ” said haidinger , adding that a few years ago average size of a breast cancer tumor at time of diagnosis was 1.1 centimeters .

its subsidiary , hamburg sued shipping company , manages over 140 ships , conducting river cruises for tourists one of the conglomerate 's main pillars . it also owns the radeberger group , one of germany 's largest breweries , as well as a series of luxury hotels in germany , france and switzerland . extra onions in poland while business on the home market has stagnated in recent years , sales are booming abroad .
italy , the benelux countries , austria , britain , france , and nearly all of the eastern european countries have become vital markets . but dr. oetker ca n't sell the same food products in every country .
the french prefer lighter pizza , while poles want a heartier meal .
that 's why the pizzas sold in poland have a lot of onions on them , said the ceo . in poland , as well as russia , dr. oetker maintains local factories - not least to save on customs fees and transportation costs . german pizza in italy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oetker perks up its polish pizzas the company is currently exploring the chinese market , said oetker , and closely observing the eating habits there to find out which products could be successful .
it has already learned that pizza - with or without the extra onions - does n't sell well everywhere .
in india , for example , the sweet dessert products have gone over much better . oetker emphasized the importance of paying attention to local taste .
" no one in sicily eats german pork knuckles , so we sell pizza there instead , " he said .
" and the italians are buying german pizza . " which pizza variety does the boss like most ? " pepperoni - we have one that 's spicier and one that 's not so spicy .
i really like them both , " he said . monika lohmueller -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dr barry morgan will tell a conference in llandudno later that churches should " think creatively " about facilities .
he said : " a church that is closed monday to friday is the worst possible advertisement for christianity . "
the archbishop will say how some churches are already making the most of their buildings to attract visitors .
" we can not go on locking up our treasures in closed buildings any more .
we have to open the doors of the churches physically , as well as metaphorically , " said dr morgan he wants churches to think about how their buildings are used , with conference facilities , catering for school groups and counselling services as possibilities .
dr morgan added : " developing community buildings will involve us in new relationships with our communities and opens doors for us to rediscover and develop a proper and appropriate place alongside others in our parishes across the whole of wales . "
the conference , transforming communities and congregations , will hear how churches in the bangor and st asaph dioceses have succeeded in changing people 's perceptions of the church .
st hywyn 's has been upgraded to serve pilgrims as well as parishioners one of the churches to feature at the conference is st hywyn 's at aberdaron , gwynedd , which has been renovated to serve pilgrims making their way to bardsey island , as well as local visitors .
meanwhile , st maelog 's at llanfaelog , anglesey , has built a meeting room above the church for wood and glasswork by local artists , and hosts concerts and classes , as well as worship .
at menai bridge , a renovation of st mary 's church has improved the building for religious services and other uses .
sliding doors have been fitted between the nave and the church 's restored victorian chancel , so the former can hold secular events .
there is also a meeting room , kitchen and gallery in the rear of the old nave .
the reverend raymond smith , vicar of st mary 's said the restoration and new facilities have been welcomed by the congregation .
" we are a church in the community , for the community and we are involved in the community , " he said .
the church nave has been used for concerts and a keep fit class , amongst other events .

"
but the monkeys of sochi have already proven their worth as trailblazers in space - and now they are being groomed for a trip to mars .
the macaques will be the first to experience the radiation that poses a big risk to astronauts - or russian cosmonauts - on any flight to the red planet .
the sochi institute of medical primatology , at vesyoloye near the black sea , has a proud history of involvement in the russian - formerly soviet - space programme .
" people and monkeys have approximately identical sensitivity to small and large radiation doses , " explains the institute 's director , boris lapin .
" so it is better to experiment on the macaques , but not on dogs or other animals . "
the institute will select macaques that may eventually fly to mars before humans do .
after two years of experiments the most suitable 40 monkeys will be sent to the institute of biomedical problems in moscow , where scientists study aerospace biomedicine .
experiments on the monkeys will be carried out at the same time as the mars-500 project .
that project - due to start early next year - is aimed at simulating the conditions of interplanetary flight .
volunteers will have to spend 17 months in a mock-up " spaceship " in moscow .
monkeys may touch down on boulder-strewn mars before humans but a real expedition to mars is not likely to happen for another 10 years at the very least .
gruelling mission in addition to the effects of radiation , space scientists want to see how the monkeys react to prolonged weightless conditions , isolation and a special diet of juices and pureed food .
mars-500 director viktor baranov says 520 days " are enough for the flight to mars - 250 days to fly there , 250 days to come back and a month for the landing on mars " .
today russia is one of the few countries where experiments on primates are carried out .
" humanity sacrifices more than 100 million animals a year in the name of health and beauty .
it 's time to think of an alternative to experiments with animals , " says andrei zbarsky of the international nature conservation group wwf .
the son of space veteran krosh may one day fly to mars " i 'm sure scientists will repeat the story of laika , the first dog in space .
today it 's no secret that the dog died from the nervous stress immediately after the rocket launch and its dead body revolved in orbit for two weeks . "
mr lapin admits that his institute has received some objections from european colleagues concerned about the animal experiments .
a researcher at the institute , anaida shaginyan , says " certainly , i feel sorry for the monkeys , they might die , but the experiments are necessary to preserve the lives of the cosmonauts who will fly to mars in future " .
veteran cosmonauts the institute has a breeding programme for the macaques , so it is not necessary to catch them in the wild .
twelve macaques have flown in russian and soviet spaceships on previous missions .
krosh flew in space in 1992 and is still in rude health abrek and bion were the first into space , in december 1983 .
after a five-day flight they landed in kazakhstan and after rehabilitation returned to the pack .
two years later the monkeys verny and gordy spent seven days in space .
in 1987 dryoma and yerosha spent two weeks in orbit .
after returning from space dryoma was presented to cuban leader fidel castro .
after that there were three two-week flights : in 1989 , 1992 and 1996 .
then the project stopped - russia did not have enough money for the programme .
now experiments are conducted on earth under conditions which simulate weightlessness .
sixteen-year-old space veteran krosh is a star of the institute .
" old man krosh is about 60 years old , if we translate his monkey age to a human life span .
he is very active .
he responds well to food and is aggressive with his female partners , " says ms shaginyan .
" after rehabilitation he produced offspring .
and that 's proof that spaceflight did not harm his health , " she added .

"
but the monkeys of sochi have already proven their worth as trailblazers in space - and now they are being groomed for a trip to mars .
the macaques will be the first to experience the radiation that poses a big risk to astronauts - or russian cosmonauts - on any flight to the red planet .
the sochi institute of medical primatology , at vesyoloye near the black sea , has a proud history of involvement in the russian - formerly soviet - space programme .
" people and monkeys have approximately identical sensitivity to small and large radiation doses , " explains the institute 's director , boris lapin .
" so it is better to experiment on the macaques , but not on dogs or other animals . "
the institute will select macaques that may eventually fly to mars before humans do .
after two years of experiments the most suitable 40 monkeys will be sent to the institute of biomedical problems in moscow , where scientists study aerospace biomedicine .
experiments on the monkeys will be carried out at the same time as the mars-500 project .
that project - due to start early next year - is aimed at simulating the conditions of interplanetary flight .
volunteers will have to spend 17 months in a mock-up " spaceship " in moscow .
monkeys may touch down on boulder-strewn mars before humans but a real expedition to mars is not likely to happen for another 10 years at the very least .
gruelling mission in addition to the effects of radiation , space scientists want to see how the monkeys react to prolonged weightless conditions , isolation and a special diet of juices and pureed food .
mars-500 director viktor baranov says 520 days " are enough for the flight to mars - 250 days to fly there , 250 days to come back and a month for the landing on mars " .

"
but the monkeys of sochi have already proven their worth as trailblazers in space - and now they are being groomed for a trip to mars .
the macaques will be the first to experience the radiation that poses a big risk to astronauts - or russian cosmonauts - on any flight to the red planet .
the sochi institute of medical primatology , at vesyoloye near the black sea , has a proud history of involvement in the russian - formerly soviet - space programme .
" people and monkeys have approximately identical sensitivity to small and large radiation doses , " explains the institute 's director , boris lapin .
" so it is better to experiment on the macaques , but not on dogs or other animals . "
the institute will select macaques that may eventually fly to mars before humans do .
after two years of experiments the most suitable 40 monkeys will be sent to the institute of biomedical problems in moscow , where scientists study aerospace biomedicine .
experiments on the monkeys will be carried out at the same time as the mars-500 project .
that project - due to start early next year - is aimed at simulating the conditions of interplanetary flight .
volunteers will have to spend 17 months in a mock-up " spaceship " in moscow .
monkeys may touch down on boulder-strewn mars before humans but a real expedition to mars is not likely to happen for another 10 years at the very least .
gruelling mission in addition to the effects of radiation , space scientists want to see how the monkeys react to prolonged weightless conditions , isolation and a special diet of juices and pureed food .
mars-500 director viktor baranov says 520 days " are enough for the flight to mars - 250 days to fly there , 250 days to come back and a month for the landing on mars " .
today russia is one of the few countries where experiments on primates are carried out .
" humanity sacrifices more than 100 million animals a year in the name of health and beauty .
it 's time to think of an alternative to experiments with animals , " says andrei zbarsky of the international nature conservation group wwf .
the son of space veteran krosh may one day fly to mars " i 'm sure scientists will repeat the story of laika , the first dog in space .
today it 's no secret that the dog died from the nervous stress immediately after the rocket launch and its dead body revolved in orbit for two weeks . "
mr lapin admits that his institute has received some objections from european colleagues concerned about the animal experiments .
a researcher at the institute , anaida shaginyan , says " certainly , i feel sorry for the monkeys , they might die , but the experiments are necessary to preserve the lives of the cosmonauts who will fly to mars in future " .
veteran cosmonauts the institute has a breeding programme for the macaques , so it is not necessary to catch them in the wild .
twelve macaques have flown in russian and soviet spaceships on previous missions .
krosh flew in space in 1992 and is still in rude health abrek and bion were the first into space , in december 1983 .
after a five-day flight they landed in kazakhstan and after rehabilitation returned to the pack .
two years later the monkeys verny and gordy spent seven days in space .
in 1987 dryoma and yerosha spent two weeks in orbit .
after returning from space dryoma was presented to cuban leader fidel castro .
after that there were three two-week flights : in 1989 , 1992 and 1996 .
then the project stopped - russia did not have enough money for the programme .
now experiments are conducted on earth under conditions which simulate weightlessness .
sixteen-year-old space veteran krosh is a star of the institute .
" old man krosh is about 60 years old , if we translate his monkey age to a human life span .
he is very active .
he responds well to food and is aggressive with his female partners , " says ms shaginyan .
" after rehabilitation he produced offspring .
and that 's proof that spaceflight did not harm his health , " she added .

the test flights will determine if the aeroplane is ready to apply to the civil aviation authority for a " permit to fly " so it can perform during the air show season .

the only way to get a proper diagnosis is with an electrocardiograph -lrb- ecg -rrb- - a machine which monitors the patients heart rhythms , which means a time-consuming trip to hospital .

gps get an instant read-out but more importantly they can get immediate expert advice from the hospital over the phone .
the technology is simple - they simply hold the device next to the phone line and cardiac nurses at the other end of the line interpret the readings and advise whether the patient needs hospital treatment .

dr jonathan lieberman , a gp in manchester who has been using the hand-held device in his surgery said he sees at least one patient a week who needs an ecg and who previously would have been referred .
" before you would have sent them to casualty where they would have had to wait for four hours .
" often you do n't think it is a heart attack but you can have that confirmed there and then .
" it means you 're not having to waste time .
patients love it - they do n't have to go traipsing off to hospital . "
however , if an ecg is negative in a patient with chest pains , they are likely to need further tests for doctors to identify the cause .
routine tests the technology also means gps can carry out routine ecgs in people with long-term heart conditions .
karen gibbons , service improvement manager for greater manchester and cheshire cardiac and stroke network , said in other parts of the country there were waits of several weeks for ecg reports to get back to gps after patients had the test .
" they turn up at the gp and get an instant answer which negates the need for a second gp appointment as well as negating the need for a referral to secondary care , " she said although the government is keen on this kind of telemedicine as a way of giving patients in rural areas better access to specialists , the results from manchester show it can be just as useful in the inner city , she added .
" the service has great potential and has demonstrated that if used on a national level it could generate huge savings for the nhs every year . "
if rolled out across the country , the service could prevent 432,000 referrals to hospital every year , pilot results suggest .
results from use of the technology in a separate study in lancashire and south cumbria sha last year predicted that cuts in referrals to a + e could save the £ 46m per year .
the service is now deployed across 10 pcts in greater manchester with 150 gp practices using the technology .
the british heart foundation said the pilot showed telemedicine could be useful for doctors in helping interpret ecgs .
but bhf cardiac nurse , judy o 'sullivan , pointed out the results did not look at whether patients did better .
" we would like to see a more robust randomised controlled trial , which looks at patient outcome before we can say for certain that this tool leads to better health results for patients with heart disease . "

he has been a regular commentator on the funding cuts that have thrown uk particle physics and astronomy into turmoil .
bbc science reporter paul rincon caught up with prof crowther at queen 's university belfast , which was hosting this year 's national astronomy meeting .
paul rincon : how would you describe the current status of funding of uk astronomy and particle physics ?
paul crowther : we 're talking about fundamental physics : particle physics , astronomy , space science , and nuclear physics .
there was an £ 80m shortfall in the stfc -lrb- science and technology facilities council -rrb- budget for the next three years .
and right now , we 're facing the consequences of that shortfall because we are not able to maintain the existing programme in terms of running laboratories , exploiting facilities and having access to facilities .
so there have been a number of consequences of this shortfall .
what you said about this issue pr : what are the biggest-hit programmes as a result of this shortfall and what do they do from here ?
do scientists just pack up and go home ?
pc : the stfc involves facilities , it involves technology development and it involves science .
there is a certain element that is fixed , involving commitments to subscriptions to , for example , cern -lrb- european organization for nuclear research -rrb- and esa -lrb- european space agency -rrb- .
there are other elements that involve running facilities and laboratories such as diamond -lrb- synchrotron facility -rrb- at harwell .
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible there are other elements such as providing uk involvement in ground-based and space-based telescopes - some of which are under threat .
in addition , there is the access to exploitation grants in departments of physics around the country .
right now , that is also being hit by a 25 % cut in the number of research grants across particle physics , astronomy and nuclear physics .
please turn on javascript .

advertisement watch susan watts ' film on the issue from bbc newsnight pr : so why are scientists so angry ?
presumably funding must have gone up and down in the past - what 's so different about these cuts and the way they 're hitting astronomers and physicists ?
pc : " blue skies " research like astronomy and particle physics has always been up and down .
but it is the scale of the cuts and the suddenness of the cuts that has shocked the community .
the reason we 're so frustrated is that there was no warning , really , before autumn last year about the scale of the cuts .
at some level , it goes back to the way in which this blue skies research is funded .
over a year ago , it was funded through a research council called pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- which was purely astronomy and particle physics .
but that was later merged with the cclrc -lrb- council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- to produce stfc .
it is this combined research council that has - overall - had a pretty decent return from government : 13.6 % over three years is , in principle , a good return .
unfortunately , subscriptions to international commitments and the cost of running laboratories increases at greater than inflation .
astronomers got to question stfc chief keith mason in belfast astronomers ' must make case ' so the effect of this " flat cash " settlement from government has been an unprecedented impact on the ability of , for example , departments to do long-term planning in terms of staff appointments .
because the flat cash settlement does not take into account inflation , spending power is eroded over the three years .
so the research council is facing an inability to deliver on things the government and the scientists would like us to deliver on .
in addition , this new research council has had to take on board these things without the right advisory structures in place .
pr : some commentators have said that the community should have anticipated the squeeze in funding .
is that a view that you have any sympathy with ?
pc : i think there have been communication difficulties - that 's certainly true .
there has been a lack of engagement with the community from this new research council - from the management .
but if we take the blue skies research done in astronomy and particle physics - we got flat cash , as did the epsrc -lrb- engineering and physical sciences research council -rrb- which deals with applied physics .
but they have been impacted by a change of a few percent in the volume of grants and research they can carry out .
the stfc has a different structure which means it has been 25 % .
that is a big hit to take for departments in terms of their long-term planning .
the lack of communication has been the key to the community 's furore over the implementation by the research council of the settlement from government .
pr : what are the big questions astronomers want to ask keith mason , stfc 's chief executive ?
pc : the key from the astronomy perspective is that we want to get the best return for the taxpayer for the money that has gone in .
right now , because of the way in which the stfc has been set up in terms of its advisory structures of scientists , just too few scientists have been involved in the decision-making process .
so the community does n't feel involved or engaged in that process .
when times are good , then everyone 's happy .
but when times are tough , like now , we as a community need to know what the priorities are as a result of this , there has been a prioritisation of which facilities are top priority and are of lower priority , and that has been done by a very small number of scientists .
astronomers are a very disparate bunch .
some people want to study the sun in detail , some want to carry out a mission to mars , others want to study galaxies from space or planets from the ground .
so we all have our own bits of kit we want .
when you have so few scientists on those panels deciding on those prioritisations , even with their best efforts , it has been impossible for the community to feel as if the best use of taxpayers ' money has been made .
it 's really down to getting the most cost-effective return for the money that is available .
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible .
up until now , there has been a lack of confidence from the community in whether the stfc has made the best use of the money we have .
so there was a ranking of facilities and - to give stfc their due - they had a three-week consultation period .
it was short , but nevertheless it went ahead .
now there are small panels deciding on whether they agree or do not agree on the prioritisation that was done by this advisory structure .
pr : so what can we expect from those panels ?
pc : the small panels will be feeding back the community response to the advisory structures in the stfc .
those are going to be responding in the next few weeks .
thereafter , there will be a period of trying to implement those with the fixed amount of money they have .
so we think that by the beginning of july , they will be in a position to say which facilities are to stay and which ones will not .
the concerns many people have is that a lot of the programmes which the uk is leading and will benefit uk scientists in the next five years are in the bottom half of the prioritisation .
some of the things which are in the top half , while addressing fundamental questions , are not where the uk is leading .
they are where the uk is buying into some component .
certain projects , such as emerlin and astrogrid - where the uk has taken a lead - are brand new , just out of the box , yet are facing immediate closure .
pr : there seems to be a real disconnect between the projects that look set to receive continued funding and those which the community thinks should receive continued funding .
are there any patterns that can be teased from the prioritisation ?
has , for example , space exploration fared better than astronomy ?
pc : clearly , the research council has a science and technology strategy .
but the community has n't , as yet , been told what that is .
but it certainly involves things like increased involvement in the space exploration programme through esa .
and that 's a means of the uk securing an esa science centre at harwell in oxfordshire .
and space exploration is a good thing .
the closure of emerlin would hit the jodrell bank facility in cheshire but the concern is that everything else is being squeezed because of that strategy .
therefore , science at some level is at a lower tier than the strategy of the research council .
i think what would be great would be to have a space exploration programme as well as an astronomy and particle physics blue skies programme .
but right now , there are , perhaps , too many things being squeezed into the available budget .
right now , the community feel they have n't had the strategy fully communicated to them and there has been this problem where we 've had to tease information out of government and the research councils using methods such as freedom of information act requests .
when times are good , then everyone 's happy .
but when times are tough , like now , we as a community need to know what the priorities are and what we can do to lobby government , to respond to the priorities of the research council and really get the best return for the money that the uk taxpayer puts in .
pr : lastly , where do you think this could lead in terms of future uk astronomy and particle physics capability ?
what effect is this going to have , for example , on the numbers of young people coming into science ?
pc : clearly , the government has made it clear that they want to make science in universities more directly beneficial to the economy in the short term .
and i think that is the right strategy .
but the concern is that it is particle physics and astronomy that really motivates students towards doing science - especially physics - at university .
the signals that are being sent out right now are negative ones towards fundamental physics and blue skies research .
in the long-term , if you want to have a knowledge-based economy , and a scientifically literate country , then you need to invest - at a relatively modest level compared to other areas of science - in fundamental science , to get students into the system .
once they 're in they find out about amazing things going on in applied physics .
but it is things like astronomy that get students into studying science at university .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with stfc chief executive , prof keith mason .
having close links with daresbury lab in cheshire i am personally seeing the impact this is having on the morale of the staff and scientists .
this facility is fantastic and if you had attended any of the open days which they hold for the staff , their families and the local schools you would really see what motivates children to go and study science .
removing this kind of hands on access to science will damage our science capability for generations to come .
the cuts are very shortsighted .
science is an essential part to every day life without it how would you drive to work in a morning , heat the water to make a brew or find cures for cancer .
lisa j cordwell , irlam the stfc chief exec is quoted here as asserting " we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini . "
compare this to the stfc press release of 15th november : " the stfc informed the board that the stfc , in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond , is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory . "
is it any wonder there was " a bit of a misunderstanding " ?
paul crowther 's www page includes a good summary of contradictory statements from stfc on this issue .
russell smith , durham there is more than a little irony in keith mason laying the blame for astronomy 's current funding problems on the introduction of full economic costing -lrb- fec -rrb- as a mechanism to make research properly sustainable .
the grant that supports astronomy research here in nottingham was scheduled for renewal last year .
we duly put in our bid for support , including the level of fec that had been calculated as appropriate for sustaining research -lrb- using an official audited process called the trac protocol -rrb- .
the grant was highly rated by the review panel , and recommended for funding , including the level of fec that we had requested .
there was then a lengthy delay as the full extent of the funding problems in stfc became apparent .
finally , the grant was announced , but in order to try and meet some of its budget shortfall , the recommended level of fec had been slashed by more than a factor of two .
consultation with other universities that had grants in for renewal this round indicates ! that they suffered comparable arbitrary cuts in the level of fec awarded .
if our experience is anything to go by , stfc is not spending its new money on anything like the level of fec required to sustain a research programme .
michael merrifield , professor of astronomy , university of nottingham , nottingham i found keith mason 's response to the question about students wondering if it was worth staying in astronomy to be quite insulting .
i am approaching the end of a four year masters degree in physics and astrophysics and have been planning to do a phd in some are of space research .
the reason i , like other students , am worried by the cuts is not that i feel i wo n't make money but that the cuts will make it harder for me to find a job at all !
it is the nature of the economy the stfc claims to be supporting that you need to make money to survive .
i know that a research career in astronomy will never make me a millionaire .
if i wanted to make money then i would work in the city where physics degrees are in high demand .
my reasons for wanting to get into astronomy research are my curiosity and desire for knowledge , not wealth .
however i ca n't do this for nothing .
perhaps we should ask how much prof mason earns for leading stfc .
surely serving your country should n't be about the money ?
tim coveney , hull uk the really stupid aspect of the decisions was that previous funding of millions of pounds had gone into developing capital facilities like emerlin only for them to be stopped. emerlin is due to come on stream this year but for a cost of 1/3 an england football manager we will lose any benefit from the millions spent over the last few years - this is called sensible planning !
ros , renfrewshire as a physicist -lrb- and " part time " astrophyz -rrb- i feel very disappointed by the sudden cuts in funding .
i fear that the lack of funding could be a major set back and that the position of the uk will suffer eventually .
space technology has been providing jobs for many , and advances in science and technology do not come only from the bio / chemistry part .
may i add that i have nothing against biologists or chemists .
nuclear power is bound to take more importance if we want clean energy .
how can we do it if research , and training at the grassroots levels are impeded ?
when i learnt of the closing of reading university 's physics department , i felt betrayed .
the other critical problem for the lack of funding will be the lack of jobs for fresh graduates and postgrads leading highly skilled worker seeking jobs abroad .
very bad for uk 's economy .
kim vignitchouk , guildford britain is one of the richest countries in the world and our science research is world class .
i 'm disgusted that the government can not be bothered to provide the funding required .
this research could benefit the whole of mankind and i find it incredible that it is treated with such disrespect by the government .
albert leach , southampton , hampshire , uk has anyone noticed ?
it 's the countries that invest heavily in science and technology education and research that are the wealthiest and happiest ?
what does uk do ?
close university chemistry departments and fund art galleries and theatre groups .
michael papworth , evesham i was funded by pparc -lrb- the predecessor of stfc -rrb- to study my astrophysics phd and i am appalled by the continuing stories of cuts and projects under threat .
fundamental physics research is so important to the uk - not just economically but also culturally .
this £ 80 million shortfall represents less than 0.1 % of either the nhs or social welfare budget !
why ca n't the government just write stfc a cheque ?
james steel , clitheroe , uk i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london i 'm a science teacher .

david marshall , london reading the above article it seems to me that what we do n't want is investment into research being dictated by media interest lobbying and vested interest .
the job of deciding the level of resources in the various area 's will always be contentious however , i would think that it would be important to make the decisions transparent and for changes to take place over a three to five year time frame to enable the changes in the number of research graduates needed in each area to be planned for .
there is only one thing that you can guarantee and that is the decisions will be wrong at least 30 % of the time .
i personally think to much of our research funding is being spent on particle and astro physics .
t carlin , suffolk just to make it clear the funding body have been given an 11 % rise in latest 3 yr budget by government .
mark , sheffield uk the point is ' was the government made fully aware of the impact of introducing fec during the spending review ? ' .
also short-term funding problems become long-term problems as expertise lost is not easily regained .
g burt , glasgow do we / industry make any money out of the projects , if the answer is no then it must get the chop are other eu partners doing the same or similar research if the answer is yes it must be the chop alan , morpeth in this interview professor mason comes across as being the mealy-mouthed puppet of a weasel government that is cutting science budgets , hiding behind terms like " full economic costing " , " flagships " and " visions " .
is this man a champion of the uk science or a champion of his government masters ?
alastair donald , abingdon , uk from now to the end uk will depend of usa crumbs .
gustavo mendoza , lima , peru we can waste billions of pounds on iraq and the olympics but ca n't find what is a relatively small amount of money to support our technological future .
it 's time our government woke up .
w bates , poynton , uk £ 1bn was found for the millennium dome , £ 9.3bn for the olympics , £ 100bn to bail out northern rock .
and yet £ 80m , spread over 3 years , ca n't be found to cover a science budget shortfall .
where are the government 's priorities ?
if they were truly committed to science , this money would be made available immediately ! ! !

he has been a regular commentator on the funding cuts that have thrown uk particle physics and astronomy into turmoil .
bbc science reporter paul rincon caught up with prof crowther at queen 's university belfast , which was hosting this year 's national astronomy meeting .
paul rincon : how would you describe the current status of funding of uk astronomy and particle physics ?
paul crowther : we 're talking about fundamental physics : particle physics , astronomy , space science , and nuclear physics .
there was an £ 80m shortfall in the stfc -lrb- science and technology facilities council -rrb- budget for the next three years .
and right now , we 're facing the consequences of that shortfall because we are not able to maintain the existing programme in terms of running laboratories , exploiting facilities and having access to facilities .
so there have been a number of consequences of this shortfall .
what you said about this issue pr : what are the biggest-hit programmes as a result of this shortfall and what do they do from here ?
do scientists just pack up and go home ?
pc : the stfc involves facilities , it involves technology development and it involves science .
there is a certain element that is fixed , involving commitments to subscriptions to , for example , cern -lrb- european organization for nuclear research -rrb- and esa -lrb- european space agency -rrb- .
there are other elements that involve running facilities and laboratories such as diamond -lrb- synchrotron facility -rrb- at harwell .
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible there are other elements such as providing uk involvement in ground-based and space-based telescopes - some of which are under threat .
in addition , there is the access to exploitation grants in departments of physics around the country .
right now , that is also being hit by a 25 % cut in the number of research grants across particle physics , astronomy and nuclear physics .

advertisement watch susan watts ' film on the issue from bbc newsnight pr : so why are scientists so angry ?
presumably funding must have gone up and down in the past - what 's so different about these cuts and the way they 're hitting astronomers and physicists ?
pc : " blue skies " research like astronomy and particle physics has always been up and down .
but it is the scale of the cuts and the suddenness of the cuts that has shocked the community .
the reason we 're so frustrated is that there was no warning , really , before autumn last year about the scale of the cuts .
at some level , it goes back to the way in which this blue skies research is funded .
over a year ago , it was funded through a research council called pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- which was purely astronomy and particle physics .
but that was later merged with the cclrc -lrb- council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- to produce stfc .
it is this combined research council that has - overall - had a pretty decent return from government : 13.6 % over three years is , in principle , a good return .
unfortunately , subscriptions to international commitments and the cost of running laboratories increases at greater than inflation .
astronomers got to question stfc chief keith mason in belfast astronomers ' must make case ' so the effect of this " flat cash " settlement from government has been an unprecedented impact on the ability of , for example , departments to do long-term planning in terms of staff appointments .
because the flat cash settlement does not take into account inflation , spending power is eroded over the three years .
so the research council is facing an inability to deliver on things the government and the scientists would like us to deliver on .
in addition , this new research council has had to take on board these things without the right advisory structures in place .
pr : some commentators have said that the community should have anticipated the squeeze in funding .
is that a view that you have any sympathy with ?
pc : i think there have been communication difficulties - that 's certainly true .
there has been a lack of engagement with the community from this new research council - from the management .
but if we take the blue skies research done in astronomy and particle physics - we got flat cash , as did the epsrc -lrb- engineering and physical sciences research council -rrb- which deals with applied physics .
but they have been impacted by a change of a few percent in the volume of grants and research they can carry out .
the stfc has a different structure which means it has been 25 % .
that is a big hit to take for departments in terms of their long-term planning .
the lack of communication has been the key to the community 's furore over the implementation by the research council of the settlement from government .
pr : what are the big questions astronomers want to ask keith mason , stfc 's chief executive ?
pc : the key from the astronomy perspective is that we want to get the best return for the taxpayer for the money that has gone in .
right now , because of the way in which the stfc has been set up in terms of its advisory structures of scientists , just too few scientists have been involved in the decision-making process .
so the community does n't feel involved or engaged in that process .
when times are good , then everyone 's happy .
but when times are tough , like now , we as a community need to know what the priorities are as a result of this , there has been a prioritisation of which facilities are top priority and are of lower priority , and that has been done by a very small number of scientists .
astronomers are a very disparate bunch .
some people want to study the sun in detail , some want to carry out a mission to mars , others want to study galaxies from space or planets from the ground .
so we all have our own bits of kit we want .
when you have so few scientists on those panels deciding on those prioritisations , even with their best efforts , it has been impossible for the community to feel as if the best use of taxpayers ' money has been made .
it 's really down to getting the most cost-effective return for the money that is available .
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible .
up until now , there has been a lack of confidence from the community in whether the stfc has made the best use of the money we have .
so there was a ranking of facilities and - to give stfc their due - they had a three-week consultation period .
it was short , but nevertheless it went ahead .
now there are small panels deciding on whether they agree or do not agree on the prioritisation that was done by this advisory structure .
pr : so what can we expect from those panels ?
pc : the small panels will be feeding back the community response to the advisory structures in the stfc .
those are going to be responding in the next few weeks .
thereafter , there will be a period of trying to implement those with the fixed amount of money they have .
so we think that by the beginning of july , they will be in a position to say which facilities are to stay and which ones will not .
the concerns many people have is that a lot of the programmes which the uk is leading and will benefit uk scientists in the next five years are in the bottom half of the prioritisation .
some of the things which are in the top half , while addressing fundamental questions , are not where the uk is leading .
they are where the uk is buying into some component .
certain projects , such as emerlin and astrogrid - where the uk has taken a lead - are brand new , just out of the box , yet are facing immediate closure .
pr : there seems to be a real disconnect between the projects that look set to receive continued funding and those which the community thinks should receive continued funding .
are there any patterns that can be teased from the prioritisation ?
has , for example , space exploration fared better than astronomy ?
pc : clearly , the research council has a science and technology strategy .
but the community has n't , as yet , been told what that is .
but it certainly involves things like increased involvement in the space exploration programme through esa .
and that 's a means of the uk securing an esa science centre at harwell in oxfordshire .
and space exploration is a good thing .
the closure of emerlin would hit the jodrell bank facility in cheshire but the concern is that everything else is being squeezed because of that strategy .
therefore , science at some level is at a lower tier than the strategy of the research council .
i think what would be great would be to have a space exploration programme as well as an astronomy and particle physics blue skies programme .

pr : lastly , where do you think this could lead in terms of future uk astronomy and particle physics capability ?
what effect is this going to have , for example , on the numbers of young people coming into science ?
pc : clearly , the government has made it clear that they want to make science in universities more directly beneficial to the economy in the short term .

but the concern is that it is particle physics and astronomy that really motivates students towards doing science - especially physics - at university .
the signals that are being sent out right now are negative ones towards fundamental physics and blue skies research .

he has been a regular commentator on the funding cuts that have thrown uk particle physics and astronomy into turmoil .
bbc science reporter paul rincon caught up with prof crowther at queen 's university belfast , which was hosting this year 's national astronomy meeting .
paul rincon : how would you describe the current status of funding of uk astronomy and particle physics ?
paul crowther : we 're talking about fundamental physics : particle physics , astronomy , space science , and nuclear physics .
there was an £ 80m shortfall in the stfc -lrb- science and technology facilities council -rrb- budget for the next three years .
and right now , we 're facing the consequences of that shortfall because we are not able to maintain the existing programme in terms of running laboratories , exploiting facilities and having access to facilities .
so there have been a number of consequences of this shortfall .
what you said about this issue pr : what are the biggest-hit programmes as a result of this shortfall and what do they do from here ?
do scientists just pack up and go home ?
pc : the stfc involves facilities , it involves technology development and it involves science .
there is a certain element that is fixed , involving commitments to subscriptions to , for example , cern -lrb- european organization for nuclear research -rrb- and esa -lrb- european space agency -rrb- .
there are other elements that involve running facilities and laboratories such as diamond -lrb- synchrotron facility -rrb- at harwell .
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible there are other elements such as providing uk involvement in ground-based and space-based telescopes - some of which are under threat .
in addition , there is the access to exploitation grants in departments of physics around the country .
right now , that is also being hit by a 25 % cut in the number of research grants across particle physics , astronomy and nuclear physics .

advertisement watch susan watts ' film on the issue from bbc newsnight pr : so why are scientists so angry ?
presumably funding must have gone up and down in the past - what 's so different about these cuts and the way they 're hitting astronomers and physicists ?
pc : " blue skies " research like astronomy and particle physics has always been up and down .
but it is the scale of the cuts and the suddenness of the cuts that has shocked the community .
the reason we 're so frustrated is that there was no warning , really , before autumn last year about the scale of the cuts .
at some level , it goes back to the way in which this blue skies research is funded .
over a year ago , it was funded through a research council called pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- which was purely astronomy and particle physics .
but that was later merged with the cclrc -lrb- council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- to produce stfc .
it is this combined research council that has - overall - had a pretty decent return from government : 13.6 % over three years is , in principle , a good return .
unfortunately , subscriptions to international commitments and the cost of running laboratories increases at greater than inflation .
astronomers got to question stfc chief keith mason in belfast astronomers ' must make case ' so the effect of this " flat cash " settlement from government has been an unprecedented impact on the ability of , for example , departments to do long-term planning in terms of staff appointments .
because the flat cash settlement does not take into account inflation , spending power is eroded over the three years .
so the research council is facing an inability to deliver on things the government and the scientists would like us to deliver on .
in addition , this new research council has had to take on board these things without the right advisory structures in place .
pr : some commentators have said that the community should have anticipated the squeeze in funding .
is that a view that you have any sympathy with ?
pc : i think there have been communication difficulties - that 's certainly true .
there has been a lack of engagement with the community from this new research council - from the management .
but if we take the blue skies research done in astronomy and particle physics - we got flat cash , as did the epsrc -lrb- engineering and physical sciences research council -rrb- which deals with applied physics .
but they have been impacted by a change of a few percent in the volume of grants and research they can carry out .
the stfc has a different structure which means it has been 25 % .
that is a big hit to take for departments in terms of their long-term planning .
the lack of communication has been the key to the community 's furore over the implementation by the research council of the settlement from government .
pr : what are the big questions astronomers want to ask keith mason , stfc 's chief executive ?
pc : the key from the astronomy perspective is that we want to get the best return for the taxpayer for the money that has gone in .
right now , because of the way in which the stfc has been set up in terms of its advisory structures of scientists , just too few scientists have been involved in the decision-making process .
so the community does n't feel involved or engaged in that process .
when times are good , then everyone 's happy .
but when times are tough , like now , we as a community need to know what the priorities are as a result of this , there has been a prioritisation of which facilities are top priority and are of lower priority , and that has been done by a very small number of scientists .
astronomers are a very disparate bunch .
some people want to study the sun in detail , some want to carry out a mission to mars , others want to study galaxies from space or planets from the ground .
so we all have our own bits of kit we want .
when you have so few scientists on those panels deciding on those prioritisations , even with their best efforts , it has been impossible for the community to feel as if the best use of taxpayers ' money has been made .
it 's really down to getting the most cost-effective return for the money that is available .
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible .
up until now , there has been a lack of confidence from the community in whether the stfc has made the best use of the money we have .
so there was a ranking of facilities and - to give stfc their due - they had a three-week consultation period .
it was short , but nevertheless it went ahead .
now there are small panels deciding on whether they agree or do not agree on the prioritisation that was done by this advisory structure .
pr : so what can we expect from those panels ?
pc : the small panels will be feeding back the community response to the advisory structures in the stfc .
those are going to be responding in the next few weeks .
thereafter , there will be a period of trying to implement those with the fixed amount of money they have .
so we think that by the beginning of july , they will be in a position to say which facilities are to stay and which ones will not .
the concerns many people have is that a lot of the programmes which the uk is leading and will benefit uk scientists in the next five years are in the bottom half of the prioritisation .
some of the things which are in the top half , while addressing fundamental questions , are not where the uk is leading .
they are where the uk is buying into some component .
certain projects , such as emerlin and astrogrid - where the uk has taken a lead - are brand new , just out of the box , yet are facing immediate closure .
pr : there seems to be a real disconnect between the projects that look set to receive continued funding and those which the community thinks should receive continued funding .
are there any patterns that can be teased from the prioritisation ?
has , for example , space exploration fared better than astronomy ?
pc : clearly , the research council has a science and technology strategy .
but the community has n't , as yet , been told what that is .
but it certainly involves things like increased involvement in the space exploration programme through esa .
and that 's a means of the uk securing an esa science centre at harwell in oxfordshire .
and space exploration is a good thing .
the closure of emerlin would hit the jodrell bank facility in cheshire but the concern is that everything else is being squeezed because of that strategy .
therefore , science at some level is at a lower tier than the strategy of the research council .
i think what would be great would be to have a space exploration programme as well as an astronomy and particle physics blue skies programme .
but right now , there are , perhaps , too many things being squeezed into the available budget .
right now , the community feel they have n't had the strategy fully communicated to them and there has been this problem where we 've had to tease information out of government and the research councils using methods such as freedom of information act requests .
when times are good , then everyone 's happy .
but when times are tough , like now , we as a community need to know what the priorities are and what we can do to lobby government , to respond to the priorities of the research council and really get the best return for the money that the uk taxpayer puts in .
pr : lastly , where do you think this could lead in terms of future uk astronomy and particle physics capability ?
what effect is this going to have , for example , on the numbers of young people coming into science ?
pc : clearly , the government has made it clear that they want to make science in universities more directly beneficial to the economy in the short term .
and i think that is the right strategy .
but the concern is that it is particle physics and astronomy that really motivates students towards doing science - especially physics - at university .
the signals that are being sent out right now are negative ones towards fundamental physics and blue skies research .
in the long-term , if you want to have a knowledge-based economy , and a scientifically literate country , then you need to invest - at a relatively modest level compared to other areas of science - in fundamental science , to get students into the system .
once they 're in they find out about amazing things going on in applied physics .
but it is things like astronomy that get students into studying science at university .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with stfc chief executive , prof keith mason .
having close links with daresbury lab in cheshire i am personally seeing the impact this is having on the morale of the staff and scientists .
this facility is fantastic and if you had attended any of the open days which they hold for the staff , their families and the local schools you would really see what motivates children to go and study science .
removing this kind of hands on access to science will damage our science capability for generations to come .
the cuts are very shortsighted .
science is an essential part to every day life without it how would you drive to work in a morning , heat the water to make a brew or find cures for cancer .
lisa j cordwell , irlam the stfc chief exec is quoted here as asserting " we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini . "
compare this to the stfc press release of 15th november : " the stfc informed the board that the stfc , in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond , is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory . "
is it any wonder there was " a bit of a misunderstanding " ?
paul crowther 's www page includes a good summary of contradictory statements from stfc on this issue .
russell smith , durham there is more than a little irony in keith mason laying the blame for astronomy 's current funding problems on the introduction of full economic costing -lrb- fec -rrb- as a mechanism to make research properly sustainable .
the grant that supports astronomy research here in nottingham was scheduled for renewal last year .
we duly put in our bid for support , including the level of fec that had been calculated as appropriate for sustaining research -lrb- using an official audited process called the trac protocol -rrb- .
the grant was highly rated by the review panel , and recommended for funding , including the level of fec that we had requested .
there was then a lengthy delay as the full extent of the funding problems in stfc became apparent .
finally , the grant was announced , but in order to try and meet some of its budget shortfall , the recommended level of fec had been slashed by more than a factor of two .
consultation with other universities that had grants in for renewal this round indicates ! that they suffered comparable arbitrary cuts in the level of fec awarded .
if our experience is anything to go by , stfc is not spending its new money on anything like the level of fec required to sustain a research programme .
michael merrifield , professor of astronomy , university of nottingham , nottingham i found keith mason 's response to the question about students wondering if it was worth staying in astronomy to be quite insulting .
i am approaching the end of a four year masters degree in physics and astrophysics and have been planning to do a phd in some are of space research .
the reason i , like other students , am worried by the cuts is not that i feel i wo n't make money but that the cuts will make it harder for me to find a job at all !
it is the nature of the economy the stfc claims to be supporting that you need to make money to survive .
i know that a research career in astronomy will never make me a millionaire .
if i wanted to make money then i would work in the city where physics degrees are in high demand .
my reasons for wanting to get into astronomy research are my curiosity and desire for knowledge , not wealth .
however i ca n't do this for nothing .
perhaps we should ask how much prof mason earns for leading stfc .
surely serving your country should n't be about the money ?
tim coveney , hull uk the really stupid aspect of the decisions was that previous funding of millions of pounds had gone into developing capital facilities like emerlin only for them to be stopped. emerlin is due to come on stream this year but for a cost of 1/3 an england football manager we will lose any benefit from the millions spent over the last few years - this is called sensible planning !
ros , renfrewshire as a physicist -lrb- and " part time " astrophyz -rrb- i feel very disappointed by the sudden cuts in funding .
i fear that the lack of funding could be a major set back and that the position of the uk will suffer eventually .
space technology has been providing jobs for many , and advances in science and technology do not come only from the bio / chemistry part .
may i add that i have nothing against biologists or chemists .
nuclear power is bound to take more importance if we want clean energy .
how can we do it if research , and training at the grassroots levels are impeded ?
when i learnt of the closing of reading university 's physics department , i felt betrayed .
the other critical problem for the lack of funding will be the lack of jobs for fresh graduates and postgrads leading highly skilled worker seeking jobs abroad .
very bad for uk 's economy .
kim vignitchouk , guildford britain is one of the richest countries in the world and our science research is world class .
i 'm disgusted that the government can not be bothered to provide the funding required .
this research could benefit the whole of mankind and i find it incredible that it is treated with such disrespect by the government .
albert leach , southampton , hampshire , uk has anyone noticed ?
it 's the countries that invest heavily in science and technology education and research that are the wealthiest and happiest ?
what does uk do ?
close university chemistry departments and fund art galleries and theatre groups .
michael papworth , evesham i was funded by pparc -lrb- the predecessor of stfc -rrb- to study my astrophysics phd and i am appalled by the continuing stories of cuts and projects under threat .
fundamental physics research is so important to the uk - not just economically but also culturally .
this £ 80 million shortfall represents less than 0.1 % of either the nhs or social welfare budget !
why ca n't the government just write stfc a cheque ?
james steel , clitheroe , uk i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london i 'm a science teacher .

what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london reading the above article it seems to me that what we do n't want is investment into research being dictated by media interest lobbying and vested interest .
the job of deciding the level of resources in the various area 's will always be contentious however , i would think that it would be important to make the decisions transparent and for changes to take place over a three to five year time frame to enable the changes in the number of research graduates needed in each area to be planned for .
there is only one thing that you can guarantee and that is the decisions will be wrong at least 30 % of the time .
i personally think to much of our research funding is being spent on particle and astro physics .
t carlin , suffolk just to make it clear the funding body have been given an 11 % rise in latest 3 yr budget by government .
mark , sheffield uk the point is ' was the government made fully aware of the impact of introducing fec during the spending review ? ' .
also short-term funding problems become long-term problems as expertise lost is not easily regained .

so there was a ranking of facilities and - to give stfc their due - they had a three-week consultation period .
it was short , but nevertheless it went ahead .
now there are small panels deciding on whether they agree or do not agree on the prioritisation that was done by this advisory structure .
pr : so what can we expect from those panels ?
pc : the small panels will be feeding back the community response to the advisory structures in the stfc .
those are going to be responding in the next few weeks .
thereafter , there will be a period of trying to implement those with the fixed amount of money they have .
so we think that by the beginning of july , they will be in a position to say which facilities are to stay and which ones will not .
the concerns many people have is that a lot of the programmes which the uk is leading and will benefit uk scientists in the next five years are in the bottom half of the prioritisation .
some of the things which are in the top half , while addressing fundamental questions , are not where the uk is leading .
they are where the uk is buying into some component .
certain projects , such as emerlin and astrogrid - where the uk has taken a lead - are brand new , just out of the box , yet are facing immediate closure .
pr : there seems to be a real disconnect between the projects that look set to receive continued funding and those which the community thinks should receive continued funding .
are there any patterns that can be teased from the prioritisation ?
has , for example , space exploration fared better than astronomy ?
pc : clearly , the research council has a science and technology strategy .
but the community has n't , as yet , been told what that is .
but it certainly involves things like increased involvement in the space exploration programme through esa .
and that 's a means of the uk securing an esa science centre at harwell in oxfordshire .
and space exploration is a good thing .
the closure of emerlin would hit the jodrell bank facility in cheshire but the concern is that everything else is being squeezed because of that strategy .
therefore , science at some level is at a lower tier than the strategy of the research council .
i think what would be great would be to have a space exploration programme as well as an astronomy and particle physics blue skies programme .
but right now , there are , perhaps , too many things being squeezed into the available budget .
right now , the community feel they have n't had the strategy fully communicated to them and there has been this problem where we 've had to tease information out of government and the research councils using methods such as freedom of information act requests .
when times are good , then everyone 's happy .
but when times are tough , like now , we as a community need to know what the priorities are and what we can do to lobby government , to respond to the priorities of the research council and really get the best return for the money that the uk taxpayer puts in .
pr : lastly , where do you think this could lead in terms of future uk astronomy and particle physics capability ?
what effect is this going to have , for example , on the numbers of young people coming into science ?
pc : clearly , the government has made it clear that they want to make science in universities more directly beneficial to the economy in the short term .
and i think that is the right strategy .
but the concern is that it is particle physics and astronomy that really motivates students towards doing science - especially physics - at university .
the signals that are being sent out right now are negative ones towards fundamental physics and blue skies research .
in the long-term , if you want to have a knowledge-based economy , and a scientifically literate country , then you need to invest - at a relatively modest level compared to other areas of science - in fundamental science , to get students into the system .
once they 're in they find out about amazing things going on in applied physics .
but it is things like astronomy that get students into studying science at university .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with stfc chief executive , prof keith mason .
having close links with daresbury lab in cheshire i am personally seeing the impact this is having on the morale of the staff and scientists .
this facility is fantastic and if you had attended any of the open days which they hold for the staff , their families and the local schools you would really see what motivates children to go and study science .
removing this kind of hands on access to science will damage our science capability for generations to come .
the cuts are very shortsighted .
science is an essential part to every day life without it how would you drive to work in a morning , heat the water to make a brew or find cures for cancer .
lisa j cordwell , irlam the stfc chief exec is quoted here as asserting " we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini . "
compare this to the stfc press release of 15th november : " the stfc informed the board that the stfc , in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond , is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory . "
is it any wonder there was " a bit of a misunderstanding " ?
paul crowther 's www page includes a good summary of contradictory statements from stfc on this issue .
russell smith , durham there is more than a little irony in keith mason laying the blame for astronomy 's current funding problems on the introduction of full economic costing -lrb- fec -rrb- as a mechanism to make research properly sustainable .
the grant that supports astronomy research here in nottingham was scheduled for renewal last year .
we duly put in our bid for support , including the level of fec that had been calculated as appropriate for sustaining research -lrb- using an official audited process called the trac protocol -rrb- .
the grant was highly rated by the review panel , and recommended for funding , including the level of fec that we had requested .
there was then a lengthy delay as the full extent of the funding problems in stfc became apparent .
finally , the grant was announced , but in order to try and meet some of its budget shortfall , the recommended level of fec had been slashed by more than a factor of two .
consultation with other universities that had grants in for renewal this round indicates ! that they suffered comparable arbitrary cuts in the level of fec awarded .
if our experience is anything to go by , stfc is not spending its new money on anything like the level of fec required to sustain a research programme .
michael merrifield , professor of astronomy , university of nottingham , nottingham i found keith mason 's response to the question about students wondering if it was worth staying in astronomy to be quite insulting .
i am approaching the end of a four year masters degree in physics and astrophysics and have been planning to do a phd in some are of space research .
the reason i , like other students , am worried by the cuts is not that i feel i wo n't make money but that the cuts will make it harder for me to find a job at all !
it is the nature of the economy the stfc claims to be supporting that you need to make money to survive .
i know that a research career in astronomy will never make me a millionaire .
if i wanted to make money then i would work in the city where physics degrees are in high demand .
my reasons for wanting to get into astronomy research are my curiosity and desire for knowledge , not wealth .
however i ca n't do this for nothing .
perhaps we should ask how much prof mason earns for leading stfc .
surely serving your country should n't be about the money ?
tim coveney , hull uk the really stupid aspect of the decisions was that previous funding of millions of pounds had gone into developing capital facilities like emerlin only for them to be stopped. emerlin is due to come on stream this year but for a cost of 1/3 an england football manager we will lose any benefit from the millions spent over the last few years - this is called sensible planning !
ros , renfrewshire as a physicist -lrb- and " part time " astrophyz -rrb- i feel very disappointed by the sudden cuts in funding .
i fear that the lack of funding could be a major set back and that the position of the uk will suffer eventually .
space technology has been providing jobs for many , and advances in science and technology do not come only from the bio / chemistry part .
may i add that i have nothing against biologists or chemists .
nuclear power is bound to take more importance if we want clean energy .
how can we do it if research , and training at the grassroots levels are impeded ?
when i learnt of the closing of reading university 's physics department , i felt betrayed .
the other critical problem for the lack of funding will be the lack of jobs for fresh graduates and postgrads leading highly skilled worker seeking jobs abroad .
very bad for uk 's economy .
kim vignitchouk , guildford britain is one of the richest countries in the world and our science research is world class .
i 'm disgusted that the government can not be bothered to provide the funding required .
this research could benefit the whole of mankind and i find it incredible that it is treated with such disrespect by the government .
albert leach , southampton , hampshire , uk has anyone noticed ?
it 's the countries that invest heavily in science and technology education and research that are the wealthiest and happiest ?
what does uk do ?
close university chemistry departments and fund art galleries and theatre groups .
michael papworth , evesham i was funded by pparc -lrb- the predecessor of stfc -rrb- to study my astrophysics phd and i am appalled by the continuing stories of cuts and projects under threat .
fundamental physics research is so important to the uk - not just economically but also culturally .
this £ 80 million shortfall represents less than 0.1 % of either the nhs or social welfare budget !
why ca n't the government just write stfc a cheque ?
james steel , clitheroe , uk i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london i 'm a science teacher .

david marshall , london reading the above article it seems to me that what we do n't want is investment into research being dictated by media interest lobbying and vested interest .
the job of deciding the level of resources in the various area 's will always be contentious however , i would think that it would be important to make the decisions transparent and for changes to take place over a three to five year time frame to enable the changes in the number of research graduates needed in each area to be planned for .
there is only one thing that you can guarantee and that is the decisions will be wrong at least 30 % of the time .
i personally think to much of our research funding is being spent on particle and astro physics .
t carlin , suffolk just to make it clear the funding body have been given an 11 % rise in latest 3 yr budget by government .
mark , sheffield uk the point is ' was the government made fully aware of the impact of introducing fec during the spending review ? ' .
also short-term funding problems become long-term problems as expertise lost is not easily regained .
g burt , glasgow do we / industry make any money out of the projects , if the answer is no then it must get the chop are other eu partners doing the same or similar research if the answer is yes it must be the chop alan , morpeth in this interview professor mason comes across as being the mealy-mouthed puppet of a weasel government that is cutting science budgets , hiding behind terms like " full economic costing " , " flagships " and " visions " .
is this man a champion of the uk science or a champion of his government masters ?
alastair donald , abingdon , uk from now to the end uk will depend of usa crumbs .
gustavo mendoza , lima , peru we can waste billions of pounds on iraq and the olympics but ca n't find what is a relatively small amount of money to support our technological future .
it 's time our government woke up .
w bates , poynton , uk £ 1bn was found for the millennium dome , £ 9.3bn for the olympics , £ 100bn to bail out northern rock .
and yet £ 80m , spread over 3 years , ca n't be found to cover a science budget shortfall .
where are the government 's priorities ?
if they were truly committed to science , this money would be made available immediately ! ! !

he has been a regular commentator on the funding cuts that have thrown uk particle physics and astronomy into turmoil .
bbc science reporter paul rincon caught up with prof crowther at queen 's university belfast , which was hosting this year 's national astronomy meeting .
paul rincon : how would you describe the current status of funding of uk astronomy and particle physics ?
paul crowther : we 're talking about fundamental physics : particle physics , astronomy , space science , and nuclear physics .
there was an £ 80m shortfall in the stfc -lrb- science and technology facilities council -rrb- budget for the next three years .
and right now , we 're facing the consequences of that shortfall because we are not able to maintain the existing programme in terms of running laboratories , exploiting facilities and having access to facilities .
so there have been a number of consequences of this shortfall .
what you said about this issue pr : what are the biggest-hit programmes as a result of this shortfall and what do they do from here ?
do scientists just pack up and go home ?
pc : the stfc involves facilities , it involves technology development and it involves science .
there is a certain element that is fixed , involving commitments to subscriptions to , for example , cern -lrb- european organization for nuclear research -rrb- and esa -lrb- european space agency -rrb- .
there are other elements that involve running facilities and laboratories such as diamond -lrb- synchrotron facility -rrb- at harwell . "
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible " there are other elements such as providing uk involvement in ground-based and space-based telescopes - some of which are under threat .
in addition , there is the access to exploitation grants in departments of physics around the country .
right now , that is also being hit by a 25 % cut in the number of research grants across particle physics , astronomy and nuclear physics .
pr : so why are scientists so angry ?
presumably funding must have gone up and down in the past - what 's so different about these cuts and the way they 're hitting astronomers and physicists ?
pc : " blue skies " research like astronomy and particle physics has always been up and down .
but it is the scale of the cuts and the suddenness of the cuts that has shocked the community .
the reason we 're so frustrated is that there was no warning , really , before autumn last year about the scale of the cuts .
at some level , it goes back to the way in which this blue skies research is funded .
over a year ago , it was funded through a research council called pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- which was purely astronomy and particle physics .
but that was later merged with the cclrc -lrb- council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- to produce stfc .
it is this combined research council that has - overall - had a pretty decent return from government : 13.6 % over three years is , in principle , a good return .
unfortunately , subscriptions to international commitments and the cost of running laboratories increases at greater than inflation .
astronomers got to question stfc chief keith mason in belfast astronomers ' must make case ' so the effect of this " flat cash " settlement from government has been an unprecedented impact on the ability of , for example , departments to do long-term planning in terms of staff appointments .
because the flat cash settlement does not take into account inflation , spending power is eroded over the three years .
so the research council is facing an inability to deliver on things the government and the scientists would like us to deliver on .
in addition , this new research council has had to take on board these things without the right advisory structures in place .
pr : some commentators have said that the community should have anticipated the squeeze in funding .
is that a view that you have any sympathy with ?
pc : i think there have been communication difficulties - that 's certainly true .
there has been a lack of engagement with the community from this new research council - from the management .
but if we take the blue skies research done in astronomy and particle physics - we got flat cash , as did the epsrc -lrb- engineering and physical sciences research council -rrb- which deals with applied physics .
but they have been impacted by a change of a few percent in the volume of grants and research they can carry out .
the stfc has a different structure which means it has been 25 % .
that is a big hit to take for departments in terms of their long-term planning .
the lack of communication has been the key to the community 's furore over the implementation by the research council of the settlement from government .
pr : what are the big questions astronomers want to ask keith mason , stfc 's chief executive ?
pc : the key from the astronomy perspective is that we want to get the best return for the taxpayer for the money that has gone in .
right now , because of the way in which the stfc has been set up in terms of its advisory structures of scientists , just too few scientists have been involved in the decision-making process .
so the community does n't feel involved or engaged in that process . "
when times are good , then everyone 's happy .
but when times are tough , like now , we as a community need to know what the priorities are " as a result of this , there has been a prioritisation of which facilities are top priority and are of lower priority , and that has been done by a very small number of scientists .
astronomers are a very disparate bunch .
some people want to study the sun in detail , some want to carry out a mission to mars , others want to study galaxies from space or planets from the ground .
so we all have our own bits of kit we want .
when you have so few scientists on those panels deciding on those prioritisations , even with their best efforts , it has been impossible for the community to feel as if the best use of taxpayers ' money has been made .
it 's really down to getting the most cost-effective return for the money that is available .
when you have limited money , you really need to perform that juggling act as carefully as possible .
up until now , there has been a lack of confidence from the community in whether the stfc has made the best use of the money we have .
so there was a ranking of facilities and - to give stfc their due - they had a three-week consultation period .
it was short , but nevertheless it went ahead .
now there are small panels deciding on whether they agree or do not agree on the prioritisation that was done by this advisory structure .
pr : so what can we expect from those panels ?
pc : the small panels will be feeding back the community response to the advisory structures in the stfc .
those are going to be responding in the next few weeks .
thereafter , there will be a period of trying to implement those with the fixed amount of money they have .
so we think that by the beginning of july , they will be in a position to say which facilities are to stay and which ones will not .
the concerns many people have is that a lot of the programmes which the uk is leading and will benefit uk scientists in the next five years are in the bottom half of the prioritisation .
some of the things which are in the top half , while addressing fundamental questions , are not where the uk is leading .

what effect is this going to have , for example , on the numbers of young people coming into science ?

the stfc has been embroiled in a storm of criticism over cuts to its science portfolio .
bbc news science reporter paul rincon interviewed professor mason in belfast , where he was preparing to address astronomers gathered for their annual meeting .
paul rincon : have you been surprised by the strength and organisation of the opposition to cuts proposed by the stfc ?
professor keith mason : well , i think one has to first of all recognise why we 're having to make economies in certain areas of our programmes .
that 's because there is a restructuring of the way science is funded in the uk .
there is more money going into science ; but we had a situation up until very recently where the university research base in particular was not sustainable .
what you said about this issue the fabric of university buildings , for example , was deteriorating and nobody was paying for them .
we are changing that .
we 're going to an era of full economic costing .
we 're putting a lot more money into universities for the research they 're doing .
this unfortunately means that is taking up the new money in the short term ; but it will be worth it in the end . "
these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront " so we 're in a situation where , after the full economic costing revolution - and it is a real revolution - that the university research base will be sustainable .
we will be able to maintain the cutting edge .
and then we 'll be able to start growing our programme again .
but the situation we 're in now is that we are having to make some economies .
and let 's not overstate the size of the economies - it 's £ 30m a year on a £ 400m programme .
we have to make some economies in the short term in order to put the research on a sustainable basis in the long-term .
pr : there has been come criticism that in trying to fund some of the more applied science programmes with , perhaps , more potential economic benefit , you are cutting basic research which feeds into and supports those applied areas .
is any of that criticism justified ?
km : i think there is a fundamental misunderstanding there .
we 're not cutting pure research in order to do applied research .
everything we do has a very high " blue skies " content - it 's in the nature of what we do .
this is not the issue at all .
quite the contrary .
the issue is simply to put the research base on a sustainable basis .
our line is we need to do more research , more pure research , more fundamental research , because that 's where the real advances come and then they feed into the economy on timescales that can be quite short , but is often very long .
and we need to recognise that there 's that spectrum of response as well .
but what we need to do differently is , first of all , we must not stop scientists from doing pure research .
we do not want to turn scientists into salesmen .
quite the contrary .
we want to leave scientists doing what they do best , which is the research .
but we must put in mechanisms to capture that research and capture the ideas - and there are many of those that we are not using - to capture those much more effectively , so that we can benefit the economy .
and if we can benefit the economy , we can afford to invest more in research , so everybody wins .
pr : i wanted to ask about the gemini telescopes .
some observers have seen that as a bit of a flip-flop by stfc , where you were in and then you were out .
what is the current status there ?
km : again , we have had a consistent line here .
there has been some misunderstanding over gemini .
we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini .
the issue with gemini is the re-equipment of the instrument base for gemini .
we are currently in gemini until 2012 , but the new instruments do n't come online until 2014 , 2015 .
so we needed to have a debate about whether we should pay for those instruments because if we 're not going to stay in gemini beyond 2012 then clearly it 's not sensible to be paying for instrumentation that you do n't use .
but i think this did lead to a bit of a misunderstanding with our international partners .
that is all very unfortunate .
but it 's all water under the bridge now , we 've sorted that one out . "
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here " these things do happen occasionally , and they 're not at all unusual .
but our line has been consistent .
we do need to understand how we 're going to take our partnership with gemini into the future , or whether there are other things we need to invest in in terms of , for example , building extremely large telescopes through the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- route .
we have to define a strategy over the next year or so .
and that will be a forward-looking strategy which needs to be affordable .
of course , there is no point in having a strategy that 's not affordable .
but we will be doing that and we will be talking to people about what the requirements are : when do we need a 30m telescope ? and do we need it sooner rather than later ?
and if we need it sooner rather than later then we have to stop doing something else in order to accelerate the development of that .
but these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront .
pr : it must be unprecedented that the royal astronomical society -lsb- council -rsb- expressed a lack of confidence in stfc 's handling of the situation .
what are you doing to reassure the scientific community and respond to their criticisms of stfc decisions ?
km : well i think the origin of some of the criticisms is the fact that we are a new research council .
we have a much wider remit than the predecessors to stfc and the astronomy and particle physics communities have been used to having - over the last 13 years - with their own research council in pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- .
now that activity is embedded in a larger entity .
i believe people were naturally suspicious of the motivation for the merger -lrb- pparc with cclrc , council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- - whether that meant there was going to be a downplaying of astronomy and particle physics .
as a result of that , they 've been very focused on every action we 've taken .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here .
particle physics and astronomy is incredibly important .
we believe it is important .
we will continue to push for that area of science , alongside our other wider responsibilities .
i think one of the big advantages of the new research council with its broader base is that we can exploit the synergies between research areas more effectively .
interdisciplinary research - that 's where the big gains are .
we 've got to get people out of their silos and thinking in broader terms .
for example , the same technology we need to build a very large telescope is the same type of optics we need to possibly build a workable nuclear fusion generator that might address the world 's energy needs .
that kind of technology cross-talk between various areas is incredibly important .
we need to take advantage of that and that 's what we 're seeking to do .
pr : why has the " flat cash settlement " hit stfc so hard ?
could anything have been done differently - at a government departmental level perhaps - to improve things ?
km : the flat cash in the research councils is something that is affecting all the research councils .
the reason is that the new money - and there is lots of new money going into research - is going to make the research sustainable through full economic costing .
it particularly hits the stfc , perhaps , more than some other research councils , because our programmes are long-term . "
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme . "
other research councils can get by through just awarding fewer grants - by starting fewer new activities , because they tend to fund things on a short timescale .
at stfc , our programmes are long-term - lasting 15 or 20 years in some cases .
and the only way to cope with the erosive effect of inflation which reduces the amount we can do is to stop things - and that 's painful .
it 's natural that people who are working on facilities that need to be discontinued get upset - i would if i was them .
so some of the reaction is , perhaps , understandable .
but we are where we have a finite budget .
we have to use it in the most effective way and we ca n't fund everything .
we have many more new ideas than we can possibly ever fund .
pr : there have been recent reports in the media that jodrell bank in cheshire could be threatened by cuts to its programmes .
can you reassure people that it will stay open ?
km : firstly , whether jodrell bank stays open is a matter for manchester university not us , because we do n't own it .
the issue that has been discussed in the press , particularly , revolves around funding of emerlin .
we had some advice from an independent group of scientists which rated emerlin as being in the lower priority category .
but when we released that prioritisation , we put a rider on it saying that the stfc council recognised that there were wider strategic issues involved here .
and this is the case .
one of the other things in our prioritisation is the square kilometre array -lrb- ska -rrb- , which is the future of radio astronomy .
that is also run out of jodrell bank and is of the very highest priority for us .
it 's something where the uk can be the world leader .
we are already leading that project out of jodrell bank in a european context .
we can take a world lead in that , provided we invest in it soon .
and the issue with emerlin is really the fact that that programme is running several years late and it means that if we continue to support that at the current level , we might not be able to start our activities in the square kilometre array at an opportune time to retain the lead .
now , that does n't mean we 're not going to fund emerlin or fund square kilometre array .
but we have to think these things through .
we have to talk to the university of manchester about how we get to where we need to be with both of these projects .
and as i said on a previous occasion , the furore in the press about jodrell bank has been very misinformed in many ways .
reports of jodrell bank 's demise are overly exaggerated , certainly .
that 's not in our mind at all .
we always have to make hard choices .
we have a long-term goal , which is the square kilometre array , and we need to understand how to get there. emerlin is part of the pathway for getting there .
but the rate at which we invest in emerlin , the rate at which we can invest in the square kilometre array - those are things we have to determine very carefully and very sensitively if we are going to get to where we want to be .
pr : the head of the cockcroft institute -lrb- the uk 's new accelerator science centre -rrb- recently said daresbury laboratory , also in cheshire , could close if certain programmes there are cut .
what would you say to people about the future of those two sites ?
km : daresbury is one of our flagship science and innovation campuses .
and the key thing is : science and innovation .
they are both important .
daresbury has been going through a low recently because of the closure of the synchrotron radiation source -lrb- srs -rrb- .
the new synchrotron radiation source -lrb- diamond -rrb- has been built at harwell -lrb- oxfordshire -rrb- , which was a decision made many years ago .
but it is only now we are getting to the point where srs actually closes and clearly that causes some problems - some distress .
we 're having to make some people redundant as a result .
but the future of daresbury is something we 're working very hard to secure .
our vision for daresbury is a science base which is much broader than one based just on synchrotron sources .
that 's what we 're working towards and we 'll be making announcements in the next few months to put meat on those bones .
but i 'm clear in my mind that daresbury is already a very successful site .
we were there with -lrb- science minister -rrb- ian pearson -lrb- on 3 april -rrb- , opening a new innovation centre and the buzz around it was just incredible - very , very positive .
daresbury is going places , scientifically as well as on the innovation front .
it will be one of our flagships .
we 're pushing it as hard as we can .
it will be a fantastic place to be .
pr : lastly , what 's your prognosis for uk particle physics and astronomy over coming years ?
km : with the advent of full economic costing , there 's actually a lot more money going into uk physics and astronomy - into the university system - than there was a few years ago .
and it is creating a sustainable base which will stand us in good stead for the future .
it 's very important and i 'm going to keep pushing it .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
we have new facilities coming online yearly .
we have alma -lrb- the atacama large millimetre array -rrb- coming online .
i just got a message from our people in hawaii a couple of days ago that the scuba 2 camera is now being put into the jcmt -lrb- james clerk maxwell telescope -rrb- dome .
this is a world-leading technology that will keep the uk at the forefront of sub-millimetre astronomy .
it 's incredibly exciting .
there are lots and lots of things to look forward to and i 'm incredibly enthusiastic about it .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with sheffield university 's prof paul crowther .
having close links with daresbury lab in cheshire i am personally seeing the impact this is having on the morale of the staff and scientists .
this facility is fantastic and if you had attended any of the open days which they hold for the staff , their families and the local schools you would really see what motivates children to go and study science .
removing this kind of hands on access to science will damage our science capability for generations to come .
the cuts are very shortsighted .
science is an essential part to every day life without it how would you drive to work in a morning , heat the water to make a brew or find cures for cancer .
lisa j cordwell , irlam the stfc chief exec is quoted here as asserting " we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini . "
compare this to the stfc press release of 15th november : " the stfc informed the board that the stfc , in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond , is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory . "
is it any wonder there was " a bit of a misunderstanding " ?
paul crowther 's www page includes a good summary of contradictory statements from stfc on this issue .
russell smith , durham there is more than a little irony in keith mason laying the blame for astronomy 's current funding problems on the introduction of full economic costing -lrb- fec -rrb- as a mechanism to make research properly sustainable .
the grant that supports astronomy research here in nottingham was scheduled for renewal last year .
we duly put in our bid for support , including the level of fec that had been calculated as appropriate for sustaining research -lrb- using an official audited process called the trac protocol -rrb- .
the grant was highly rated by the review panel , and recommended for funding , including the level of fec that we had requested .
there was then a lengthy delay as the full extent of the funding problems in stfc became apparent .
finally , the grant was announced , but in order to try and meet some of its budget shortfall , the recommended level of fec had been slashed by more than a factor of two .
consultation with other universities that had grants in for renewal this round indicates ! that they suffered comparable arbitrary cuts in the level of fec awarded .
if our experience is anything to go by , stfc is not spending its new money on anything like the level of fec required to sustain a research programme .
michael merrifield , professor of astronomy , university of nottingham , nottingham i found keith mason 's response to the question about students wondering if it was worth staying in astronomy to be quite insulting .
i am approaching the end of a four year masters degree in physics and astrophysics and have been planning to do a phd in some are of space research .
the reason i , like other students , am worried by the cuts is not that i feel i wo n't make money but that the cuts will make it harder for me to find a job at all !
it is the nature of the economy the stfc claims to be supporting that you need to make money to survive .
i know that a research career in astronomy will never make me a millionaire .
if i wanted to make money then i would work in the city where physics degrees are in high demand .
my reasons for wanting to get into astronomy research are my curiosity and desire for knowledge , not wealth .
however i ca n't do this for nothing .
perhaps we should ask how much prof mason earns for leading stfc .
surely serving your country should n't be about the money ?
tim coveney , hull uk the really stupid aspect of the decisions was that previous funding of millions of pounds had gone into developing capital facilities like emerlin only for them to be stopped. emerlin is due to come on stream this year but for a cost of 1/3 an england football manager we will lose any benefit from the millions spent over the last few years - this is called sensible planning !
ros , renfrewshire as a physicist -lrb- and " part time " astrophyz -rrb- i feel very disappointed by the sudden cuts in funding .
i fear that the lack of funding could be a major set back and that the position of the uk will suffer eventually .
space technology has been providing jobs for many , and advances in science and technology do not come only from the bio / chemistry part .
may i add that i have nothing against biologists or chemists .
nuclear power is bound to take more importance if we want clean energy .
how can we do it if research , and training at the grassroots levels are impeded ?
when i learnt of the closing of reading university 's physics department , i felt betrayed .
the other critical problem for the lack of funding will be the lack of jobs for fresh graduates and postgrads leading highly skilled worker seeking jobs abroad .
very bad for uk 's economy .
kim vignitchouk , guildford britain is one of the richest countries in the world and our science research is world class .
i 'm disgusted that the government can not be bothered to provide the funding required .
this research could benefit the whole of mankind and i find it incredible that it is treated with such disrespect by the government .
albert leach , southampton , hampshire , uk has anyone noticed ?
it 's the countries that invest heavily in science and technology education and research that are the wealthiest and happiest ?
what does uk do ?
close university chemistry departments and fund art galleries and theatre groups .
michael papworth , evesham i was funded by pparc -lrb- the predecessor of stfc -rrb- to study my astrophysics phd and i am appalled by the continuing stories of cuts and projects under threat .
fundamental physics research is so important to the uk - not just economically but also culturally .
this £ 80 million shortfall represents less than 0.1 % of either the nhs or social welfare budget !
why ca n't the government just write stfc a cheque ?
james steel , clitheroe , uk i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london reading the above article it seems to me that what we do n't want is investment into research being dictated by media interest lobbying and vested interest .
the job of deciding the level of resources in the various area 's will always be contentious however , i would think that it would be important to make the decisions transparent and for changes to take place over a three to five year time frame to enable the changes in the number of research graduates needed in each area to be planned for .
there is only one thing that you can guarantee and that is the decisions will be wrong at least 30 % of the time .
i personally think to much of our research funding is being spent on particle and astro physics .
t carlin , suffolk just to make it clear the funding body have been given an 11 % rise in latest 3 yr budget by government .
mark , sheffield uk the point is ' was the government made fully aware of the impact of introducing fec during the spending review ? ' .
also short-term funding problems become long-term problems as expertise lost is not easily regained .
g burt , glasgow do we / industry make any money out of the projects , if the answer is no then it must get the chop are other eu partners doing the same or similar research if the answer is yes it must be the chop alan , morpeth in this interview professor mason comes across as being the mealy-mouthed puppet of a weasel government that is cutting science budgets , hiding behind terms like " full economic costing " , " flagships " and " visions " .
is this man a champion of the uk science or a champion of his government masters ?
alastair donald , abingdon , uk from now to the end uk will depend of usa crumbs .
gustavo mendoza , lima , peru we can waste billions of pounds on iraq and the olympics but ca n't find what is a relatively small amount of money to support our technological future .
it 's time our government woke up .
w bates , poynton , uk £ 1bn was found for the millennium dome , £ 9.3bn for the olympics , £ 100bn to bail out northern rock .
and yet £ 80m , spread over 3 years , ca n't be found to cover a science budget shortfall .
where are the government 's priorities ?

we do need to understand how we 're going to take our partnership with gemini into the future , or whether there are other things we need to invest in in terms of , for example , building extremely large telescopes through the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- route .
we have to define a strategy over the next year or so .
and that will be a forward-looking strategy which needs to be affordable .
of course , there is no point in having a strategy that 's not affordable .
but we will be doing that and we will be talking to people about what the requirements are : when do we need a 30m telescope ? and do we need it sooner rather than later ?
and if we need it sooner rather than later then we have to stop doing something else in order to accelerate the development of that .
but these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront .
pr : it must be unprecedented that the royal astronomical society -lsb- council -rsb- expressed a lack of confidence in stfc 's handling of the situation .
what are you doing to reassure the scientific community and respond to their criticisms of stfc decisions ?
km : well i think the origin of some of the criticisms is the fact that we are a new research council .
we have a much wider remit than the predecessors to stfc and the astronomy and particle physics communities have been used to having - over the last 13 years - with their own research council in pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- .
now that activity is embedded in a larger entity .
press coverage about jodrell bank was " misinformed " said prof mason i believe people were naturally suspicious of the motivation for the merger -lrb- pparc with cclrc , council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- - whether that meant there was going to be a downplaying of astronomy and particle physics .
as a result of that , they 've been very focused on every action we 've taken .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here .
particle physics and astronomy is incredibly important .
we believe it is important .
we will continue to push for that area of science , alongside our other wider responsibilities .
i think one of the big advantages of the new research council with its broader base is that we can exploit the synergies between research areas more effectively .
interdisciplinary research - that 's where the big gains are .
we 've got to get people out of their silos and thinking in broader terms .
for example , the same technology we need to build a very large telescope is the same type of optics we need to possibly build a workable nuclear fusion generator that might address the world 's energy needs .
that kind of technology cross-talk between various areas is incredibly important .
we need to take advantage of that and that 's what we 're seeking to do .
pr : why has the " flat cash settlement " hit stfc so hard ?
could anything have been done differently - at a government departmental level perhaps - to improve things ?
km : the flat cash in the research councils is something that is affecting all the research councils .
the reason is that the new money - and there is lots of new money going into research - is going to make the research sustainable through full economic costing .
it particularly hits the stfc , perhaps , more than some other research councils , because our programmes are long-term .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
other research councils can get by through just awarding fewer grants - by starting fewer new activities , because they tend to fund things on a short timescale .
at stfc , our programmes are long-term - lasting 15 or 20 years in some cases .
and the only way to cope with the erosive effect of inflation which reduces the amount we can do is to stop things - and that 's painful .
it 's natural that people who are working on facilities that need to be discontinued get upset - i would if i was them .
so some of the reaction is , perhaps , understandable .
but we are where we have a finite budget .
we have to use it in the most effective way and we ca n't fund everything .
we have many more new ideas than we can possibly ever fund .
pr : there have been recent reports in the media that jodrell bank in cheshire could be threatened by cuts to its programmes .
can you reassure people that it will stay open ?
km : firstly , whether jodrell bank stays open is a matter for manchester university not us , because we do n't own it .
the issue that has been discussed in the press , particularly , revolves around funding of emerlin .
we had some advice from an independent group of scientists which rated emerlin as being in the lower priority category .
but when we released that prioritisation , we put a rider on it saying that the stfc council recognised that there were wider strategic issues involved here .
and this is the case .
one of the other things in our prioritisation is the square kilometre array -lrb- ska -rrb- , which is the future of radio astronomy .
that is also run out of jodrell bank and is of the very highest priority for us .
it 's something where the uk can be the world leader .
some astronomers think their field is not being rewarded properly we are already leading that project out of jodrell bank in a european context .
we can take a world lead in that , provided we invest in it soon .
and the issue with emerlin is really the fact that that programme is running several years late and it means that if we continue to support that at the current level , we might not be able to start our activities in the square kilometre array at an opportune time to retain the lead .
now , that does n't mean we 're not going to fund emerlin or fund square kilometre array .
but we have to think these things through .
we have to talk to the university of manchester about how we get to where we need to be with both of these projects .
and as i said on a previous occasion , the furore in the press about jodrell bank has been very misinformed in many ways .
reports of jodrell bank 's demise are overly exaggerated , certainly .
that 's not in our mind at all .
we always have to make hard choices .
we have a long-term goal , which is the square kilometre array , and we need to understand how to get there. emerlin is part of the pathway for getting there .
but the rate at which we invest in emerlin , the rate at which we can invest in the square kilometre array - those are things we have to determine very carefully and very sensitively if we are going to get to where we want to be .
pr : the head of the cockcroft institute -lrb- the uk 's new accelerator science centre -rrb- recently said daresbury laboratory , also in cheshire , could close if certain programmes there are cut .
what would you say to people about the future of those two sites ?
km : daresbury is one of our flagship science and innovation campuses .
and the key thing is : science and innovation .
they are both important .
daresbury has been going through a low recently because of the closure of the synchrotron radiation source -lrb- srs -rrb- .
the new synchrotron radiation source -lrb- diamond -rrb- has been built at harwell -lrb- oxfordshire -rrb- , which was a decision made many years ago .
but it is only now we are getting to the point where srs actually closes and clearly that causes some problems - some distress .
we 're having to make some people redundant as a result .
but the future of daresbury is something we 're working very hard to secure .
our vision for daresbury is a science base which is much broader than one based just on synchrotron sources .
that 's what we 're working towards and we 'll be making announcements in the next few months to put meat on those bones .
but i 'm clear in my mind that daresbury is already a very successful site .
we were there with -lrb- science minister -rrb- ian pearson -lrb- on 3 april -rrb- , opening a new innovation centre and the buzz around it was just incredible - very , very positive .
daresbury is going places , scientifically as well as on the innovation front .
it will be one of our flagships .
we 're pushing it as hard as we can .
it will be a fantastic place to be .
pr : lastly , what 's your prognosis for uk particle physics and astronomy over coming years ?
km : with the advent of full economic costing , there 's actually a lot more money going into uk physics and astronomy - into the university system - than there was a few years ago .
and it is creating a sustainable base which will stand us in good stead for the future .
it 's very important and i 'm going to keep pushing it .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
we have new facilities coming online yearly .
we have alma -lrb- the atacama large millimetre array -rrb- coming online .
i just got a message from our people in hawaii a couple of days ago that the scuba 2 camera is now being put into the jcmt -lrb- james clerk maxwell telescope -rrb- dome .
this is a world-leading technology that will keep the uk at the forefront of sub-millimetre astronomy .
it 's incredibly exciting .
there are lots and lots of things to look forward to and i 'm incredibly enthusiastic about it .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with sheffield university 's prof paul crowther .
having close links with daresbury lab in cheshire i am personally seeing the impact this is having on the morale of the staff and scientists .
this facility is fantastic and if you had attended any of the open days which they hold for the staff , their families and the local schools you would really see what motivates children to go and study science .
removing this kind of hands on access to science will damage our science capability for generations to come .
the cuts are very shortsighted .
science is an essential part to every day life without it how would you drive to work in a morning , heat the water to make a brew or find cures for cancer .
lisa j cordwell , irlam the stfc chief exec is quoted here as asserting " we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini . "
compare this to the stfc press release of 15th november : " the stfc informed the board that the stfc , in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond , is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory . "
is it any wonder there was " a bit of a misunderstanding " ?
paul crowther 's www page includes a good summary of contradictory statements from stfc on this issue .
russell smith , durham there is more than a little irony in keith mason laying the blame for astronomy 's current funding problems on the introduction of full economic costing -lrb- fec -rrb- as a mechanism to make research properly sustainable .
the grant that supports astronomy research here in nottingham was scheduled for renewal last year .
we duly put in our bid for support , including the level of fec that had been calculated as appropriate for sustaining research -lrb- using an official audited process called the trac protocol -rrb- .
the grant was highly rated by the review panel , and recommended for funding , including the level of fec that we had requested .
there was then a lengthy delay as the full extent of the funding problems in stfc became apparent .
finally , the grant was announced , but in order to try and meet some of its budget shortfall , the recommended level of fec had been slashed by more than a factor of two .
consultation with other universities that had grants in for renewal this round indicates ! that they suffered comparable arbitrary cuts in the level of fec awarded .
if our experience is anything to go by , stfc is not spending its new money on anything like the level of fec required to sustain a research programme .
michael merrifield , professor of astronomy , university of nottingham , nottingham i found keith mason 's response to the question about students wondering if it was worth staying in astronomy to be quite insulting .
i am approaching the end of a four year masters degree in physics and astrophysics and have been planning to do a phd in some are of space research .
the reason i , like other students , am worried by the cuts is not that i feel i wo n't make money but that the cuts will make it harder for me to find a job at all !
it is the nature of the economy the stfc claims to be supporting that you need to make money to survive .
i know that a research career in astronomy will never make me a millionaire .
if i wanted to make money then i would work in the city where physics degrees are in high demand .
my reasons for wanting to get into astronomy research are my curiosity and desire for knowledge , not wealth .
however i ca n't do this for nothing .
perhaps we should ask how much prof mason earns for leading stfc .
surely serving your country should n't be about the money ?
tim coveney , hull uk the really stupid aspect of the decisions was that previous funding of millions of pounds had gone into developing capital facilities like emerlin only for them to be stopped. emerlin is due to come on stream this year but for a cost of 1/3 an england football manager we will lose any benefit from the millions spent over the last few years - this is called sensible planning !
ros , renfrewshire as a physicist -lrb- and " part time " astrophyz -rrb- i feel very disappointed by the sudden cuts in funding .
i fear that the lack of funding could be a major set back and that the position of the uk will suffer eventually .
space technology has been providing jobs for many , and advances in science and technology do not come only from the bio / chemistry part .
may i add that i have nothing against biologists or chemists .
nuclear power is bound to take more importance if we want clean energy .
how can we do it if research , and training at the grassroots levels are impeded ?
when i learnt of the closing of reading university 's physics department , i felt betrayed .
the other critical problem for the lack of funding will be the lack of jobs for fresh graduates and postgrads leading highly skilled worker seeking jobs abroad .
very bad for uk 's economy .
kim vignitchouk , guildford britain is one of the richest countries in the world and our science research is world class .
i 'm disgusted that the government can not be bothered to provide the funding required .
this research could benefit the whole of mankind and i find it incredible that it is treated with such disrespect by the government .
albert leach , southampton , hampshire , uk has anyone noticed ?
it 's the countries that invest heavily in science and technology education and research that are the wealthiest and happiest ?
what does uk do ?
close university chemistry departments and fund art galleries and theatre groups .
michael papworth , evesham i was funded by pparc -lrb- the predecessor of stfc -rrb- to study my astrophysics phd and i am appalled by the continuing stories of cuts and projects under threat .
fundamental physics research is so important to the uk - not just economically but also culturally .
this £ 80 million shortfall represents less than 0.1 % of either the nhs or social welfare budget !
why ca n't the government just write stfc a cheque ?
james steel , clitheroe , uk i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london reading the above article it seems to me that what we do n't want is investment into research being dictated by media interest lobbying and vested interest .
the job of deciding the level of resources in the various area 's will always be contentious however , i would think that it would be important to make the decisions transparent and for changes to take place over a three to five year time frame to enable the changes in the number of research graduates needed in each area to be planned for .
there is only one thing that you can guarantee and that is the decisions will be wrong at least 30 % of the time .
i personally think to much of our research funding is being spent on particle and astro physics .
t carlin , suffolk just to make it clear the funding body have been given an 11 % rise in latest 3 yr budget by government .
mark , sheffield uk the point is ' was the government made fully aware of the impact of introducing fec during the spending review ? ' .
also short-term funding problems become long-term problems as expertise lost is not easily regained .
g burt , glasgow do we / industry make any money out of the projects , if the answer is no then it must get the chop are other eu partners doing the same or similar research if the answer is yes it must be the chop alan , morpeth in this interview professor mason comes across as being the mealy-mouthed puppet of a weasel government that is cutting science budgets , hiding behind terms like " full economic costing " , " flagships " and " visions " .
is this man a champion of the uk science or a champion of his government masters ?
alastair donald , abingdon , uk from now to the end uk will depend of usa crumbs .
gustavo mendoza , lima , peru we can waste billions of pounds on iraq and the olympics but ca n't find what is a relatively small amount of money to support our technological future .
it 's time our government woke up .
w bates , poynton , uk £ 1bn was found for the millennium dome , £ 9.3bn for the olympics , £ 100bn to bail out northern rock .
and yet £ 80m , spread over 3 years , ca n't be found to cover a science budget shortfall .
where are the government 's priorities ?
if they were truly committed to science , this money would be made available immediately ! ! !

the stfc has been embroiled in a storm of criticism over cuts to its science portfolio .
bbc news science reporter paul rincon interviewed professor mason in belfast , where he was preparing to address astronomers gathered for their annual meeting .
paul rincon : have you been surprised by the strength and organisation of the opposition to cuts proposed by the stfc ?
professor keith mason : well , i think one has to first of all recognise why we 're having to make economies in certain areas of our programmes .
that 's because there is a restructuring of the way science is funded in the uk .
there is more money going into science ; but we had a situation up until very recently where the university research base in particular was not sustainable .
what you said about this issue the fabric of university buildings , for example , was deteriorating and nobody was paying for them .
we are changing that .
we 're going to an era of full economic costing .
we 're putting a lot more money into universities for the research they 're doing .
this unfortunately means that is taking up the new money in the short term ; but it will be worth it in the end .
these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront so we 're in a situation where , after the full economic costing revolution - and it is a real revolution - that the university research base will be sustainable .
we will be able to maintain the cutting edge .
and then we 'll be able to start growing our programme again .
but the situation we 're in now is that we are having to make some economies .
and let 's not overstate the size of the economies - it 's £ 30m a year on a £ 400m programme .
we have to make some economies in the short term in order to put the research on a sustainable basis in the long-term .

advertisement watch susan watts ' film on the issue from bbc newsnight pr : there has been come criticism that in trying to fund some of the more applied science programmes with , perhaps , more potential economic benefit , you are cutting basic research which feeds into and supports those applied areas .
is any of that criticism justified ?
km : i think there is a fundamental misunderstanding there .
we 're not cutting pure research in order to do applied research .
everything we do has a very high " blue skies " content - it 's in the nature of what we do .
this is not the issue at all .
quite the contrary .
the issue is simply to put the research base on a sustainable basis .
our line is we need to do more research , more pure research , more fundamental research , because that 's where the real advances come and then they feed into the economy on timescales that can be quite short , but is often very long .
and we need to recognise that there 's that spectrum of response as well .
the uk has now been reinstated as a full member of gemini but what we need to do differently is , first of all , we must not stop scientists from doing pure research .
we do not want to turn scientists into salesmen .
quite the contrary .
we want to leave scientists doing what they do best , which is the research .
but we must put in mechanisms to capture that research and capture the ideas - and there are many of those that we are not using - to capture those much more effectively , so that we can benefit the economy .
and if we can benefit the economy , we can afford to invest more in research , so everybody wins .
pr : i wanted to ask about the gemini telescopes .
some observers have seen that as a bit of a flip-flop by stfc , where you were in and then you were out .
what is the current status there ?
km : again , we have had a consistent line here .
there has been some misunderstanding over gemini .
we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini .
the issue with gemini is the re-equipment of the instrument base for gemini .
we are currently in gemini until 2012 , but the new instruments do n't come online until 2014 , 2015 .
so we needed to have a debate about whether we should pay for those instruments because if we 're not going to stay in gemini beyond 2012 then clearly it 's not sensible to be paying for instrumentation that you do n't use .
but i think this did lead to a bit of a misunderstanding with our international partners .
that is all very unfortunate .
but it 's all water under the bridge now , we 've sorted that one out .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here these things do happen occasionally , and they 're not at all unusual .
but our line has been consistent .
we do need to understand how we 're going to take our partnership with gemini into the future , or whether there are other things we need to invest in in terms of , for example , building extremely large telescopes through the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- route .
we have to define a strategy over the next year or so .
and that will be a forward-looking strategy which needs to be affordable .
of course , there is no point in having a strategy that 's not affordable .
but we will be doing that and we will be talking to people about what the requirements are : when do we need a 30m telescope ? and do we need it sooner rather than later ?
and if we need it sooner rather than later then we have to stop doing something else in order to accelerate the development of that .
but these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront .
pr : it must be unprecedented that the royal astronomical society -lsb- council -rsb- expressed a lack of confidence in stfc 's handling of the situation .
what are you doing to reassure the scientific community and respond to their criticisms of stfc decisions ?
km : well i think the origin of some of the criticisms is the fact that we are a new research council .
we have a much wider remit than the predecessors to stfc and the astronomy and particle physics communities have been used to having - over the last 13 years - with their own research council in pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- .
now that activity is embedded in a larger entity .
press coverage about jodrell bank was " misinformed " said prof mason i believe people were naturally suspicious of the motivation for the merger -lrb- pparc with cclrc , council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- - whether that meant there was going to be a downplaying of astronomy and particle physics .
as a result of that , they 've been very focused on every action we 've taken .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here .
particle physics and astronomy is incredibly important .
we believe it is important .
we will continue to push for that area of science , alongside our other wider responsibilities .
i think one of the big advantages of the new research council with its broader base is that we can exploit the synergies between research areas more effectively .
interdisciplinary research - that 's where the big gains are .
we 've got to get people out of their silos and thinking in broader terms .
for example , the same technology we need to build a very large telescope is the same type of optics we need to possibly build a workable nuclear fusion generator that might address the world 's energy needs .
that kind of technology cross-talk between various areas is incredibly important .
we need to take advantage of that and that 's what we 're seeking to do .
pr : why has the " flat cash settlement " hit stfc so hard ?
could anything have been done differently - at a government departmental level perhaps - to improve things ?
km : the flat cash in the research councils is something that is affecting all the research councils .
the reason is that the new money - and there is lots of new money going into research - is going to make the research sustainable through full economic costing .
it particularly hits the stfc , perhaps , more than some other research councils , because our programmes are long-term .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
other research councils can get by through just awarding fewer grants - by starting fewer new activities , because they tend to fund things on a short timescale .
at stfc , our programmes are long-term - lasting 15 or 20 years in some cases .
and the only way to cope with the erosive effect of inflation which reduces the amount we can do is to stop things - and that 's painful .
it 's natural that people who are working on facilities that need to be discontinued get upset - i would if i was them .
so some of the reaction is , perhaps , understandable .
but we are where we have a finite budget .
we have to use it in the most effective way and we ca n't fund everything .
we have many more new ideas than we can possibly ever fund .
pr : there have been recent reports in the media that jodrell bank in cheshire could be threatened by cuts to its programmes .

the new synchrotron radiation source -lrb- diamond -rrb- has been built at harwell -lrb- oxfordshire -rrb- , which was a decision made many years ago .
but it is only now we are getting to the point where srs actually closes and clearly that causes some problems - some distress .
we 're having to make some people redundant as a result .
but the future of daresbury is something we 're working very hard to secure .
our vision for daresbury is a science base which is much broader than one based just on synchrotron sources .
that 's what we 're working towards and we 'll be making announcements in the next few months to put meat on those bones .
but i 'm clear in my mind that daresbury is already a very successful site .
we were there with -lrb- science minister -rrb- ian pearson -lrb- on 3 april -rrb- , opening a new innovation centre and the buzz around it was just incredible - very , very positive .
daresbury is going places , scientifically as well as on the innovation front .
it will be one of our flagships .
we 're pushing it as hard as we can .
it will be a fantastic place to be .
pr : lastly , what 's your prognosis for uk particle physics and astronomy over coming years ?
km : with the advent of full economic costing , there 's actually a lot more money going into uk physics and astronomy - into the university system - than there was a few years ago .
and it is creating a sustainable base which will stand us in good stead for the future .
it 's very important and i 'm going to keep pushing it .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
we have new facilities coming online yearly .
we have alma -lrb- the atacama large millimetre array -rrb- coming online .
i just got a message from our people in hawaii a couple of days ago that the scuba 2 camera is now being put into the jcmt -lrb- james clerk maxwell telescope -rrb- dome .
this is a world-leading technology that will keep the uk at the forefront of sub-millimetre astronomy .
it 's incredibly exciting .
there are lots and lots of things to look forward to and i 'm incredibly enthusiastic about it .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with sheffield university 's prof paul crowther .
having close links with daresbury lab in cheshire i am personally seeing the impact this is having on the morale of the staff and scientists .
this facility is fantastic and if you had attended any of the open days which they hold for the staff , their families and the local schools you would really see what motivates children to go and study science .
removing this kind of hands on access to science will damage our science capability for generations to come .
the cuts are very shortsighted .
science is an essential part to every day life without it how would you drive to work in a morning , heat the water to make a brew or find cures for cancer .
lisa j cordwell , irlam the stfc chief exec is quoted here as asserting " we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini . "
compare this to the stfc press release of 15th november : " the stfc informed the board that the stfc , in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond , is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory . "
is it any wonder there was " a bit of a misunderstanding " ?
paul crowther 's www page includes a good summary of contradictory statements from stfc on this issue .
russell smith , durham there is more than a little irony in keith mason laying the blame for astronomy 's current funding problems on the introduction of full economic costing -lrb- fec -rrb- as a mechanism to make research properly sustainable .
the grant that supports astronomy research here in nottingham was scheduled for renewal last year .
we duly put in our bid for support , including the level of fec that had been calculated as appropriate for sustaining research -lrb- using an official audited process called the trac protocol -rrb- .
the grant was highly rated by the review panel , and recommended for funding , including the level of fec that we had requested .
there was then a lengthy delay as the full extent of the funding problems in stfc became apparent .
finally , the grant was announced , but in order to try and meet some of its budget shortfall , the recommended level of fec had been slashed by more than a factor of two .
consultation with other universities that had grants in for renewal this round indicates ! that they suffered comparable arbitrary cuts in the level of fec awarded .
if our experience is anything to go by , stfc is not spending its new money on anything like the level of fec required to sustain a research programme .
michael merrifield , professor of astronomy , university of nottingham , nottingham i found keith mason 's response to the question about students wondering if it was worth staying in astronomy to be quite insulting .
i am approaching the end of a four year masters degree in physics and astrophysics and have been planning to do a phd in some are of space research .
the reason i , like other students , am worried by the cuts is not that i feel i wo n't make money but that the cuts will make it harder for me to find a job at all !
it is the nature of the economy the stfc claims to be supporting that you need to make money to survive .
i know that a research career in astronomy will never make me a millionaire .
if i wanted to make money then i would work in the city where physics degrees are in high demand .
my reasons for wanting to get into astronomy research are my curiosity and desire for knowledge , not wealth .
however i ca n't do this for nothing .
perhaps we should ask how much prof mason earns for leading stfc .
surely serving your country should n't be about the money ?
tim coveney , hull uk the really stupid aspect of the decisions was that previous funding of millions of pounds had gone into developing capital facilities like emerlin only for them to be stopped. emerlin is due to come on stream this year but for a cost of 1/3 an england football manager we will lose any benefit from the millions spent over the last few years - this is called sensible planning !
ros , renfrewshire as a physicist -lrb- and " part time " astrophyz -rrb- i feel very disappointed by the sudden cuts in funding .
i fear that the lack of funding could be a major set back and that the position of the uk will suffer eventually .
space technology has been providing jobs for many , and advances in science and technology do not come only from the bio / chemistry part .
may i add that i have nothing against biologists or chemists .
nuclear power is bound to take more importance if we want clean energy .
how can we do it if research , and training at the grassroots levels are impeded ?
when i learnt of the closing of reading university 's physics department , i felt betrayed .
the other critical problem for the lack of funding will be the lack of jobs for fresh graduates and postgrads leading highly skilled worker seeking jobs abroad .
very bad for uk 's economy .
kim vignitchouk , guildford britain is one of the richest countries in the world and our science research is world class .
i 'm disgusted that the government can not be bothered to provide the funding required .
this research could benefit the whole of mankind and i find it incredible that it is treated with such disrespect by the government .
albert leach , southampton , hampshire , uk has anyone noticed ?
it 's the countries that invest heavily in science and technology education and research that are the wealthiest and happiest ?
what does uk do ?
close university chemistry departments and fund art galleries and theatre groups .
michael papworth , evesham i was funded by pparc -lrb- the predecessor of stfc -rrb- to study my astrophysics phd and i am appalled by the continuing stories of cuts and projects under threat .
fundamental physics research is so important to the uk - not just economically but also culturally .
this £ 80 million shortfall represents less than 0.1 % of either the nhs or social welfare budget !
why ca n't the government just write stfc a cheque ?
james steel , clitheroe , uk i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .
in parallel we have crisis-management by stfc members , talk of " taxpayers ' money " and that " taxpayers have a right to a return . "
what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london i 'm a science teacher .
the government has provided incentives for certain science undergraduates to specialise as science teachers because of a predicted shortage , and all that implies for the uk 's future .

what constitutes this future " return " is not clear , nor even how they predict it , but it 's news and there is no disguising this fatuous situation from my students : not one of them wants to be a scientist , or a science teacher .
david marshall , london reading the above article it seems to me that what we do n't want is investment into research being dictated by media interest lobbying and vested interest .
the job of deciding the level of resources in the various area 's will always be contentious however , i would think that it would be important to make the decisions transparent and for changes to take place over a three to five year time frame to enable the changes in the number of research graduates needed in each area to be planned for .
there is only one thing that you can guarantee and that is the decisions will be wrong at least 30 % of the time .
i personally think to much of our research funding is being spent on particle and astro physics .
t carlin , suffolk just to make it clear the funding body have been given an 11 % rise in latest 3 yr budget by government .
mark , sheffield uk the point is ' was the government made fully aware of the impact of introducing fec during the spending review ? ' .
also short-term funding problems become long-term problems as expertise lost is not easily regained .
g burt , glasgow do we / industry make any money out of the projects , if the answer is no then it must get the chop are other eu partners doing the same or similar research if the answer is yes it must be the chop alan , morpeth in this interview professor mason comes across as being the mealy-mouthed puppet of a weasel government that is cutting science budgets , hiding behind terms like " full economic costing " , " flagships " and " visions " .
is this man a champion of the uk science or a champion of his government masters ?
alastair donald , abingdon , uk from now to the end uk will depend of usa crumbs .
gustavo mendoza , lima , peru we can waste billions of pounds on iraq and the olympics but ca n't find what is a relatively small amount of money to support our technological future .
it 's time our government woke up .
w bates , poynton , uk £ 1bn was found for the millennium dome , £ 9.3bn for the olympics , £ 100bn to bail out northern rock .
and yet £ 80m , spread over 3 years , ca n't be found to cover a science budget shortfall .
where are the government 's priorities ?
if they were truly committed to science , this money would be made available immediately ! ! !

the stfc has been embroiled in a storm of criticism over cuts to its science portfolio .
bbc news science reporter paul rincon interviewed professor mason in belfast , where he was preparing to address astronomers gathered for their annual meeting .
paul rincon : have you been surprised by the strength and organisation of the opposition to cuts proposed by the stfc ?
professor keith mason : well , i think one has to first of all recognise why we 're having to make economies in certain areas of our programmes .
that 's because there is a restructuring of the way science is funded in the uk .
there is more money going into science ; but we had a situation up until very recently where the university research base in particular was not sustainable .
what you said about this issue the fabric of university buildings , for example , was deteriorating and nobody was paying for them .
we are changing that .
we 're going to an era of full economic costing .
we 're putting a lot more money into universities for the research they 're doing .
this unfortunately means that is taking up the new money in the short term ; but it will be worth it in the end .
these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront so we 're in a situation where , after the full economic costing revolution - and it is a real revolution - that the university research base will be sustainable .
we will be able to maintain the cutting edge .
and then we 'll be able to start growing our programme again .
but the situation we 're in now is that we are having to make some economies .
and let 's not overstate the size of the economies - it 's £ 30m a year on a £ 400m programme .
we have to make some economies in the short term in order to put the research on a sustainable basis in the long-term .

advertisement watch susan watts ' film on the issue from bbc newsnight pr : there has been come criticism that in trying to fund some of the more applied science programmes with , perhaps , more potential economic benefit , you are cutting basic research which feeds into and supports those applied areas .
is any of that criticism justified ?
km : i think there is a fundamental misunderstanding there .
we 're not cutting pure research in order to do applied research .
everything we do has a very high " blue skies " content - it 's in the nature of what we do .
this is not the issue at all .
quite the contrary .
the issue is simply to put the research base on a sustainable basis .
our line is we need to do more research , more pure research , more fundamental research , because that 's where the real advances come and then they feed into the economy on timescales that can be quite short , but is often very long .
and we need to recognise that there 's that spectrum of response as well .
the uk has now been reinstated as a full member of gemini but what we need to do differently is , first of all , we must not stop scientists from doing pure research .
we do not want to turn scientists into salesmen .
quite the contrary .
we want to leave scientists doing what they do best , which is the research .
but we must put in mechanisms to capture that research and capture the ideas - and there are many of those that we are not using - to capture those much more effectively , so that we can benefit the economy .
and if we can benefit the economy , we can afford to invest more in research , so everybody wins .
pr : i wanted to ask about the gemini telescopes .
some observers have seen that as a bit of a flip-flop by stfc , where you were in and then you were out .
what is the current status there ?
km : again , we have had a consistent line here .
there has been some misunderstanding over gemini .
we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini .
the issue with gemini is the re-equipment of the instrument base for gemini .
we are currently in gemini until 2012 , but the new instruments do n't come online until 2014 , 2015 .
so we needed to have a debate about whether we should pay for those instruments because if we 're not going to stay in gemini beyond 2012 then clearly it 's not sensible to be paying for instrumentation that you do n't use .
but i think this did lead to a bit of a misunderstanding with our international partners .
that is all very unfortunate .
but it 's all water under the bridge now , we 've sorted that one out .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here these things do happen occasionally , and they 're not at all unusual .
but our line has been consistent .
we do need to understand how we 're going to take our partnership with gemini into the future , or whether there are other things we need to invest in in terms of , for example , building extremely large telescopes through the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- route .
we have to define a strategy over the next year or so .
and that will be a forward-looking strategy which needs to be affordable .
of course , there is no point in having a strategy that 's not affordable .
but we will be doing that and we will be talking to people about what the requirements are : when do we need a 30m telescope ? and do we need it sooner rather than later ?
and if we need it sooner rather than later then we have to stop doing something else in order to accelerate the development of that .
but these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront .
pr : it must be unprecedented that the royal astronomical society -lsb- council -rsb- expressed a lack of confidence in stfc 's handling of the situation .
what are you doing to reassure the scientific community and respond to their criticisms of stfc decisions ?
km : well i think the origin of some of the criticisms is the fact that we are a new research council .
we have a much wider remit than the predecessors to stfc and the astronomy and particle physics communities have been used to having - over the last 13 years - with their own research council in pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- .
now that activity is embedded in a larger entity .
press coverage about jodrell bank was " misinformed " said prof mason i believe people were naturally suspicious of the motivation for the merger -lrb- pparc with cclrc , council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- - whether that meant there was going to be a downplaying of astronomy and particle physics .
as a result of that , they 've been very focused on every action we 've taken .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here .
particle physics and astronomy is incredibly important .
we believe it is important .
we will continue to push for that area of science , alongside our other wider responsibilities .
i think one of the big advantages of the new research council with its broader base is that we can exploit the synergies between research areas more effectively .
interdisciplinary research - that 's where the big gains are .
we 've got to get people out of their silos and thinking in broader terms .
for example , the same technology we need to build a very large telescope is the same type of optics we need to possibly build a workable nuclear fusion generator that might address the world 's energy needs .
that kind of technology cross-talk between various areas is incredibly important .
we need to take advantage of that and that 's what we 're seeking to do .
pr : why has the " flat cash settlement " hit stfc so hard ?
could anything have been done differently - at a government departmental level perhaps - to improve things ?
km : the flat cash in the research councils is something that is affecting all the research councils .
the reason is that the new money - and there is lots of new money going into research - is going to make the research sustainable through full economic costing .
it particularly hits the stfc , perhaps , more than some other research councils , because our programmes are long-term .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
other research councils can get by through just awarding fewer grants - by starting fewer new activities , because they tend to fund things on a short timescale .
at stfc , our programmes are long-term - lasting 15 or 20 years in some cases .
and the only way to cope with the erosive effect of inflation which reduces the amount we can do is to stop things - and that 's painful .
it 's natural that people who are working on facilities that need to be discontinued get upset - i would if i was them .
so some of the reaction is , perhaps , understandable .
but we are where we have a finite budget .
we have to use it in the most effective way and we ca n't fund everything .
we have many more new ideas than we can possibly ever fund .
pr : there have been recent reports in the media that jodrell bank in cheshire could be threatened by cuts to its programmes .
can you reassure people that it will stay open ?
km : firstly , whether jodrell bank stays open is a matter for manchester university not us , because we do n't own it .
the issue that has been discussed in the press , particularly , revolves around funding of emerlin .
we had some advice from an independent group of scientists which rated emerlin as being in the lower priority category .
but when we released that prioritisation , we put a rider on it saying that the stfc council recognised that there were wider strategic issues involved here .
and this is the case .
one of the other things in our prioritisation is the square kilometre array -lrb- ska -rrb- , which is the future of radio astronomy .
that is also run out of jodrell bank and is of the very highest priority for us .
it 's something where the uk can be the world leader .
some astronomers think their field is not being rewarded properly we are already leading that project out of jodrell bank in a european context .
we can take a world lead in that , provided we invest in it soon .
and the issue with emerlin is really the fact that that programme is running several years late and it means that if we continue to support that at the current level , we might not be able to start our activities in the square kilometre array at an opportune time to retain the lead .
now , that does n't mean we 're not going to fund emerlin or fund square kilometre array .
but we have to think these things through .
we have to talk to the university of manchester about how we get to where we need to be with both of these projects .
and as i said on a previous occasion , the furore in the press about jodrell bank has been very misinformed in many ways .
reports of jodrell bank 's demise are overly exaggerated , certainly .
that 's not in our mind at all .
we always have to make hard choices .
we have a long-term goal , which is the square kilometre array , and we need to understand how to get there. emerlin is part of the pathway for getting there .
but the rate at which we invest in emerlin , the rate at which we can invest in the square kilometre array - those are things we have to determine very carefully and very sensitively if we are going to get to where we want to be .
pr : the head of the cockcroft institute -lrb- the uk 's new accelerator science centre -rrb- recently said daresbury laboratory , also in cheshire , could close if certain programmes there are cut .
what would you say to people about the future of those two sites ?
km : daresbury is one of our flagship science and innovation campuses .
and the key thing is : science and innovation .
they are both important .
daresbury has been going through a low recently because of the closure of the synchrotron radiation source -lrb- srs -rrb- .
the new synchrotron radiation source -lrb- diamond -rrb- has been built at harwell -lrb- oxfordshire -rrb- , which was a decision made many years ago .
but it is only now we are getting to the point where srs actually closes and clearly that causes some problems - some distress .
we 're having to make some people redundant as a result .
but the future of daresbury is something we 're working very hard to secure .
our vision for daresbury is a science base which is much broader than one based just on synchrotron sources .
that 's what we 're working towards and we 'll be making announcements in the next few months to put meat on those bones .
but i 'm clear in my mind that daresbury is already a very successful site .
we were there with -lrb- science minister -rrb- ian pearson -lrb- on 3 april -rrb- , opening a new innovation centre and the buzz around it was just incredible - very , very positive .
daresbury is going places , scientifically as well as on the innovation front .
it will be one of our flagships .
we 're pushing it as hard as we can .
it will be a fantastic place to be .
pr : lastly , what 's your prognosis for uk particle physics and astronomy over coming years ?
km : with the advent of full economic costing , there 's actually a lot more money going into uk physics and astronomy - into the university system - than there was a few years ago .
and it is creating a sustainable base which will stand us in good stead for the future .
it 's very important and i 'm going to keep pushing it .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
we have new facilities coming online yearly .
we have alma -lrb- the atacama large millimetre array -rrb- coming online .
i just got a message from our people in hawaii a couple of days ago that the scuba 2 camera is now being put into the jcmt -lrb- james clerk maxwell telescope -rrb- dome .
this is a world-leading technology that will keep the uk at the forefront of sub-millimetre astronomy .
it 's incredibly exciting .
there are lots and lots of things to look forward to and i 'm incredibly enthusiastic about it .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with sheffield university 's prof paul crowther .

the stfc has been embroiled in a storm of criticism over cuts to its science portfolio .
bbc news science reporter paul rincon interviewed professor mason in belfast , where he was preparing to address astronomers gathered for their annual meeting .
paul rincon : have you been surprised by the strength and organisation of the opposition to cuts proposed by the stfc ?
professor keith mason : well , i think one has to first of all recognise why we 're having to make economies in certain areas of our programmes .
that 's because there is a restructuring of the way science is funded in the uk .
there is more money going into science ; but we had a situation up until very recently where the university research base in particular was not sustainable .
what you said about this issue the fabric of university buildings , for example , was deteriorating and nobody was paying for them .
we are changing that .
we 're going to an era of full economic costing .
we 're putting a lot more money into universities for the research they 're doing .
this unfortunately means that is taking up the new money in the short term ; but it will be worth it in the end .
these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront so we 're in a situation where , after the full economic costing revolution - and it is a real revolution - that the university research base will be sustainable .
we will be able to maintain the cutting edge .
and then we 'll be able to start growing our programme again .
but the situation we 're in now is that we are having to make some economies .
and let 's not overstate the size of the economies - it 's £ 30m a year on a £ 400m programme .
we have to make some economies in the short term in order to put the research on a sustainable basis in the long-term .
please turn on javascript .

advertisement watch susan watts ' film on the issue from bbc newsnight pr : there has been come criticism that in trying to fund some of the more applied science programmes with , perhaps , more potential economic benefit , you are cutting basic research which feeds into and supports those applied areas .
is any of that criticism justified ?
km : i think there is a fundamental misunderstanding there .
we 're not cutting pure research in order to do applied research .
everything we do has a very high " blue skies " content - it 's in the nature of what we do .
this is not the issue at all .
quite the contrary .
the issue is simply to put the research base on a sustainable basis .
our line is we need to do more research , more pure research , more fundamental research , because that 's where the real advances come and then they feed into the economy on timescales that can be quite short , but is often very long .
and we need to recognise that there 's that spectrum of response as well .
the uk has now been reinstated as a full member of gemini but what we need to do differently is , first of all , we must not stop scientists from doing pure research .
we do not want to turn scientists into salesmen .
quite the contrary .
we want to leave scientists doing what they do best , which is the research .
but we must put in mechanisms to capture that research and capture the ideas - and there are many of those that we are not using - to capture those much more effectively , so that we can benefit the economy .
and if we can benefit the economy , we can afford to invest more in research , so everybody wins .
pr : i wanted to ask about the gemini telescopes .
some observers have seen that as a bit of a flip-flop by stfc , where you were in and then you were out .
what is the current status there ?
km : again , we have had a consistent line here .
there has been some misunderstanding over gemini .
we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini .
the issue with gemini is the re-equipment of the instrument base for gemini .
we are currently in gemini until 2012 , but the new instruments do n't come online until 2014 , 2015 .
so we needed to have a debate about whether we should pay for those instruments because if we 're not going to stay in gemini beyond 2012 then clearly it 's not sensible to be paying for instrumentation that you do n't use .
but i think this did lead to a bit of a misunderstanding with our international partners .
that is all very unfortunate .
but it 's all water under the bridge now , we 've sorted that one out .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here these things do happen occasionally , and they 're not at all unusual .
but our line has been consistent .
we do need to understand how we 're going to take our partnership with gemini into the future , or whether there are other things we need to invest in in terms of , for example , building extremely large telescopes through the european southern observatory -lrb- eso -rrb- route .
we have to define a strategy over the next year or so .
and that will be a forward-looking strategy which needs to be affordable .
of course , there is no point in having a strategy that 's not affordable .
but we will be doing that and we will be talking to people about what the requirements are : when do we need a 30m telescope ? and do we need it sooner rather than later ?
and if we need it sooner rather than later then we have to stop doing something else in order to accelerate the development of that .
but these are hard decisions , and decisions that we are determined to face up to , because that 's what our job is - to keep the uk at the forefront .
pr : it must be unprecedented that the royal astronomical society -lsb- council -rsb- expressed a lack of confidence in stfc 's handling of the situation .
what are you doing to reassure the scientific community and respond to their criticisms of stfc decisions ?
km : well i think the origin of some of the criticisms is the fact that we are a new research council .
we have a much wider remit than the predecessors to stfc and the astronomy and particle physics communities have been used to having - over the last 13 years - with their own research council in pparc -lrb- the particle physics and astronomy research council -rrb- .
now that activity is embedded in a larger entity .
press coverage about jodrell bank was " misinformed " said prof mason i believe people were naturally suspicious of the motivation for the merger -lrb- pparc with cclrc , council for the central laboratory of the research councils -rrb- - whether that meant there was going to be a downplaying of astronomy and particle physics .
as a result of that , they 've been very focused on every action we 've taken .
what i can tell people is that there is no hidden agenda here .
particle physics and astronomy is incredibly important .
we believe it is important .
we will continue to push for that area of science , alongside our other wider responsibilities .
i think one of the big advantages of the new research council with its broader base is that we can exploit the synergies between research areas more effectively .
interdisciplinary research - that 's where the big gains are .
we 've got to get people out of their silos and thinking in broader terms .
for example , the same technology we need to build a very large telescope is the same type of optics we need to possibly build a workable nuclear fusion generator that might address the world 's energy needs .
that kind of technology cross-talk between various areas is incredibly important .
we need to take advantage of that and that 's what we 're seeking to do .
pr : why has the " flat cash settlement " hit stfc so hard ?
could anything have been done differently - at a government departmental level perhaps - to improve things ?
km : the flat cash in the research councils is something that is affecting all the research councils .
the reason is that the new money - and there is lots of new money going into research - is going to make the research sustainable through full economic costing .
it particularly hits the stfc , perhaps , more than some other research councils , because our programmes are long-term .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
other research councils can get by through just awarding fewer grants - by starting fewer new activities , because they tend to fund things on a short timescale .
at stfc , our programmes are long-term - lasting 15 or 20 years in some cases .
and the only way to cope with the erosive effect of inflation which reduces the amount we can do is to stop things - and that 's painful .
it 's natural that people who are working on facilities that need to be discontinued get upset - i would if i was them .
so some of the reaction is , perhaps , understandable .
but we are where we have a finite budget .
we have to use it in the most effective way and we ca n't fund everything .
we have many more new ideas than we can possibly ever fund .
pr : there have been recent reports in the media that jodrell bank in cheshire could be threatened by cuts to its programmes .
can you reassure people that it will stay open ?
km : firstly , whether jodrell bank stays open is a matter for manchester university not us , because we do n't own it .
the issue that has been discussed in the press , particularly , revolves around funding of emerlin .
we had some advice from an independent group of scientists which rated emerlin as being in the lower priority category .
but when we released that prioritisation , we put a rider on it saying that the stfc council recognised that there were wider strategic issues involved here .
and this is the case .
one of the other things in our prioritisation is the square kilometre array -lrb- ska -rrb- , which is the future of radio astronomy .
that is also run out of jodrell bank and is of the very highest priority for us .
it 's something where the uk can be the world leader .
some astronomers think their field is not being rewarded properly we are already leading that project out of jodrell bank in a european context .
we can take a world lead in that , provided we invest in it soon .
and the issue with emerlin is really the fact that that programme is running several years late and it means that if we continue to support that at the current level , we might not be able to start our activities in the square kilometre array at an opportune time to retain the lead .
now , that does n't mean we 're not going to fund emerlin or fund square kilometre array .
but we have to think these things through .
we have to talk to the university of manchester about how we get to where we need to be with both of these projects .
and as i said on a previous occasion , the furore in the press about jodrell bank has been very misinformed in many ways .
reports of jodrell bank 's demise are overly exaggerated , certainly .
that 's not in our mind at all .
we always have to make hard choices .
we have a long-term goal , which is the square kilometre array , and we need to understand how to get there. emerlin is part of the pathway for getting there .
but the rate at which we invest in emerlin , the rate at which we can invest in the square kilometre array - those are things we have to determine very carefully and very sensitively if we are going to get to where we want to be .
pr : the head of the cockcroft institute -lrb- the uk 's new accelerator science centre -rrb- recently said daresbury laboratory , also in cheshire , could close if certain programmes there are cut .
what would you say to people about the future of those two sites ?
km : daresbury is one of our flagship science and innovation campuses .
and the key thing is : science and innovation .
they are both important .
daresbury has been going through a low recently because of the closure of the synchrotron radiation source -lrb- srs -rrb- .
the new synchrotron radiation source -lrb- diamond -rrb- has been built at harwell -lrb- oxfordshire -rrb- , which was a decision made many years ago .
but it is only now we are getting to the point where srs actually closes and clearly that causes some problems - some distress .
we 're having to make some people redundant as a result .
but the future of daresbury is something we 're working very hard to secure .
our vision for daresbury is a science base which is much broader than one based just on synchrotron sources .
that 's what we 're working towards and we 'll be making announcements in the next few months to put meat on those bones .
but i 'm clear in my mind that daresbury is already a very successful site .
we were there with -lrb- science minister -rrb- ian pearson -lrb- on 3 april -rrb- , opening a new innovation centre and the buzz around it was just incredible - very , very positive .
daresbury is going places , scientifically as well as on the innovation front .
it will be one of our flagships .
we 're pushing it as hard as we can .
it will be a fantastic place to be .
pr : lastly , what 's your prognosis for uk particle physics and astronomy over coming years ?
km : with the advent of full economic costing , there 's actually a lot more money going into uk physics and astronomy - into the university system - than there was a few years ago .
and it is creating a sustainable base which will stand us in good stead for the future .
it 's very important and i 'm going to keep pushing it .
we will get through these short-term difficulties - we have a very healthy programme .
we have new facilities coming online yearly .
we have alma -lrb- the atacama large millimetre array -rrb- coming online .
i just got a message from our people in hawaii a couple of days ago that the scuba 2 camera is now being put into the jcmt -lrb- james clerk maxwell telescope -rrb- dome .
this is a world-leading technology that will keep the uk at the forefront of sub-millimetre astronomy .
it 's incredibly exciting .
there are lots and lots of things to look forward to and i 'm incredibly enthusiastic about it .
we solicited your comments on the financial woes currently facing uk physics and astronomy .
the comments below relate to this page and the parallel interview with sheffield university 's prof paul crowther .
having close links with daresbury lab in cheshire i am personally seeing the impact this is having on the morale of the staff and scientists .
this facility is fantastic and if you had attended any of the open days which they hold for the staff , their families and the local schools you would really see what motivates children to go and study science .
removing this kind of hands on access to science will damage our science capability for generations to come .
the cuts are very shortsighted .
science is an essential part to every day life without it how would you drive to work in a morning , heat the water to make a brew or find cures for cancer .
lisa j cordwell , irlam the stfc chief exec is quoted here as asserting " we have never withdrawn , or indicated that we would withdraw from gemini . "
compare this to the stfc press release of 15th november : " the stfc informed the board that the stfc , in shaping its programme for the next 3 years and beyond , is planning to withdraw from the gemini observatory . "
is it any wonder there was " a bit of a misunderstanding " ?
paul crowther 's www page includes a good summary of contradictory statements from stfc on this issue .
russell smith , durham there is more than a little irony in keith mason laying the blame for astronomy 's current funding problems on the introduction of full economic costing -lrb- fec -rrb- as a mechanism to make research properly sustainable .
the grant that supports astronomy research here in nottingham was scheduled for renewal last year .
we duly put in our bid for support , including the level of fec that had been calculated as appropriate for sustaining research -lrb- using an official audited process called the trac protocol -rrb- .
the grant was highly rated by the review panel , and recommended for funding , including the level of fec that we had requested .
there was then a lengthy delay as the full extent of the funding problems in stfc became apparent .
finally , the grant was announced , but in order to try and meet some of its budget shortfall , the recommended level of fec had been slashed by more than a factor of two .
consultation with other universities that had grants in for renewal this round indicates ! that they suffered comparable arbitrary cuts in the level of fec awarded .
if our experience is anything to go by , stfc is not spending its new money on anything like the level of fec required to sustain a research programme .
michael merrifield , professor of astronomy , university of nottingham , nottingham i found keith mason 's response to the question about students wondering if it was worth staying in astronomy to be quite insulting .
i am approaching the end of a four year masters degree in physics and astrophysics and have been planning to do a phd in some are of space research .
the reason i , like other students , am worried by the cuts is not that i feel i wo n't make money but that the cuts will make it harder for me to find a job at all !
it is the nature of the economy the stfc claims to be supporting that you need to make money to survive .
i know that a research career in astronomy will never make me a millionaire .
if i wanted to make money then i would work in the city where physics degrees are in high demand .
my reasons for wanting to get into astronomy research are my curiosity and desire for knowledge , not wealth .
however i ca n't do this for nothing .
perhaps we should ask how much prof mason earns for leading stfc .
surely serving your country should n't be about the money ?
tim coveney , hull uk the really stupid aspect of the decisions was that previous funding of millions of pounds had gone into developing capital facilities like emerlin only for them to be stopped. emerlin is due to come on stream this year but for a cost of 1/3 an england football manager we will lose any benefit from the millions spent over the last few years - this is called sensible planning !
ros , renfrewshire as a physicist -lrb- and " part time " astrophyz -rrb- i feel very disappointed by the sudden cuts in funding .
i fear that the lack of funding could be a major set back and that the position of the uk will suffer eventually .
space technology has been providing jobs for many , and advances in science and technology do not come only from the bio / chemistry part .
may i add that i have nothing against biologists or chemists .
nuclear power is bound to take more importance if we want clean energy .
how can we do it if research , and training at the grassroots levels are impeded ?
when i learnt of the closing of reading university 's physics department , i felt betrayed .
the other critical problem for the lack of funding will be the lack of jobs for fresh graduates and postgrads leading highly skilled worker seeking jobs abroad .
very bad for uk 's economy .

the newham councillor says political correctness has not left people " space to have a conscience " , something which has helped turn society " superficial , materialistic and selfish " .
" everything is about shopping and celebrities .
the vulnerable just get swept aside , " said mr craig , 62 , leader of the christian people 's alliance and the christian choice candidate for london mayor .
he points to community projects , such as an ilford-based drugs rehabilitation which he says lost money because their christian ethos did not fit government funding guidelines .

lives ' wasted ' mr craig , father to two daughters and two stepsons , is a strong believer in christian values and the family 's place at the heart of society , and of government .
becoming a christian in his late 20s , he turned his back on a successful career in business and a " posh flat " in highgate to move to canning town - one of london 's most deprived areas - in the east end .
there his belief that the breakdown of the family was at the root of much of society 's ill was strengthened during his work with young offenders in the 1980s .

he said it had become " an established track " for youngsters in care to do some time in prison - " to them it was normal " .
' the m word ' while he says he understands the arguments about needing more policemen on the streets and more youth clubs and other facilities - he argues a deeper shift in values is needed to properly tackle youth crime .
" some of these kids are ' unclubbable ' they enjoy being on the street , " he said .
" i know there 's no easy solution to it ... it 's very very difficult to get them off that track . "
he added : " the mayor , in his or her role as a political leader , has to start shifting things back in favour of marriage and the family . "
mr craig says street pastors have been a success the conservatives have complained about the " tax bias " against marriage - but mr craig says he was discussing the issue nine years ago when the " m word " was not mentioned in parliament because " they will accuse you of being against single mums " .
he says it is " perfectly valid " to try to help single parents , but by doing so " we have actually financially disadvantaged marriage " .

last november biendi litambola , 17 , died after an assault on the street .
in 2005 it was among areas blacklisted by courier firm dhl because its drivers complained of thuggish behaviour by gangs of youths .
ministers ' claims that there is no " epidemic " of gun and knife crime are greeted with " a hollow laugh " in this part of london , says mr craig .
he would like to see more use made of voluntary sector faith groups - such as street pastors in kingston and peckham who talk to youngsters out on a friday and saturday night who he says are making a " real difference " , as they are non-confrontational .

his predecessor as cpa mayoral candidate ram gidoomal managed to get more than 40,000 first preference votes at each of the 2000 and 2004 elections .
mr craig has made a name for himself as a leading opponent of plans to build a 12,000 capacity mosque in the heart of the east end - a battle that provoked one person to make an " obituary " video to him and his family and put it on youtube .
christianity is in the soul of the country alan craig his main argument is against the group who wish to build the mosque - tablighi jamaat - who he says preach separatism and will upset the ethnically diverse community .

tablighi jamaat say claims it will be a " mega mosque " are an exaggeration - as the plans will also include a school , conference centre and garden which will be open to everyone .
the mosque will be one of his main campaigning issues - and he says it is not just christians who are against it , he has the support of many muslims too .
he claims some support from other faiths in previous local elections - and says there are many londoners who might not go to church regularly , but consider themselves christians .
he points out an example of a local primary school which chose to celebrate a " festival of lights " on 14 december 2005 - rather than holding a christmas carol service .

the newham councillor says political correctness has not left people " space to have a conscience " , something which has helped turn society " superficial , materialistic and selfish " .
" everything is about shopping and celebrities .
the vulnerable just get swept aside , " said mr craig , 62 , leader of the christian people 's alliance and the christian choice candidate for london mayor .
he points to community projects , such as an ilford-based drugs rehabilitation which he says lost money because their christian ethos did not fit government funding guidelines .
" that sort of thing is complete nonsense , " he said .
" it is precisely that secular agenda that 's actually wrecking so much of society and that 's why i set up the party . "
lives ' wasted ' mr craig , father to two daughters and two stepsons , is a strong believer in christian values and the family 's place at the heart of society , and of government .
becoming a christian in his late 20s , he turned his back on a successful career in business and a " posh flat " in highgate to move to canning town - one of london 's most deprived areas - in the east end .
there his belief that the breakdown of the family was at the root of much of society 's ill was strengthened during his work with young offenders in the 1980s .
he set up a hostel to house young men coming out of prison , who wanted to go straight - but with no support network were at risk of falling back in with their old associates .
top pledges back families and marriage end culture of youth violence more affordable homes reject ' olympics mega mosque ' tackle inequality with more jobs " i saw young men whose lives were being wasted in prison and i thought something could be done about it .
i wanted to have a go , " he said .
" the vast majority of them came from ' broken homes ' - which is a concept which we do n't use so much now - a significant number of them came from care homes . "
he said it had become " an established track " for youngsters in care to do some time in prison - " to them it was normal " .
' the m word ' while he says he understands the arguments about needing more policemen on the streets and more youth clubs and other facilities - he argues a deeper shift in values is needed to properly tackle youth crime .
" some of these kids are ' unclubbable ' they enjoy being on the street , " he said .
" i know there 's no easy solution to it ... it 's very very difficult to get them off that track . "
he added : " the mayor , in his or her role as a political leader , has to start shifting things back in favour of marriage and the family . "
the conservatives have complained about the " tax bias " against marriage - but mr craig says he was discussing the issue nine years ago when the " m word " was not mentioned in parliament because " they will accuse you of being against single mums " .
he says it is " perfectly valid " to try to help single parents , but by doing so " we have actually financially disadvantaged marriage " .
" at the end of the day , marriage should be about love .
but actually if you are setting up a situation where you are encouraged to split , it is n't even a level playing field .
" society is saying marriage is not a good way of bringing up children , through its tax and benefit system . "
' hollow laugh ' crime is a big issue in canning town - where 22-year-old peter woodhams was shot dead outside his home by a teenager after months of harassment .
last november biendi litambola , 17 , died after an assault on the street .
in 2005 it was among areas blacklisted by courier firm dhl because its drivers complained of thuggish behaviour by gangs of youths .
ministers ' claims that there is no " epidemic " of gun and knife crime are greeted with " a hollow laugh " in this part of london , says mr craig .
he would like to see more use made of voluntary sector faith groups - such as street pastors in kingston and peckham who talk to youngsters out on a friday and saturday night who he says are making a " real difference " , as they are non-confrontational . "

visitor numbers rose 23 % in the first quarter of the year , the state-owned news agency sana reported , citing figures from the ministry of tourism .
syria has prioritised tourism development since 2002 , offering foreign firms tax incentives to invest .
a british travel firm said syria was increasingly appealing to europeans .
' historical bent ' " it has a very strong historical bent - more so than anywhere else - and a lot of gulf arab money has been channelled into the country , " said andrew hunt , who arranges upmarket holidays to the middle east and north africa for audley travel .
syria has become increasingly popular as a holiday destination in recent years with annual growth in visitor numbers of up to 15 % , double what it witnessed in the 1990s .
according to sana , visitor numbers rose 41 % to 99,000 last month , with 215,000 journeying to the country in the first quarter of the year .
we have been demand-led in bringing it -lrb- syria -rrb- back andrew hunt , audley travel while other arab countries account for nearly 75 % of foreign visitors , demand from europe , particularly italy , the netherlands and the uk , has picked up in recent times .
the tourist industry suffered serious setbacks in 2005 and 2006 when political unrest in syria and the israel-lebanon conflict forced several tour operators to drop out of the market .
" in the aftermath of the lebanon problem , we were obliged to pull syria as a destination , " audley 's mr hunt said .
" we have been demand-led in bringing it back . "
syria declared tourism a " pillar " of its national economy in 2002 and has since attracted billions in foreign investment through a series of tax breaks and financial incentives offered to hotel companies and developers .
ministers have attributed the growth in tourism investment to its improved transport infrastructure and its general " political and economic stability " .
mr hunt said that while syria offered unparalleled places of historical and cultural interest , it was likely to remain a " niche " destination compared with its neighbour jordan , because of the latter 's greater " diversity " .
