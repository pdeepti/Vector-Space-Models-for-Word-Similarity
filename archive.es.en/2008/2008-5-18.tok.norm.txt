the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .
if the pacific yew , a tree or shrub , vanishes , so does an active ingredient in cancer treatment .
the bark of the white willow contains a raw material of aspirin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel will open the conference some one-half of approved medicines in germany are based on plant material .
on a global scale , it is estimated that 40 percent of world trade involves biological processes and products .
whether food , medicines , nutrients or green energy , without biodiversity they are not possible .
experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .
we need an unprecedented effort to meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , " the executive secretary of the un biodiversity convention , ahmed djoghlaf , told reuters . he said consumption has reached unsustainable levels and without a change in behaviour , feeding nine billion people , the estimated world population in 2050 , would be difficult . deforestation - a huge factor in species loss and global carbon emissions contributing to climate change - is a central theme of this year 's conference in bonn , formerly the capital of west german . one in four mammal species , one in eight among birds , a third of amphibian creatures and 70 percent of all plant life made the most recent endangered list issued by another un agency , the world conservation union -lrb- wcu -rrb- . real economic losses experts say the loss of global biodiversity also has tangible effects on the world economy . ahead of the un meeting , germany 's der spiegel news magazine quoted from a report which said the destruction of flora and fauna is costing the world two trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 trillion -rrb- a year , or six percent of its overall gross national product . the european union and german environment ministry-led research , entitled " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " will be presented on monday at the un conference . in its edition out monday , der spiegel will present extracts from the paper , with the study 's lead author , pavan sukhdev , a senior figure with deutsche bank in india , writing that " the world 's poor bear the brunt of the cost . " agreements on conservation the meeting , which runs for two weeks , will see delegates talking about ways to boost and coordinate " protected areas " to conserve natural habitats .
the convention has set a goal to safeguard at least 10 percent of the world 's ecological regions in such areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strategies on forest conservation will also be discussed the conservation of oceans as well as forests will also be high on the agenda .
some 80 percent of the world 's biodiversity is found in forests in tropical regions , experts say , although every minute about 20 hectares -lrb- 50 acres -rrb- of forest disappear . the negotiations will reach a climax in the last three days when senior government officials from 191 countries , including german chancellor angela merkel , join the conference . " we 're at a crossroads with this convention : either we are able to come to concrete and practical results in bonn that revitalize the convention and see our first successes , " said gabriel .
" if we fail here , then the international community has to ask itself why it adopts these conventions in the first place . " delegates will also seek to make progress on so called " benefit sharing , " since developing countries want to be compensated by biotech and pharmaceutical companies eager to tap their natural resources . norway 's environment minister erik solheim told reuters the conference and its aims were something akin to the goal of world peace . " even if we do n't achieve it fully , it 's important to have a target to strive for , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .

the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .

if only serbia 's path to europe were that simple for those who want it . an anti-western government would mean a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing sunday 's election and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high .
for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest of western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . some unhappy with nationalist rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic does n't recognize kosovo independence , but wants serbia to pursue european ties already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .
as kahn himself once said , when asked if he had any pets , " the only animal i keep in my home is me . "

dw-world.de fans flock to bundesliga , occasionally get violent the season is n't even over , but germany 's soccer league has already set a new attendance record .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .
as kahn himself once said , when asked if he had any pets , " the only animal i keep in my home is me . "

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .
as kahn himself once said , when asked if he had any pets , " the only animal i keep in my home is me . "
but now kahn is retired , and the bundesliga wo n't feel the same without him .
maybe better , maybe worse , but in any case different . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .

beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .

on a global scale , it is estimated that 40 percent of world trade involves biological processes and products .
whether food , medicines , nutrients or green energy , without biodiversity they are not possible .
experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .

" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .
i regularly talk with religious leaders .
why not with the dalai lama ? "
wieczorek-zeul told spiegel online .

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .
if the pacific yew , a tree or shrub , vanishes , so does an active ingredient in cancer treatment .
the bark of the white willow contains a raw material of aspirin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel will open the conference some one-half of approved medicines in germany are based on plant material .
on a global scale , it is estimated that 40 percent of world trade involves biological processes and products .
whether food , medicines , nutrients or green energy , without biodiversity they are not possible .
experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .
we need an unprecedented effort to meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , " the executive secretary of the un biodiversity convention , ahmed djoghlaf , told reuters . he said consumption has reached unsustainable levels and without a change in behaviour , feeding nine billion people , the estimated world population in 2050 , would be difficult . deforestation - a huge factor in species loss and global carbon emissions contributing to climate change - is a central theme of this year 's conference in bonn , formerly the capital of west german . one in four mammal species , one in eight among birds , a third of amphibian creatures and 70 percent of all plant life made the most recent endangered list issued by another un agency , the world conservation union -lrb- wcu -rrb- . real economic losses experts say the loss of global biodiversity also has tangible effects on the world economy . ahead of the un meeting , germany 's der spiegel news magazine quoted from a report which said the destruction of flora and fauna is costing the world two trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 trillion -rrb- a year , or six percent of its overall gross national product . the european union and german environment ministry-led research , entitled " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " will be presented on monday at the un conference . in its edition out monday , der spiegel will present extracts from the paper , with the study 's lead author , pavan sukhdev , a senior figure with deutsche bank in india , writing that " the world 's poor bear the brunt of the cost . " agreements on conservation the meeting , which runs for two weeks , will see delegates talking about ways to boost and coordinate " protected areas " to conserve natural habitats .
the convention has set a goal to safeguard at least 10 percent of the world 's ecological regions in such areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strategies on forest conservation will also be discussed the conservation of oceans as well as forests will also be high on the agenda .
some 80 percent of the world 's biodiversity is found in forests in tropical regions , experts say , although every minute about 20 hectares -lrb- 50 acres -rrb- of forest disappear . the negotiations will reach a climax in the last three days when senior government officials from 191 countries , including german chancellor angela merkel , join the conference . " we 're at a crossroads with this convention : either we are able to come to concrete and practical results in bonn that revitalize the convention and see our first successes , " said gabriel .
" if we fail here , then the international community has to ask itself why it adopts these conventions in the first place . " delegates will also seek to make progress on so called " benefit sharing , " since developing countries want to be compensated by biotech and pharmaceutical companies eager to tap their natural resources . norway 's environment minister erik solheim told reuters the conference and its aims were something akin to the goal of world peace . " even if we do n't achieve it fully , it 's important to have a target to strive for , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the labor minister said that 's evidence germany needs a minimum wage . thirteen percent of germans live at the poverty level and another 13 percent would as well if it were n't for the country 's social welfare programs , the country 's labor and social affairs minister olaf scholz said in an interview with newspaper bild am sonntag about the government 's latest poverty report , which is to be released on monday , may 19 . " the divide between poor and rich has gotten wider again , " said scholz , adding that single parents and those facing long-term unemployment were most affected . " i find it particularly concerning that the number of those who are employed and still live at the poverty level has risen , " the minister said .
" that shows that our wages are too low in germany and we need a minimum wage . " according to the report , the number of homeless in germany has dropped by 50 percent since 1998 , falling from 530,000 to 254,000 .
but many of those who formerly lived on the street are apparently still living in poverty . the european union defines " poor " as earning less than 60 percent of the average income .
for single people , that means 781 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,217 -rrb- after tax , scholz said .
in contrast , a single person who earns more than 3,418 euros a month after taxes is considered wealthy . " it hurts when you have to count every cent , " said scholz , but the worst part is " when you have the feeling that you ca n't do anything about your situation and do n't have the chance to improve your life . " the minister , from the social democratic party , defended germany 's welfare system and criticized plans by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union to cut taxes , which he said could threaten social welfare . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .
as kahn himself once said , when asked if he had any pets , " the only animal i keep in my home is me . "

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .
as kahn himself once said , when asked if he had any pets , " the only animal i keep in my home is me . "

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .

the labor minister said that 's evidence germany needs a minimum wage . thirteen percent of germans live at the poverty level and another 13 percent would as well if it were n't for the country 's social welfare programs , the country 's labor and social affairs minister olaf scholz said in an interview with newspaper bild am sonntag about the government 's latest poverty report , which is to be released on monday , may 19 . " the divide between poor and rich has gotten wider again , " said scholz , adding that single parents and those facing long-term unemployment were most affected . " i find it particularly concerning that the number of those who are employed and still live at the poverty level has risen , " the minister said .
" that shows that our wages are too low in germany and we need a minimum wage . " according to the report , the number of homeless in germany has dropped by 50 percent since 1998 , falling from 530,000 to 254,000 .
but many of those who formerly lived on the street are apparently still living in poverty . the european union defines " poor " as earning less than 60 percent of the average income .
for single people , that means 781 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,217 -rrb- after tax , scholz said .
in contrast , a single person who earns more than 3,418 euros a month after taxes is considered wealthy . " it hurts when you have to count every cent , " said scholz , but the worst part is " when you have the feeling that you ca n't do anything about your situation and do n't have the chance to improve your life . " the minister , from the social democratic party , defended germany 's welfare system and criticized plans by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union to cut taxes , which he said could threaten social welfare . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .
" they should accept a club 's sporting achievement for what it is , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .
" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .

not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .

the labor minister said that 's evidence germany needs a minimum wage . thirteen percent of germans live at the poverty level and another 13 percent would as well if it were n't for the country 's social welfare programs , the country 's labor and social affairs minister olaf scholz said in an interview with newspaper bild am sonntag about the government 's latest poverty report , which is to be released on monday , may 19 . " the divide between poor and rich has gotten wider again , " said scholz , adding that single parents and those facing long-term unemployment were most affected . " i find it particularly concerning that the number of those who are employed and still live at the poverty level has risen , " the minister said .
" that shows that our wages are too low in germany and we need a minimum wage . " according to the report , the number of homeless in germany has dropped by 50 percent since 1998 , falling from 530,000 to 254,000 .
but many of those who formerly lived on the street are apparently still living in poverty . the european union defines " poor " as earning less than 60 percent of the average income .
for single people , that means 781 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,217 -rrb- after tax , scholz said .
in contrast , a single person who earns more than 3,418 euros a month after taxes is considered wealthy . " it hurts when you have to count every cent , " said scholz , but the worst part is " when you have the feeling that you ca n't do anything about your situation and do n't have the chance to improve your life . " the minister , from the social democratic party , defended germany 's welfare system and criticized plans by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union to cut taxes , which he said could threaten social welfare . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .
" they should accept a club 's sporting achievement for what it is , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .
whether he was being pelted by bananas by opposing supporters -lrb- a reference to his allegedly simian appearance -rrb- , or verbally and physically abusing rivals and sometimes his own teammates , bayern 's number one has never been boring .
as kahn himself once said , when asked if he had any pets , " the only animal i keep in my home is me . "
but now kahn is retired , and the bundesliga wo n't feel the same without him .
maybe better , maybe worse , but in any case different . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when neighboring governments ... are democratic and pro-european , it will certainly lead to better cooperation in the region , " kosovo 's deputy premier hajredin kuchi told britain 's bbc . the government in neighboring macedonia , another ex-yugoslav country that depends heavily on stability in serbia , also welcomed the election result . foreign investment , critical to serbia 's struggling economy , is also riding on the outcome of the coalition talks .

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 18.05.2008 long road ahead for pro-european serbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the radical party , led by tomislav nikolic -lrb- pictured -rrb- , won 29 percent of the vote last week while the latest parliamentary elections gave a big boost to pro-european parties , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . serbia hosts the eurovision song contest next week and its entry , an ethno-tinged love song , is considered one of the favorites to win .
if only serbia 's path to europe were that simple for those who want it . an anti-western government would mean a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing sunday 's election and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high .
for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest of western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . some unhappy with nationalist rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic does n't recognize kosovo independence , but wants serbia to pursue european ties already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government .
who will win - president boris tadic 's pro-european bloc , or nationalists who talk of closer ties to russia - is anybody 's guess . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " said james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , a brussels-based independent think tank . many voters apparently were put off by the anti-western camp 's vicious rhetoric and its echoes of the 1990s , when serbia fought balkan wars under the late strongman slobodan milosevic , who died while on trial at the war crimes tribunal in the hague . after a dirty election campaign that reportedly included death threats against tadic , his bloc defied pre-election polls and won 39 percent of the vote , to 29 percent for the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party . socialists could play pivotal role but milosevic 's socialist party - itself split between pragmatists and hard-liners - emerged as the new kingmaker after sunday 's vote . one scenario making the rounds in belgrade has tadic forming a minority government with tacit support by the socialists . " we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority , " lyon said . under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . nearly eight years after serbs toppled milosevic with mass demonstrations , the west is eager to see serbia end its drift after the balkan wars of the 1990s and make decisive progress toward eu membership - tadic 's main campaign theme . his camp got a huge boost from the eu over the past two weeks with a pre-membership association agreement and a road map for visa-free travel to western europe . italy 's fiat added a sweetener with a 700-million-euro -lrb- $ 1.1-billion -rrb- investment plan for the moribund zastava auto factory , which once made the yugo car but remains a pride of serbian industry . investment dependant on serbia 's path like the nationalists , tadic says he will never recognize kosovo 's independence .
but unlike them , he says serbia still needs to pursue european integration . " when neighboring governments ... are democratic and pro-european , it will certainly lead to better cooperation in the region , " kosovo 's deputy premier hajredin kuchi told britain 's bbc . the government in neighboring macedonia , another ex-yugoslav country that depends heavily on stability in serbia , also welcomed the election result . foreign investment , critical to serbia 's struggling economy , is also riding on the outcome of the coalition talks .
critics say even tadic 's government has been slow to push through reforms while up-and-coming neighbors like romania and bulgaria joined the eu . " quickly forming a government would allow -lsb- serbia -rsb- to catch up in the second half of the year with the missed chances in the economy , because investors have been waiting for months to see what will happen , " former foreign minister goran svilanovic said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if only serbia 's path to europe were that simple for those who want it . an anti-western government would mean a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing sunday 's election and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high .
for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest of western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . some unhappy with nationalist rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic does n't recognize kosovo independence , but wants serbia to pursue european ties already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government .
who will win - president boris tadic 's pro-european bloc , or nationalists who talk of closer ties to russia - is anybody 's guess . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " said james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , a brussels-based independent think tank . many voters apparently were put off by the anti-western camp 's vicious rhetoric and its echoes of the 1990s , when serbia fought balkan wars under the late strongman slobodan milosevic , who died while on trial at the war crimes tribunal in the hague . after a dirty election campaign that reportedly included death threats against tadic , his bloc defied pre-election polls and won 39 percent of the vote , to 29 percent for the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party . socialists could play pivotal role but milosevic 's socialist party - itself split between pragmatists and hard-liners - emerged as the new kingmaker after sunday 's vote . one scenario making the rounds in belgrade has tadic forming a minority government with tacit support by the socialists . " we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority , " lyon said . under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . nearly eight years after serbs toppled milosevic with mass demonstrations , the west is eager to see serbia end its drift after the balkan wars of the 1990s and make decisive progress toward eu membership - tadic 's main campaign theme . his camp got a huge boost from the eu over the past two weeks with a pre-membership association agreement and a road map for visa-free travel to western europe . italy 's fiat added a sweetener with a 700-million-euro -lrb- $ 1.1-billion -rrb- investment plan for the moribund zastava auto factory , which once made the yugo car but remains a pride of serbian industry . investment dependant on serbia 's path like the nationalists , tadic says he will never recognize kosovo 's independence .
but unlike them , he says serbia still needs to pursue european integration . " when neighboring governments ... are democratic and pro-european , it will certainly lead to better cooperation in the region , " kosovo 's deputy premier hajredin kuchi told britain 's bbc . the government in neighboring macedonia , another ex-yugoslav country that depends heavily on stability in serbia , also welcomed the election result . foreign investment , critical to serbia 's struggling economy , is also riding on the outcome of the coalition talks .
critics say even tadic 's government has been slow to push through reforms while up-and-coming neighbors like romania and bulgaria joined the eu . " quickly forming a government would allow -lsb- serbia -rsb- to catch up in the second half of the year with the missed chances in the economy , because investors have been waiting for months to see what will happen , " former foreign minister goran svilanovic said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .
" they should accept a club 's sporting achievement for what it is , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the labor minister said that 's evidence germany needs a minimum wage . thirteen percent of germans live at the poverty level and another 13 percent would as well if it were n't for the country 's social welfare programs , the country 's labor and social affairs minister olaf scholz said in an interview with newspaper bild am sonntag about the government 's latest poverty report , which is to be released on monday , may 19 . " the divide between poor and rich has gotten wider again , " said scholz , adding that single parents and those facing long-term unemployment were most affected . " i find it particularly concerning that the number of those who are employed and still live at the poverty level has risen , " the minister said .
" that shows that our wages are too low in germany and we need a minimum wage . " according to the report , the number of homeless in germany has dropped by 50 percent since 1998 , falling from 530,000 to 254,000 .
but many of those who formerly lived on the street are apparently still living in poverty . the european union defines " poor " as earning less than 60 percent of the average income .
for single people , that means 781 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,217 -rrb- after tax , scholz said .
in contrast , a single person who earns more than 3,418 euros a month after taxes is considered wealthy . " it hurts when you have to count every cent , " said scholz , but the worst part is " when you have the feeling that you ca n't do anything about your situation and do n't have the chance to improve your life .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .
" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .
i regularly talk with religious leaders .
why not with the dalai lama ? "

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .
" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .
i regularly talk with religious leaders .
why not with the dalai lama ? "
wieczorek-zeul told spiegel online .
" it is the development ministry 's job to promote dialogue between religions and to strengthen civil society around the world . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .
" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .
i regularly talk with religious leaders .
why not with the dalai lama ? "
wieczorek-zeul told spiegel online .
" it is the development ministry 's job to promote dialogue between religions and to strengthen civil society around the world . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 18.05.2008 long road ahead for pro-european serbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the radical party , led by tomislav nikolic -lrb- pictured -rrb- , won 29 percent of the vote last week while the latest parliamentary elections gave a big boost to pro-european parties , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . serbia hosts the eurovision song contest next week and its entry , an ethno-tinged love song , is considered one of the favorites to win .
if only serbia 's path to europe were that simple for those who want it . an anti-western government would mean a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing sunday 's election and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high .
for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest of western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . some unhappy with nationalist rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic does n't recognize kosovo independence , but wants serbia to pursue european ties already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government .
who will win - president boris tadic 's pro-european bloc , or nationalists who talk of closer ties to russia - is anybody 's guess . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " said james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , a brussels-based independent think tank . many voters apparently were put off by the anti-western camp 's vicious rhetoric and its echoes of the 1990s , when serbia fought balkan wars under the late strongman slobodan milosevic , who died while on trial at the war crimes tribunal in the hague . after a dirty election campaign that reportedly included death threats against tadic , his bloc defied pre-election polls and won 39 percent of the vote , to 29 percent for the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party . socialists could play pivotal role but milosevic 's socialist party - itself split between pragmatists and hard-liners - emerged as the new kingmaker after sunday 's vote . one scenario making the rounds in belgrade has tadic forming a minority government with tacit support by the socialists . " we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority , " lyon said . under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . nearly eight years after serbs toppled milosevic with mass demonstrations , the west is eager to see serbia end its drift after the balkan wars of the 1990s and make decisive progress toward eu membership - tadic 's main campaign theme . his camp got a huge boost from the eu over the past two weeks with a pre-membership association agreement and a road map for visa-free travel to western europe . italy 's fiat added a sweetener with a 700-million-euro -lrb- $ 1.1-billion -rrb- investment plan for the moribund zastava auto factory , which once made the yugo car but remains a pride of serbian industry . investment dependant on serbia 's path like the nationalists , tadic says he will never recognize kosovo 's independence .
but unlike them , he says serbia still needs to pursue european integration . " when neighboring governments ... are democratic and pro-european , it will certainly lead to better cooperation in the region , " kosovo 's deputy premier hajredin kuchi told britain 's bbc . the government in neighboring macedonia , another ex-yugoslav country that depends heavily on stability in serbia , also welcomed the election result . foreign investment , critical to serbia 's struggling economy , is also riding on the outcome of the coalition talks .
critics say even tadic 's government has been slow to push through reforms while up-and-coming neighbors like romania and bulgaria joined the eu . " quickly forming a government would allow -lsb- serbia -rsb- to catch up in the second half of the year with the missed chances in the economy , because investors have been waiting for months to see what will happen , " former foreign minister goran svilanovic said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .
" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .
i regularly talk with religious leaders .

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .

experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .
we need an unprecedented effort to meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , " the executive secretary of the un biodiversity convention , ahmed djoghlaf , told reuters . he said consumption has reached unsustainable levels and without a change in behaviour , feeding nine billion people , the estimated world population in 2050 , would be difficult . deforestation - a huge factor in species loss and global carbon emissions contributing to climate change - is a central theme of this year 's conference in bonn , formerly the capital of west german . one in four mammal species , one in eight among birds , a third of amphibian creatures and 70 percent of all plant life made the most recent endangered list issued by another un agency , the world conservation union -lrb- wcu -rrb- . real economic losses experts say the loss of global biodiversity also has tangible effects on the world economy . ahead of the un meeting , germany 's der spiegel news magazine quoted from a report which said the destruction of flora and fauna is costing the world two trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 trillion -rrb- a year , or six percent of its overall gross national product . the european union and german environment ministry-led research , entitled " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " will be presented on monday at the un conference . in its edition out monday , der spiegel will present extracts from the paper , with the study 's lead author , pavan sukhdev , a senior figure with deutsche bank in india , writing that " the world 's poor bear the brunt of the cost . " agreements on conservation the meeting , which runs for two weeks , will see delegates talking about ways to boost and coordinate " protected areas " to conserve natural habitats .
the convention has set a goal to safeguard at least 10 percent of the world 's ecological regions in such areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strategies on forest conservation will also be discussed the conservation of oceans as well as forests will also be high on the agenda .
some 80 percent of the world 's biodiversity is found in forests in tropical regions , experts say , although every minute about 20 hectares -lrb- 50 acres -rrb- of forest disappear . the negotiations will reach a climax in the last three days when senior government officials from 191 countries , including german chancellor angela merkel , join the conference . " we 're at a crossroads with this convention : either we are able to come to concrete and practical results in bonn that revitalize the convention and see our first successes , " said gabriel .
" if we fail here , then the international community has to ask itself why it adopts these conventions in the first place . " delegates will also seek to make progress on so called " benefit sharing , " since developing countries want to be compensated by biotech and pharmaceutical companies eager to tap their natural resources . norway 's environment minister erik solheim told reuters the conference and its aims were something akin to the goal of world peace .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .

beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .
" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .
i regularly talk with religious leaders .
why not with the dalai lama ? "
wieczorek-zeul told spiegel online .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .

and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .
" they should accept a club 's sporting achievement for what it is , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .
" they should accept a club 's sporting achievement for what it is , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .
if the pacific yew , a tree or shrub , vanishes , so does an active ingredient in cancer treatment .
the bark of the white willow contains a raw material of aspirin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel will open the conference some one-half of approved medicines in germany are based on plant material .
on a global scale , it is estimated that 40 percent of world trade involves biological processes and products .
whether food , medicines , nutrients or green energy , without biodiversity they are not possible .
experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .
we need an unprecedented effort to meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , " the executive secretary of the un biodiversity convention , ahmed djoghlaf , told reuters . he said consumption has reached unsustainable levels and without a change in behaviour , feeding nine billion people , the estimated world population in 2050 , would be difficult . deforestation - a huge factor in species loss and global carbon emissions contributing to climate change - is a central theme of this year 's conference in bonn , formerly the capital of west german . one in four mammal species , one in eight among birds , a third of amphibian creatures and 70 percent of all plant life made the most recent endangered list issued by another un agency , the world conservation union -lrb- wcu -rrb- . real economic losses experts say the loss of global biodiversity also has tangible effects on the world economy . ahead of the un meeting , germany 's der spiegel news magazine quoted from a report which said the destruction of flora and fauna is costing the world two trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 trillion -rrb- a year , or six percent of its overall gross national product . the european union and german environment ministry-led research , entitled " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " will be presented on monday at the un conference . in its edition out monday , der spiegel will present extracts from the paper , with the study 's lead author , pavan sukhdev , a senior figure with deutsche bank in india , writing that " the world 's poor bear the brunt of the cost . " agreements on conservation the meeting , which runs for two weeks , will see delegates talking about ways to boost and coordinate " protected areas " to conserve natural habitats .
the convention has set a goal to safeguard at least 10 percent of the world 's ecological regions in such areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strategies on forest conservation will also be discussed the conservation of oceans as well as forests will also be high on the agenda .
some 80 percent of the world 's biodiversity is found in forests in tropical regions , experts say , although every minute about 20 hectares -lrb- 50 acres -rrb- of forest disappear . the negotiations will reach a climax in the last three days when senior government officials from 191 countries , including german chancellor angela merkel , join the conference . " we 're at a crossroads with this convention : either we are able to come to concrete and practical results in bonn that revitalize the convention and see our first successes , " said gabriel .
" if we fail here , then the international community has to ask itself why it adopts these conventions in the first place . " delegates will also seek to make progress on so called " benefit sharing , " since developing countries want to be compensated by biotech and pharmaceutical companies eager to tap their natural resources . norway 's environment minister erik solheim told reuters the conference and its aims were something akin to the goal of world peace . " even if we do n't achieve it fully , it 's important to have a target to strive for , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the labor minister said that 's evidence germany needs a minimum wage . thirteen percent of germans live at the poverty level and another 13 percent would as well if it were n't for the country 's social welfare programs , the country 's labor and social affairs minister olaf scholz said in an interview with newspaper bild am sonntag about the government 's latest poverty report , which is to be released on monday , may 19 . " the divide between poor and rich has gotten wider again , " said scholz , adding that single parents and those facing long-term unemployment were most affected . " i find it particularly concerning that the number of those who are employed and still live at the poverty level has risen , " the minister said .
" that shows that our wages are too low in germany and we need a minimum wage . " according to the report , the number of homeless in germany has dropped by 50 percent since 1998 , falling from 530,000 to 254,000 .
but many of those who formerly lived on the street are apparently still living in poverty . the european union defines " poor " as earning less than 60 percent of the average income .
for single people , that means 781 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,217 -rrb- after tax , scholz said .
in contrast , a single person who earns more than 3,418 euros a month after taxes is considered wealthy . " it hurts when you have to count every cent , " said scholz , but the worst part is " when you have the feeling that you ca n't do anything about your situation and do n't have the chance to improve your life . " the minister , from the social democratic party , defended germany 's welfare system and criticized plans by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union to cut taxes , which he said could threaten social welfare . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .
" they should accept a club 's sporting achievement for what it is , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .

fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .

and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .

when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .

with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .

in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .

" we need all the different religions to serve the people , because the people are different and have different goals , " the 72-year-old nobel peace laureate said during his appearance at the nuremberg arena .
germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke , also addressed the crowd and renewed calls for negotiations between the chinese government and tibetan leaders over the administration of tibet .
nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .

nooke said such negotiations could be organized through " diplomatic skill and public pressure . "
not seeking tibetan independence on saturday , the tibetan spiritual leader spoke to a crowd of 2,500 people in moenchengladbach , saying he will continue to repeat his message of freedom for tibetans until the unrest in his homeland remains unsolved .
earlier this week , the dalai lama told a news conference in the western german city of bochum he was not seeking independence for tibet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama spelled out his position on tibet in bochum " we want to live in peace with our chinese brothers and sisters , " he said .
" we are not seeking independence , " but merely greater autonomy and more respect for tibet culture , religion and language , he added .
the dalai lama will give speeches in the town of bamberg in the southern german state of bavaria on sunday , before arriving in berlin .
german rock bands " wir sind helden " and " 2raumwohnung " will celebrate the buddhist leader 's visit by performing live , alongside tibetan singer ani choyling .
the dalai lama is scheduled to address a pro-tibet rally in berlin and meet with development aid minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , the highest-ranking german official to meet with the buddhist leader during his visit .
meeting marked by controversy the run-up to the visit was marked by a domestic row because no one in the german cabinet was initially prepared to meet him , apparently fearing it could upset china .
chancellor merkel is currently in latin america and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , a social democrat , has declined to meet with the tibetan leader as has german president horst koehler .
steinmeier defended his objections by saying , " it takes a lot of courage not to meet with the dalai lama these days . "
merkel met with the dalai lama at the chancellery during his last visit to germany in september , a move that led to a chill in relations with china .
spd chief angered by planned meet though wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , is set to receive tibet 's exiled spiritual leader in a berlin hotel on monday , rather than at her ministry , the event has reportedly also angered the social democratic party 's -lrb- spd -rrb- president kurt beck who is said to have been unaware of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiezorek-zeul has stirred controversy by meeting with the dalai lama " none of us knew that heidemarie wiezorek-zeul wanted to meet with the dalai lama , " beck was quoted by newspaper welt am sonntag as saying on sunday in the northern german city of luebeck .
beck criticized the planned meeting , saying wieczorek-zeul was putting the spd on the defensive .
china has formally protested wieczorek-zeul 's planned meeting , according to a spokesman at the german foreign ministry . " we object to a member of the german government receiving the dalai lama and to germany allowing him to carry out this visit , " junhui zhang from the chinese embassy in berlin told newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . he also said in an interview with television broadcaster ard that giving the dalai lama an official reception violates germany 's " one-china policy , " which a spokesman for chancellor angela merkel denied . development aid minister heidemarie wiezorek-zeul defended her meeting with the dalai lama recently .
" i do n't understand the excitement about the meeting with the dalai lama .
i regularly talk with religious leaders .
why not with the dalai lama ? "
wieczorek-zeul told spiegel online .
" it is the development ministry 's job to promote dialogue between religions and to strengthen civil society around the world . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel said the probe showed that the justice system was working . the german chancellor indicated that she would like to meet with the state 's attorney for a briefing about the investigations . merkel 's stop in colombia followed the eu-latin america-caribbean summit in lima , which concluded saturday . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .
" they should accept a club 's sporting achievement for what it is , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick had much to celebrate " it 's a very special day for the region , " rangnick said .
hoffenheim join borussia moenchengladbach and cologne , who were already assured of promotion .
former top-flight club kaiserslautern meanwhile avoided relegation to the third division with a 3-0 win over cologne .
kickers offenbach , sc paderborn , erzgebirge aue and carl zeiss jena are the four teams relegated .
rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .
the club has since been dubbed germany 's " richest village team , " thanks to the big-money backing of soccer-crazy hopp , 68 .
sap , europe 's largest software firm , has its headquarters not far away in walldorf near heidelberg .
big bucks promotion to the second division last year was remarkable enough , but hoffenheim have now done better than even hopp had imagined .
the billionaire had hoped for a period of consolidation in what has probably been the strongest second tier in germany for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hopp with his boys now he can look forward to world cup winners like bayern 's luca toni visiting the tiny club who hope to have a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to ready by early next year .
" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of beckenbauer 's , seems to have applied his keen business acumen to revamping the club , hiring some of germany 's best coaches and buying young talented players from africa .
former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 .
at the helm now is ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke .
and if hopp 's plans bear fruit , hoffenheim are also going to be a big name in german soccer .
hopp says he will be investing in some new players for the next season but only in three or four positions .
he wants the club to develop its own talent , and with this in mind has invested millions in training centres .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp had been quoted as saying .
envious critics " for now we are simply happy , " hopp said after sunday 's game .
" it is going to be difficult enough for us in the bundesliga . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
but hopp dismissed this as the hoffenheim players celebrated wildly after clinching promotion , saying fans should focus on their own clubs rather than be envious of others .

the victory by the team led by coach ralf rangnick , led to euphoria in hoffenheim , close to heidelberg and which is home to just 3,300 people .

rags to riches hoffenheim 's remarkable rise from amateur obscurity into the top echelons of professional german soccer , where they will be competing next season with the likes of bayern munich , werder bremen and schalke 04 , reads like a rags-to-riches tale .
at the end of the 1980s , the village sports club was home to nothing more than a team of weekend amateurs kicking in the local eighth division .
most germans would be at a loss even to locate hoffenheim on the map .
little more than a district of the small town of sinsheim , between heilbronn and mannheim , it is hardly the cradle of soccer .
but things changed in 1989 when dietmar hopp , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap and one of germany 's richest men , donated 10,000 german marks -lrb- 5,000 euros -rrb- to the local club he used to play for so that they could buy balls , track suits and other items .

" it will take some getting used to , " bayern munich president franz beckenbauer said .

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .
if the pacific yew , a tree or shrub , vanishes , so does an active ingredient in cancer treatment .
the bark of the white willow contains a raw material of aspirin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel will open the conference some one-half of approved medicines in germany are based on plant material .
on a global scale , it is estimated that 40 percent of world trade involves biological processes and products .
whether food , medicines , nutrients or green energy , without biodiversity they are not possible .
experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .
we need an unprecedented effort to meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , " the executive secretary of the un biodiversity convention , ahmed djoghlaf , told reuters . he said consumption has reached unsustainable levels and without a change in behaviour , feeding nine billion people , the estimated world population in 2050 , would be difficult . deforestation - a huge factor in species loss and global carbon emissions contributing to climate change - is a central theme of this year 's conference in bonn , formerly the capital of west german . one in four mammal species , one in eight among birds , a third of amphibian creatures and 70 percent of all plant life made the most recent endangered list issued by another un agency , the world conservation union -lrb- wcu -rrb- . real economic losses experts say the loss of global biodiversity also has tangible effects on the world economy . ahead of the un meeting , germany 's der spiegel news magazine quoted from a report which said the destruction of flora and fauna is costing the world two trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 trillion -rrb- a year , or six percent of its overall gross national product . the european union and german environment ministry-led research , entitled " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " will be presented on monday at the un conference . in its edition out monday , der spiegel will present extracts from the paper , with the study 's lead author , pavan sukhdev , a senior figure with deutsche bank in india , writing that " the world 's poor bear the brunt of the cost . " agreements on conservation the meeting , which runs for two weeks , will see delegates talking about ways to boost and coordinate " protected areas " to conserve natural habitats .
the convention has set a goal to safeguard at least 10 percent of the world 's ecological regions in such areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strategies on forest conservation will also be discussed the conservation of oceans as well as forests will also be high on the agenda .
some 80 percent of the world 's biodiversity is found in forests in tropical regions , experts say , although every minute about 20 hectares -lrb- 50 acres -rrb- of forest disappear . the negotiations will reach a climax in the last three days when senior government officials from 191 countries , including german chancellor angela merkel , join the conference . " we 're at a crossroads with this convention : either we are able to come to concrete and practical results in bonn that revitalize the convention and see our first successes , " said gabriel .
" if we fail here , then the international community has to ask itself why it adopts these conventions in the first place . " delegates will also seek to make progress on so called " benefit sharing , " since developing countries want to be compensated by biotech and pharmaceutical companies eager to tap their natural resources . norway 's environment minister erik solheim told reuters the conference and its aims were something akin to the goal of world peace . " even if we do n't achieve it fully , it 's important to have a target to strive for , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 18.05.2008 long road ahead for pro-european serbs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the radical party , led by tomislav nikolic -lrb- pictured -rrb- , won 29 percent of the vote last week while the latest parliamentary elections gave a big boost to pro-european parties , serbia 's fragmented politics mean the vote could still produce a nationalist , anti-western government . serbia hosts the eurovision song contest next week and its entry , an ethno-tinged love song , is considered one of the favorites to win .
if only serbia 's path to europe were that simple for those who want it . an anti-western government would mean a setback for the european union , which invested considerable effort in influencing sunday 's election and urged the next government to pursue " a clear european agenda . " as political leaders began coalition talks monday , the stakes for regional stability , the eu and ordinary serbs were high .
for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .
they want to steer serbia away from the eu in protest of western support of kosovo 's february declaration of independence . some unhappy with nationalist rhetoric bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic does n't recognize kosovo independence , but wants serbia to pursue european ties already , serbs are contemplating the prospect of a long , uncertain summer of bargaining to form the new government .
who will win - president boris tadic 's pro-european bloc , or nationalists who talk of closer ties to russia - is anybody 's guess . " it 's about fifty-fifty , " said james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , a brussels-based independent think tank . many voters apparently were put off by the anti-western camp 's vicious rhetoric and its echoes of the 1990s , when serbia fought balkan wars under the late strongman slobodan milosevic , who died while on trial at the war crimes tribunal in the hague . after a dirty election campaign that reportedly included death threats against tadic , his bloc defied pre-election polls and won 39 percent of the vote , to 29 percent for the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party . socialists could play pivotal role but milosevic 's socialist party - itself split between pragmatists and hard-liners - emerged as the new kingmaker after sunday 's vote . one scenario making the rounds in belgrade has tadic forming a minority government with tacit support by the socialists . " we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority , " lyon said . under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . nearly eight years after serbs toppled milosevic with mass demonstrations , the west is eager to see serbia end its drift after the balkan wars of the 1990s and make decisive progress toward eu membership - tadic 's main campaign theme . his camp got a huge boost from the eu over the past two weeks with a pre-membership association agreement and a road map for visa-free travel to western europe . italy 's fiat added a sweetener with a 700-million-euro -lrb- $ 1.1-billion -rrb- investment plan for the moribund zastava auto factory , which once made the yugo car but remains a pride of serbian industry . investment dependant on serbia 's path like the nationalists , tadic says he will never recognize kosovo 's independence .
but unlike them , he says serbia still needs to pursue european integration . " when neighboring governments ... are democratic and pro-european , it will certainly lead to better cooperation in the region , " kosovo 's deputy premier hajredin kuchi told britain 's bbc . the government in neighboring macedonia , another ex-yugoslav country that depends heavily on stability in serbia , also welcomed the election result . foreign investment , critical to serbia 's struggling economy , is also riding on the outcome of the coalition talks .
critics say even tadic 's government has been slow to push through reforms while up-and-coming neighbors like romania and bulgaria joined the eu . " quickly forming a government would allow -lsb- serbia -rsb- to catch up in the second half of the year with the missed chances in the economy , because investors have been waiting for months to see what will happen , " former foreign minister goran svilanovic said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .
if the pacific yew , a tree or shrub , vanishes , so does an active ingredient in cancer treatment .
the bark of the white willow contains a raw material of aspirin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel will open the conference some one-half of approved medicines in germany are based on plant material .
on a global scale , it is estimated that 40 percent of world trade involves biological processes and products .
whether food , medicines , nutrients or green energy , without biodiversity they are not possible .
experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .
we need an unprecedented effort to meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , " the executive secretary of the un biodiversity convention , ahmed djoghlaf , told reuters . he said consumption has reached unsustainable levels and without a change in behaviour , feeding nine billion people , the estimated world population in 2050 , would be difficult . deforestation - a huge factor in species loss and global carbon emissions contributing to climate change - is a central theme of this year 's conference in bonn , formerly the capital of west german . one in four mammal species , one in eight among birds , a third of amphibian creatures and 70 percent of all plant life made the most recent endangered list issued by another un agency , the world conservation union -lrb- wcu -rrb- . real economic losses experts say the loss of global biodiversity also has tangible effects on the world economy . ahead of the un meeting , germany 's der spiegel news magazine quoted from a report which said the destruction of flora and fauna is costing the world two trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 trillion -rrb- a year , or six percent of its overall gross national product . the european union and german environment ministry-led research , entitled " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " will be presented on monday at the un conference . in its edition out monday , der spiegel will present extracts from the paper , with the study 's lead author , pavan sukhdev , a senior figure with deutsche bank in india , writing that " the world 's poor bear the brunt of the cost . " agreements on conservation the meeting , which runs for two weeks , will see delegates talking about ways to boost and coordinate " protected areas " to conserve natural habitats .
the convention has set a goal to safeguard at least 10 percent of the world 's ecological regions in such areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strategies on forest conservation will also be discussed the conservation of oceans as well as forests will also be high on the agenda .
some 80 percent of the world 's biodiversity is found in forests in tropical regions , experts say , although every minute about 20 hectares -lrb- 50 acres -rrb- of forest disappear . the negotiations will reach a climax in the last three days when senior government officials from 191 countries , including german chancellor angela merkel , join the conference . " we 're at a crossroads with this convention : either we are able to come to concrete and practical results in bonn that revitalize the convention and see our first successes , " said gabriel .
" if we fail here , then the international community has to ask itself why it adopts these conventions in the first place . " delegates will also seek to make progress on so called " benefit sharing , " since developing countries want to be compensated by biotech and pharmaceutical companies eager to tap their natural resources . norway 's environment minister erik solheim told reuters the conference and its aims were something akin to the goal of world peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 18.05.2008 bundesliga : ten lessons from the 2007-8 season großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's investment in toni paid off big time this year 's bundesliga campaign did n't go down to the wire like its predecessor , but it did have its own - often bizarre - dynamic .
dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .

dw-world looked back at what was learned over the course of 34 league matches . ante up to win bayern munich took the league title with relative ease because they got out their checkbook and spent big in the off-season .
the motors behind the club 's 20th or 21st league championship , depending on how one reckons it , were striker luca toni and playmaker franck ribery , who cost the bavarians more than 30 million euros -lrb- $ 47 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
toni led the league in goals , and ribery provided most of the creativity in an otherwise lackluster midfield .
had munich not splashed out big for them in the summer of 2007 , they likely would n't have been celebrating in the spring of 2008 .
bremen have the best coach thomas schaaf did n't take the title , but he did get second-placed werder bremen back in the champions league .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year will be schaaf 's tenth as bremen coach in doing so , he had to compensate for the loss of his best striker , miroslav klose , who left for bayern .
and werder 's biggest off-season signing , carlos alberto turned out to be a total bust who refused to play because of insomnia -lrb- ! -rrb- and was shipped back to brazil after a number of disciplinary problems .
nonetheless , schaaf had the men in green playing , as usual , the most attractive attacking football in the league .
wolfsburg 's is n't bad , either a lot of fans shook their heads when former bayern coach felix magath agreed to become both coach and manager at perennial also-rans wolfsburg .
but despite completely revamping the squad , magath led the wolves to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup - the best finish in club history .
magath got the blend between veterans and youngsters spot on this season , and with a bit of experience , the team could do even better next time round .
success sometimes is n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka had no reason to hang his head under coach mirko slomka , schalke went further than ever before in the champions league , and the team qualified for that competition again this season .
so what did he get in return ?
fired - six rounds before the end of the season .
that made him the latest victim of schalke 's frustration at failing to win a league crown in half a century . hans mayer can sympathize .
in 2007 , he won the german cup with nuremberg in 2007 - the club 's biggest triumph in four decades .
in february he was given the axe .
foolishly , as it turned out .
nuremberg were relegated on the final day of play .
when in doubt , blow your top … bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doll let off some serious steam at the press conference with so much injustice in the world , it 's no wonder that coaches have hissy-fits ever now and then .
and dortmund 's thomas doll threw a pretty good one in april .
annoyed by media questions about why one of the league 's biggest clubs was hovering just above the drop zone , doll turned on reporters with a diatribe regularly , if oddly , punctuated with the phrase , " i 'm laughing my a * * off . "
surprisingly , doll 's outburst worked .
dortmund went on an undefeated streak to avoid going down , and doll himself became a minor star on youtube . and then dortmund canned him . … or just be incoherent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre let his players do the talking in berlin hertha berlin 's season was similar to dortmund 's , a tedious journey mostly through the bottom half of the table .
but berlin 's coach lucien favre , who 's from francophone switzerland , took a different tack .
when pressed by journalists , he would simply stare as though he had n't understood the question and then mumble answers that seemed to have been translated from the french by babelfish .
monsieur favre 's strategy worked , too .
the normally bloodthirsty media in berlin let him complete a disappointing season in relative peace .
aging stars are not the answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton did n't exactly look svelte at duisburg if you 're a small club whose main goal is to stay up , the last thing you want to do is bring in a long-in-tooth striker whose glory days came years ago for a bigger bundesliga club .
case in point 1 : duisburg .
the zebras brought in former bremen great ailton to pep up their attack .
but the brazilian showed up with some excess weight and was let go in winter , having scored only one goal .
case in point 2 : hansa rostock .
rostock brought back victor agali , whose greatest triumphs were with schalke , to provide a strong presence in the middle of the box .
but he lost his sense of the goal , only scoring once the entire season .
in the end , both duisburg and rostock went down .
do n't always play hurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waechter probably should have handed on the yellow jersey rostock keeper stefan waechter learned this lesson against cottbus in late april .
wächter tore ligaments in his knee late in the tight match .
with the game tied at 1-all , and rostock having used up their three substitutions , the keeper bravely stayed between the posts .
but his injury rendered him so immobile that he was unable to reach a rather ordinary , added-time header .
the 2-1 loss to a fellow relegation candidate was the beginning of hansa 's eventual demise .
keep your head down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ball came back to haunt rowen fernandez the unluckiest player this season had to be bielefeld keeper rowen fernandez .
in the second-to-last round , with bielefeld leading dortmund 2-1 in the final ten minutes , a free kick whistled past fernandez 's ear , ricocheted off the post , hit the keeper square in the face and bounced back into the goal for the equalizer .
had bielefeld won that match , their relegation worries would have been over .
but all 's well that ends well - bielefeld were saved on the season 's final day .
we 'll miss ollie kahn … maybe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn does his world-famous klaus kinski impression for twenty years , " king kahn " has amused german football fans on and off the pitch .

for serbia 's neighbors , including newly seceded kosovo , an ultra-nationalist leadership in belgrade would likely spell a new rush of tension . for the average serb , living on $ 500 a month , the prospect of joining the rich club of european union nations has obvious appeal . but the loss of kosovo and anti-western resentment rooted in nato 's 1999 airstrikes on belgrade helped keep hard-line parties in the game .

" it 's about fifty-fifty , " said james lyon , a balkans expert with international crisis group , a brussels-based independent think tank . many voters apparently were put off by the anti-western camp 's vicious rhetoric and its echoes of the 1990s , when serbia fought balkan wars under the late strongman slobodan milosevic , who died while on trial at the war crimes tribunal in the hague . after a dirty election campaign that reportedly included death threats against tadic , his bloc defied pre-election polls and won 39 percent of the vote , to 29 percent for the ultra-nationalist serbian radical party . socialists could play pivotal role but milosevic 's socialist party - itself split between pragmatists and hard-liners - emerged as the new kingmaker after sunday 's vote . one scenario making the rounds in belgrade has tadic forming a minority government with tacit support by the socialists . " we could once again have a government that is very weak , very unstable and very much at the mercy of the natural parliamentary majority - which is a nationalist majority , " lyon said . under the constitution , serbs have a month to constitute the new parliament and three months after that to form a new government . nearly eight years after serbs toppled milosevic with mass demonstrations , the west is eager to see serbia end its drift after the balkan wars of the 1990s and make decisive progress toward eu membership - tadic 's main campaign theme . his camp got a huge boost from the eu over the past two weeks with a pre-membership association agreement and a road map for visa-free travel to western europe . italy 's fiat added a sweetener with a 700-million-euro -lrb- $ 1.1-billion -rrb- investment plan for the moribund zastava auto factory , which once made the yugo car but remains a pride of serbian industry . investment dependant on serbia 's path like the nationalists , tadic says he will never recognize kosovo 's independence .
but unlike them , he says serbia still needs to pursue european integration . " when neighboring governments ... are democratic and pro-european , it will certainly lead to better cooperation in the region , " kosovo 's deputy premier hajredin kuchi told britain 's bbc . the government in neighboring macedonia , another ex-yugoslav country that depends heavily on stability in serbia , also welcomed the election result . foreign investment , critical to serbia 's struggling economy , is also riding on the outcome of the coalition talks .
critics say even tadic 's government has been slow to push through reforms while up-and-coming neighbors like romania and bulgaria joined the eu . " quickly forming a government would allow -lsb- serbia -rsb- to catch up in the second half of the year with the missed chances in the economy , because investors have been waiting for months to see what will happen , " former foreign minister goran svilanovic said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's estimated that three species vanish every hour , largely as a result of human activity , such as rising populations , pollution and climate change . " we are at one thousand or even ten thousand times the speed of the natural extinction rate , purely because of human influence , " sigmar gabriel , the german environment minister who will open the conference , told deutsche welle . practical fall-out the disappearance of these plant and animal species is not just negative on a philosophical level , experts say , their absence has very real-world effects .
if the pacific yew , a tree or shrub , vanishes , so does an active ingredient in cancer treatment .
the bark of the white willow contains a raw material of aspirin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german environment minister sigmar gabriel will open the conference some one-half of approved medicines in germany are based on plant material .
on a global scale , it is estimated that 40 percent of world trade involves biological processes and products .
whether food , medicines , nutrients or green energy , without biodiversity they are not possible .
experts say the loss of plant species could be catastrophic for long-term food supplies . " we hope to give a wake-up to humanity .
we need an unprecedented effort to meet the challenge of biodiversity loss , " the executive secretary of the un biodiversity convention , ahmed djoghlaf , told reuters . he said consumption has reached unsustainable levels and without a change in behaviour , feeding nine billion people , the estimated world population in 2050 , would be difficult . deforestation - a huge factor in species loss and global carbon emissions contributing to climate change - is a central theme of this year 's conference in bonn , formerly the capital of west german . one in four mammal species , one in eight among birds , a third of amphibian creatures and 70 percent of all plant life made the most recent endangered list issued by another un agency , the world conservation union -lrb- wcu -rrb- . real economic losses experts say the loss of global biodiversity also has tangible effects on the world economy . ahead of the un meeting , germany 's der spiegel news magazine quoted from a report which said the destruction of flora and fauna is costing the world two trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 trillion -rrb- a year , or six percent of its overall gross national product . the european union and german environment ministry-led research , entitled " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " will be presented on monday at the un conference . in its edition out monday , der spiegel will present extracts from the paper , with the study 's lead author , pavan sukhdev , a senior figure with deutsche bank in india , writing that " the world 's poor bear the brunt of the cost . " agreements on conservation the meeting , which runs for two weeks , will see delegates talking about ways to boost and coordinate " protected areas " to conserve natural habitats .
the convention has set a goal to safeguard at least 10 percent of the world 's ecological regions in such areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strategies on forest conservation will also be discussed the conservation of oceans as well as forests will also be high on the agenda .
some 80 percent of the world 's biodiversity is found in forests in tropical regions , experts say , although every minute about 20 hectares -lrb- 50 acres -rrb- of forest disappear . the negotiations will reach a climax in the last three days when senior government officials from 191 countries , including german chancellor angela merkel , join the conference . " we 're at a crossroads with this convention : either we are able to come to concrete and practical results in bonn that revitalize the convention and see our first successes , " said gabriel .
" if we fail here , then the international community has to ask itself why it adopts these conventions in the first place . " delegates will also seek to make progress on so called " benefit sharing , " since developing countries want to be compensated by biotech and pharmaceutical companies eager to tap their natural resources . norway 's environment minister erik solheim told reuters the conference and its aims were something akin to the goal of world peace . " even if we do n't achieve it fully , it 's important to have a target to strive for , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

transact told bbc radio 5 live the credit crunch was leaving many professionals and homeowners unable to cope with their debts .
it said demand for advice was rising across the country , but the increase was dramatic in middle-class areas .
the organisation represents more than 1,200 debt advice centres .
in haywards heath in sussex and congleton in cheshire , for example , there had been a 100 % rise in inquiries over the past year .
it said some advice centres were so busy they had been turning people away .
benefits transact says government funding has been generous , with an extra £ 55 million over the past three years to fund an extra 500 debt advisers .
but it says this has been concentrated on inner-city areas where the rise in problem debt has been less severe . "
these services now with the credit crunch are being overwhelmed by a whole new breed of debtor : middle-class people " jamie elliott transact co-ordinator transact co-ordinator jamie elliott told the bbc that debt advisers were seeing a new type of client .
" in the past it was almost uniquely people on benefits , people in social housing who went to debt advice agencies .
" since the credit crunch started , they are seeing a big increase in professional people and homeowners coming to seek help , who have just been pushed over the edge and now ca n't cope with their outgoings .
" these services now with the credit crunch are being overwhelmed by a whole new breed of debtor : middle-class people .
" but what that means is there is much less debt advice to go round . "
tougher lending many of the people transact sees have taken advantage of easy access to credit or extended mortgages to pay for home improvements or just general spending .
but in recent months lenders have become much tougher and less willing to be flexible over repayments . "
i 've had at least two clients sit in front of me and tell me they would have killed themselves if they had n't found out we were here " emma russell senior debt adviser and with fixed-rate mortgages coming to an end , higher fuel costs , food bills and council tax , it says many people with decent salaries are struggling .
transact expects the problem to get worse and wants more funding for debt advice and financial education .
at the mid-sussex debt advice centre which serves the haywards heath area , the average debt of clients - excluding mortgages - is £ 20,000 , rising to £ 110,000 in the most extreme case .
senior debt adviser emma russell said : " we 've seen probably almost a 100 % increase in clients .
this time last year we were really quite quiet . "
and she added : " i 've had at least two clients sit in front of me and tell me they would have killed themselves if they had n't found out we were here . "
debt advisers say financial institutions must take some responsibility for encouraging debt and the government should do more to educate people about financial responsibility .
but they also say a large part of the blame also rests with the individuals who have borrowed so much .

in haywards heath in sussex and congleton in cheshire , for example , there had been a 100 % rise in inquiries over the past year .
it said some advice centres were so busy they had been turning people away .

the local tourist department is looking into setting up a town trail through the seaside resort based on the series about a barry girl and an essex boy .
fans of the show regularly ring up the vale of glamorgan council 's tourist office to ask ' what 's occurring ? ' and find out about the town and the show .
as a result it has contacted the show 's producers about setting up a trail .
since launching on bbc3 last year the romantic comedy , which stars actor matthew horne as gavin and joanna page as stacey , has won rave reviews , a cult audience across the uk as well as winning two baftas .
this interest has now transferred to the town and has already resulted in a mini-tourist boom with the tourist trade on may bank holiday in the town up by an estimated 25 % on last year .
many of the new visitors to the town came from east london and beyond showing that the council could be onto something with its plans . "
some of the callers even ask us if we can tell them what happened on the fishing trip " vale of glamorgan council tourism and marketing manager claire evans vale of glamorgan council tourism and marketing manager claire evans said : " it 's very much in the early stages but we would like to have a trail because there 's so much interest in the town because of gavin and stacey .
" it would be a first for this area and if we do get the go ahead it would be very positive for the area .
" we 've actually had members of the public locally and from essex and all over the uk ringing up and asking about gavin and stacey and where it 's filmed in barry .
" we 're actually having people phoning up to ask ' what 's occurring ? ' like nessa and some of them even try it in her accent as well .
" some of the callers even ask us if we can tell them what happened on the fishing trip .
" but mostly people just want to ring up and find out where to take photos of where the series has been filmed .
" obviously , if something is set up it would have to be done sensitively with everyone 's permission as a lot of the filming was done on private property and we 'd have to sort that side of things out first of all . "
talk plan the council plans to meet up and talk to the production company behind the show , baby cow , about putting together a trail around the town based on the show 's filming locations .
part of the trail could include trinity street , where the gavin and stacey live or the colcot arms pub where the characters are often filmed having a drink and could even stretch as far as dinas powys which doubles as essex in the show .
the landlord of the colcot arms , steve summerhayes , is all for the idea and said everyone in the town already knows that his pub is where the series is filmed .
" everyone who drinks here though knows all about it , " he said .
" but we do get quite a few people coming in for a drink and then when they come up to the bar asking whether this is the place where they did all the filming for the show .
" we 'd welcome the idea of a trail as at the end of the day it 's all good for business .
" we 've been thinking about doing something similar ourselves and even talked about putting something together ourselves . "
the idea has even been taken on board by councillors who are set to discuss the idea later this month at an official meeting .
councillor rob curtis recently said he would be raising the possibility of a trail when the council 's scrutiny committees meet in the near future .

the local tourist department is looking into setting up a town trail through the seaside resort based on the series about a barry girl and an essex boy .
fans of the show regularly ring up the vale of glamorgan council 's tourist office to ask ' what 's occurring ? ' and find out about the town and the show .
as a result it has contacted the show 's producers about setting up a trail .
since launching on bbc3 last year the romantic comedy , which stars actor matthew horne as gavin and joanna page as stacey , has won rave reviews , a cult audience across the uk as well as winning two baftas .
this interest has now transferred to the town and has already resulted in a mini-tourist boom with the tourist trade on may bank holiday in the town up by an estimated 25 % on last year .
many of the new visitors to the town came from east london and beyond showing that the council could be onto something with its plans .
some of the callers even ask us if we can tell them what happened on the fishing trip vale of glamorgan council tourism and marketing manager claire evans vale of glamorgan council tourism and marketing manager claire evans said : " it 's very much in the early stages but we would like to have a trail because there 's so much interest in the town because of gavin and stacey .
" it would be a first for this area and if we do get the go ahead it would be very positive for the area .
" we 've actually had members of the public locally and from essex and all over the uk ringing up and asking about gavin and stacey and where it 's filmed in barry .
" we 're actually having people phoning up to ask ' what 's occurring ? ' like nessa and some of them even try it in her accent as well .
" some of the callers even ask us if we can tell them what happened on the fishing trip .
" but mostly people just want to ring up and find out where to take photos of where the series has been filmed .
" obviously , if something is set up it would have to be done sensitively with everyone 's permission as a lot of the filming was done on private property and we 'd have to sort that side of things out first of all . "
talk plan the council plans to meet up and talk to the production company behind the show , baby cow , about putting together a trail around the town based on the show 's filming locations .
part of the trail could include trinity street , where the gavin and stacey live or the colcot arms pub where the characters are often filmed having a drink and could even stretch as far as dinas powys which doubles as essex in the show .
the landlord of the colcot arms , steve summerhayes , is all for the idea and said everyone in the town already knows that his pub is where the series is filmed .
" everyone who drinks here though knows all about it , " he said .
" but we do get quite a few people coming in for a drink and then when they come up to the bar asking whether this is the place where they did all the filming for the show .
" we 'd welcome the idea of a trail as at the end of the day it 's all good for business .
" we 've been thinking about doing something similar ourselves and even talked about putting something together ourselves . "
the idea has even been taken on board by councillors who are set to discuss the idea later this month at an official meeting .
councillor rob curtis recently said he would be raising the possibility of a trail when the council 's scrutiny committees meet in the near future .
