but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .

one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .

solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .

the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .
if they fall below their allocation , by using a modern fleet of aircraft , for example , they can sell off their unused emissions . airlines who emit more than allowed will be required to buy more emissions rights permits . it forces airlines to cut carbon dioxide emissions by three percent in the first year and by five percent from 2031 onwards .
all air carriers flying into the eu , including non-european airlines , would be included in the program . peter liese , the parliament 's rapporteur on emissions , called the move " revolutionary . " experts expect the measures , which are designed to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming , will lead to an increase in fares . unhappy airlines airlines howled in protest , saying the plan would distort competition and cost them hundreds of millions a year . " from our perspective , the emissions trading scheme is ecologically counter-productive and economically harmful , " a spokesman from german airline lufthansa told reuters news agency . while the european commission has said the deal will add between two and nine euros to the price of a return flight in the eu , budget airline ryanair said the plan could make a ticket 50 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- more expensive . " when airlines like ryanair have invested heavily in new aircraft to reduce our emissions per passenger by 50 percent , there is no justification for this tax theft , " said ryanair ceo michael o 'leary . revenues toward climate change fight under the plan , 85 percent of the emissions certificates are to be allocated for free according to a common european benchmark .
the remainder will be auctioned . revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances will be used to fund efforts to combat climate change , research on clean aircraft , anti-deforestation measures in the developing world and low-emission transport such as trains or buses . airlines with fuel-efficient planes will benefit from the new measures , said liese , while those with older fleets of environmentally unfriendly aircraft will pay more . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions . " but the presence of big developing countries also highlighted differences between them and g8 members on the best way to tackle emissions reduction .
both recognized that " deep cuts " were needed in order to combat climate change , they failed to agree on setting specific targets , saying only that the reduction in greenhouse gases should take place according to the means of each country . and no mention of the g8 's " 50 by 50 " target was made in the joint statement with developing countries , evidence that big polluters such as china and india were not yet willing to commit themselves to internationally agreed cuts . the discussion on global warming now moves on to poznan , poland , where world leaders will take part in december in a conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of a decisive summit in copenhagen next year . japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said that resolving the differences between the european union , which had pushed for heavy cuts , and the united states , which resisted them , the g8 had " contributed to building momentum for the un negotiations . " africa aid in japan , g8 leaders had also come under intense pressure to stick to their pledge to increase aid to africa and help meet the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
these include halving global hunger and getting every child into primary school by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged more money for aid to africa g8 leaders set a five-year deadline to commit $ 60 billion in funding to help the continent fight disease . while they also reaffirmed their wish to increase , by 2010 , annual aid to africa by $ 25 billion , pressure groups complained that the leaders had failed to spell out exactly how such commitments would be met . " the outcome of the g8 summit is nothing but an exercise in escapism .
it is non-committal on major issues confronting the majority of the world 's poor people , " said actionaid , a pressure group . oxfam international said it hoped key decisions would now be made at a special food crisis summit held by the un in new york in september . oil and food the poor state of the global economy also featured high on the g8 agenda , with leaders warning that spiralling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is " seriously concerned " about rising food prices " we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement . they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
they called for an increase in oil production and refining capacities and for the building of more nuclear power plants . g8 leaders also expressed " serious concern " about the surge in food prices , saying they had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . " the asked nations with sufficient food stocks to release some of them to help others cope with soaring prices . zimbabwe g8 leaders also urged iran to stop its nuclear program and issued a statement voicing " grave concern " about the violence-marred re-election in zimbabwe last month of robert mugabe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president robert mugabe casting his vote in harare the summit " made it clear we would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime that has blood on its hands , " british prime minister gordon brown said , rallying world support for un sanctions on harare . however , due to russian opposition , it was not entirely clear whether the g8 had reached a consensus on the imposition of any new sanctions . fukuda said the matter would be referred to the un security council in new york . " -lrb- we had -rrb- a lot of meetings on important subjects , and we accomplished a lot , " said george w. bush , who was attending his final g8 as president of the united states . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia .
they account for two-thirds of the world 's gross domestic product . but as the summit closed wednesday , german chancellor angela merkel said : " the g8 is no longer enough to solve many of the problems .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .

" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .

" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .
negotiations - or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean opposition supporters are calling on the west for help instead of sanctions , russia has promoted negotiations as means of solving the crisis in zimbabwe - a course of action also favored by the african union .
one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .
but a statement issued by tsvangarai 's movement for democratic change party dismissed that report , calling it " a figment of the dictatorship 's imagination . "
it also said the mdc had no plans to negotiate with mugabe . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions . " but the presence of big developing countries also highlighted differences between them and g8 members on the best way to tackle emissions reduction .
both recognized that " deep cuts " were needed in order to combat climate change , they failed to agree on setting specific targets , saying only that the reduction in greenhouse gases should take place according to the means of each country . and no mention of the g8 's " 50 by 50 " target was made in the joint statement with developing countries , evidence that big polluters such as china and india were not yet willing to commit themselves to internationally agreed cuts . the discussion on global warming now moves on to poznan , poland , where world leaders will take part in december in a conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of a decisive summit in copenhagen next year . japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said that resolving the differences between the european union , which had pushed for heavy cuts , and the united states , which resisted them , the g8 had " contributed to building momentum for the un negotiations . " africa aid in japan , g8 leaders had also come under intense pressure to stick to their pledge to increase aid to africa and help meet the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
these include halving global hunger and getting every child into primary school by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged more money for aid to africa g8 leaders set a five-year deadline to commit $ 60 billion in funding to help the continent fight disease . while they also reaffirmed their wish to increase , by 2010 , annual aid to africa by $ 25 billion , pressure groups complained that the leaders had failed to spell out exactly how such commitments would be met . " the outcome of the g8 summit is nothing but an exercise in escapism .
it is non-committal on major issues confronting the majority of the world 's poor people , " said actionaid , a pressure group . oxfam international said it hoped key decisions would now be made at a special food crisis summit held by the un in new york in september . oil and food the poor state of the global economy also featured high on the g8 agenda , with leaders warning that spiralling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is " seriously concerned " about rising food prices " we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement . they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
they called for an increase in oil production and refining capacities and for the building of more nuclear power plants . g8 leaders also expressed " serious concern " about the surge in food prices , saying they had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . " the asked nations with sufficient food stocks to release some of them to help others cope with soaring prices . zimbabwe g8 leaders also urged iran to stop its nuclear program and issued a statement voicing " grave concern " about the violence-marred re-election in zimbabwe last month of robert mugabe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president robert mugabe casting his vote in harare the summit " made it clear we would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime that has blood on its hands , " british prime minister gordon brown said , rallying world support for un sanctions on harare . however , due to russian opposition , it was not entirely clear whether the g8 had reached a consensus on the imposition of any new sanctions . fukuda said the matter would be referred to the un security council in new york . " -lrb- we had -rrb- a lot of meetings on important subjects , and we accomplished a lot , " said george w. bush , who was attending his final g8 as president of the united states . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia .
they account for two-thirds of the world 's gross domestic product . but as the summit closed wednesday , german chancellor angela merkel said : " the g8 is no longer enough to solve many of the problems .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .
if they fall below their allocation , by using a modern fleet of aircraft , for example , they can sell off their unused emissions . airlines who emit more than allowed will be required to buy more emissions rights permits . it forces airlines to cut carbon dioxide emissions by three percent in the first year and by five percent from 2031 onwards .
all air carriers flying into the eu , including non-european airlines , would be included in the program . peter liese , the parliament 's rapporteur on emissions , called the move " revolutionary . " experts expect the measures , which are designed to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming , will lead to an increase in fares . unhappy airlines airlines howled in protest , saying the plan would distort competition and cost them hundreds of millions a year . " from our perspective , the emissions trading scheme is ecologically counter-productive and economically harmful , " a spokesman from german airline lufthansa told reuters news agency . while the european commission has said the deal will add between two and nine euros to the price of a return flight in the eu , budget airline ryanair said the plan could make a ticket 50 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- more expensive . " when airlines like ryanair have invested heavily in new aircraft to reduce our emissions per passenger by 50 percent , there is no justification for this tax theft , " said ryanair ceo michael o 'leary . revenues toward climate change fight under the plan , 85 percent of the emissions certificates are to be allocated for free according to a common european benchmark .
the remainder will be auctioned . revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances will be used to fund efforts to combat climate change , research on clean aircraft , anti-deforestation measures in the developing world and low-emission transport such as trains or buses . airlines with fuel-efficient planes will benefit from the new measures , said liese , while those with older fleets of environmentally unfriendly aircraft will pay more . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but taking up those invitations would mean missing the start of the season - and angering their bosses . it 's a problem that crops up every four years .
olympic invitations are especially welcome to star footballers , such as bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego , who 've had trouble establishing themselves as regulars in their national sides .
" i am pleased and delighted to be called for a major competition and traditional -lsb- sic -rsb- as the olympic games , even more than the fact that i will play for brazil which is in search of an unprecedented achievement , " announced the gifted midfielder in rather garbled translation on his website , after learning of his nomination by brazil coach carlos dunga .
but the olympic soccer competition , which runs from august 7-23 , coincides with the first weeks of the 2008-9 bundesliga season .
and bremen 's sport director klaus allofs is not amused .
" what needs to be said , we 'll say to diego face-to-face , " said allofs in a terse statement to the daily bild newspaper .
bremen is n't the only team with a star player caught between club and country .
rafinha , who plays for bremen 's opponents in the second week of the season , schalke , has also been nominated for brazil .

because the olympics - never known as a major football competition - are not part of the official calendar of the sport 's governing body , fifa , clubs are under no obligation to give their players time off to compete in them .
barcelona , for instance , has already said it will not allow star playmaker ronaldinho to go to beijing .
but the situation is different for under-21 players .
fifa 's rules there have sometimes been interpreted as meaning that clubs must allow them to compete for their national sides .
that 's put hertha berlin at odds with promising young midfielder , gojko kacar , who 's received a call-up form serbia .
kacar says he would like to play in beijing , while hertha desperately want to have him in the german capital to start the season .
the two parties have yet to reach agreement .

hertha , for instance , have given solomon okoronko the green light to play for nigeria , perhaps hoping that the reserve striker will increase his market value with a good performance in beijing .
bayern munich have also signaled no objection to letting 18-year-old defensive talent breno , more of a project for the future than candidate for this season 's starting eleven , join the selecao light in china .

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .
" our diplomacy is based on negotiations . "
iran 's fars news agency reported that the talks would start on july 19 , without citing a source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been chosen as an envoy to iran yet european leaders seemed to be hedging their bets this week .
iran has made no promise that it will suspend nuclear enrichment , which was the basis for any negotiations .
" the fact that there is no mention of suspending sensitive activities is clearly an issue , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier said in paris .
the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .
war of words continues iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has repeatedly insisted that iran will not give up its right to a nuclear program .
" no one in iran will go back from our nuclear position , " ahmadinejad said tuesday .
" we want dialogue for the benefit of all sides but within the framework of law and justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is under sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment he also promised swift retaliation in the case that the us or israel were to attack iran in an attempt to stop its nuclear program .
an aide to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei added that iran would not hesitate to " set fire " to israel and the us navy in the gulf if attacked .
" the first us shot on iran would set the united states ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said ali shirazi , a mid-ranking cleric who is khamenei 's representative to the naval forces of the elite revolutionary guards .
" tel aviv and the us fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in iran 's crushing response , " he said , according to the fars news agency .

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .
" our diplomacy is based on negotiations . "
iran 's fars news agency reported that the talks would start on july 19 , without citing a source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been chosen as an envoy to iran yet european leaders seemed to be hedging their bets this week .
iran has made no promise that it will suspend nuclear enrichment , which was the basis for any negotiations .
" the fact that there is no mention of suspending sensitive activities is clearly an issue , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier said in paris .
the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .
war of words continues iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has repeatedly insisted that iran will not give up its right to a nuclear program .
" no one in iran will go back from our nuclear position , " ahmadinejad said tuesday .
" we want dialogue for the benefit of all sides but within the framework of law and justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is under sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment he also promised swift retaliation in the case that the us or israel were to attack iran in an attempt to stop its nuclear program .

" the first us shot on iran would set the united states ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said ali shirazi , a mid-ranking cleric who is khamenei 's representative to the naval forces of the elite revolutionary guards .

but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .

fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .

obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .
but a statement issued by tsvangarai 's movement for democratic change party dismissed that report , calling it " a figment of the dictatorship 's imagination . "

" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .

" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .
if they fall below their allocation , by using a modern fleet of aircraft , for example , they can sell off their unused emissions . airlines who emit more than allowed will be required to buy more emissions rights permits . it forces airlines to cut carbon dioxide emissions by three percent in the first year and by five percent from 2031 onwards .
all air carriers flying into the eu , including non-european airlines , would be included in the program . peter liese , the parliament 's rapporteur on emissions , called the move " revolutionary .

" from our perspective , the emissions trading scheme is ecologically counter-productive and economically harmful , " a spokesman from german airline lufthansa told reuters news agency . while the european commission has said the deal will add between two and nine euros to the price of a return flight in the eu , budget airline ryanair said the plan could make a ticket 50 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- more expensive . " when airlines like ryanair have invested heavily in new aircraft to reduce our emissions per passenger by 50 percent , there is no justification for this tax theft , " said ryanair ceo michael o 'leary . revenues toward climate change fight under the plan , 85 percent of the emissions certificates are to be allocated for free according to a common european benchmark .
the remainder will be auctioned . revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances will be used to fund efforts to combat climate change , research on clean aircraft , anti-deforestation measures in the developing world and low-emission transport such as trains or buses . airlines with fuel-efficient planes will benefit from the new measures , said liese , while those with older fleets of environmentally unfriendly aircraft will pay more . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

the case has led to a debate over the legality of deporting german-born immigrants who commit crimes . even as the two young men 's sentences were being announced on tuesday , july 8 , top german politicians such as bavaria 's premier guenther beckstein were calling for both of them to be deported .
anyone who attacks someone else without provocation and kicks their head as if it were a football has no place in germany , beckstein said .
" first jail , then deportation ! "
germany 's largest tabloid bild proclaimed .
unwanted criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attackers are from immigrant backgrounds two young men , who grew up in germany , brutally beat an elderly man a few days before christmas last year .
the men admitted to the attack , saying they were angry after the retired teacher yelled at them for smoking in the subway .
a munich court handed down harsh sentences .
serkan a. , 21 , whose family comes from turkey , will spend the next 12 years in prison .
spyridon l. , of greek origin , was sentenced to 8.5 years of detention in a juvenile facility as he was 17 when the attack occurred .
the case was taken up as a political cause by some conservatives , who blamed young foreigners for increasing crime rates .
hans peter uhl , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and an expert on legal and interior ministry affairs agrees .
he said that the department responsible for foreigners should use the time while the men are incarcerated to prepare the legal case to have them deported .
not an open and closed case however , criminologist christian pfeiffer said that expelling the two men from the country could prove problematic .
when it comes to deportation , there needs to be a long debate , particularly in this case where the men have spent nearly all of their lives in germany , pfeiffer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men call southern germany home someone born here to immigrant parents is " made in germany " in the sense that he was raised in this society and his social contacts are here , pfeiffer said .
in past cases , courts have rejected deportation procedures against german-born foreigners .
munich city administrator wilfried blume-beyerle also said the situation needs to be examined before any action is taken .
it appears that serkan a. was born in germany and spyridon l. , since he is from greece , is a resident of the european union , blume-beyerle said .
the government must provide extremely good reasons to win a deportation order and in the case of spyridon l. , must also show that he is likely to re-offend .
men seen posing a danger bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann does n't believe that it will be difficult to deport the men .
the interior ministry will push for the corresponding deportation procedures to begin , he said .
" after the sentences are served , we must naturally do everything possible to ensure that these culprits leave our country . "
herrmann noted that the court handed down an extremely strong sentence for both the men .
this is a clear signal that the men pose a danger and that deportation is in order , herrmann said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a dispute over its name kept macedonia from meeting its nato accession goal this time around . the signing was conducted during a ceremony at the alliance 's headquarters in brussels on wednesday , july 9 .
it was largely a formality since nato had agreed to bring the two balkan countries into the fold at a summit in bucharest in april . " this is a historical achievement , not just for these two countries but for the entire atlantic community of nations , " said nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer .
" albania and croatia have implemented major political and military reforms and therefore earned their rightful place at our table . " the protocols , signed by the ambassadors of the nato member states in the presence of the albanian and croatian foreign ministers , alter the north atlantic treaty - nato 's founding document - to add the two adriatic states ' names to the list of members . nato accession is " the fulfilment of the paramount ambition of the albanian people , " and the ceremony " marks the crowning of our long and determined efforts , " albanian foreign minister lulzim basha said . " this is a historical moment for croatia : joining the alliance represents one of the most important moments in our history , " croatian foreign minister gordan jandrokovic said .
" this is the final chapter of a long process for croatia and albania ... a unique privilege for our generation . " however , one other country wishing to join the club , macedonia , was not at the ceremony since its accession was blocked by greece due to a long-running dispute over its name . ratification process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer nato 's current members will now have to ratify the protocols in their national parliaments .
once they have done so , albania and croatia will have to ratify the modified version of the treaty , becoming full members as soon as they lodge the ratification documents in washington . nato leaders invited the two adriatic states to join their alliance at a summit in bucharest in april . officials say that once the accession protocols have been signed , the ratification process usually takes approximately one year .
during that period , the soon-to-be members have the right to take part in most nato meetings , but they do not sit in alphabetical order among the current members and they have no role in decision making . however , nato leaders have indicated that they hope the process can be completed in time for the alliance 's 60th anniversary in april 2009 .
the anniversary is set to be marked by a summit in the french town of strasbourg and its german neighbor , kehl . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but taking up those invitations would mean missing the start of the season - and angering their bosses . it 's a problem that crops up every four years .
olympic invitations are especially welcome to star footballers , such as bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego , who 've had trouble establishing themselves as regulars in their national sides .
" i am pleased and delighted to be called for a major competition and traditional -lsb- sic -rsb- as the olympic games , even more than the fact that i will play for brazil which is in search of an unprecedented achievement , " announced the gifted midfielder in rather garbled translation on his website , after learning of his nomination by brazil coach carlos dunga .
but the olympic soccer competition , which runs from august 7-23 , coincides with the first weeks of the 2008-9 bundesliga season .
and bremen 's sport director klaus allofs is not amused .
" what needs to be said , we 'll say to diego face-to-face , " said allofs in a terse statement to the daily bild newspaper .
bremen is n't the only team with a star player caught between club and country .

barcelona , for instance , has already said it will not allow star playmaker ronaldinho to go to beijing .
but the situation is different for under-21 players .
fifa 's rules there have sometimes been interpreted as meaning that clubs must allow them to compete for their national sides .
that 's put hertha berlin at odds with promising young midfielder , gojko kacar , who 's received a call-up form serbia .
kacar says he would like to play in beijing , while hertha desperately want to have him in the german capital to start the season .
the two parties have yet to reach agreement .
display window bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics can be a valuable learning experience for youngsters like breno clubs do n't have any objections , on the other hand , to non-regulars living out their olympic dreams .
hertha , for instance , have given solomon okoronko the green light to play for nigeria , perhaps hoping that the reserve striker will increase his market value with a good performance in beijing .
bayern munich have also signaled no objection to letting 18-year-old defensive talent breno , more of a project for the future than candidate for this season 's starting eleven , join the selecao light in china .

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .
if they fall below their allocation , by using a modern fleet of aircraft , for example , they can sell off their unused emissions . airlines who emit more than allowed will be required to buy more emissions rights permits . it forces airlines to cut carbon dioxide emissions by three percent in the first year and by five percent from 2031 onwards .
all air carriers flying into the eu , including non-european airlines , would be included in the program . peter liese , the parliament 's rapporteur on emissions , called the move " revolutionary . " experts expect the measures , which are designed to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming , will lead to an increase in fares . unhappy airlines airlines howled in protest , saying the plan would distort competition and cost them hundreds of millions a year . " from our perspective , the emissions trading scheme is ecologically counter-productive and economically harmful , " a spokesman from german airline lufthansa told reuters news agency . while the european commission has said the deal will add between two and nine euros to the price of a return flight in the eu , budget airline ryanair said the plan could make a ticket 50 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- more expensive . " when airlines like ryanair have invested heavily in new aircraft to reduce our emissions per passenger by 50 percent , there is no justification for this tax theft , " said ryanair ceo michael o 'leary . revenues toward climate change fight under the plan , 85 percent of the emissions certificates are to be allocated for free according to a common european benchmark .
the remainder will be auctioned . revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances will be used to fund efforts to combat climate change , research on clean aircraft , anti-deforestation measures in the developing world and low-emission transport such as trains or buses . airlines with fuel-efficient planes will benefit from the new measures , said liese , while those with older fleets of environmentally unfriendly aircraft will pay more . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .
negotiations - or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean opposition supporters are calling on the west for help instead of sanctions , russia has promoted negotiations as means of solving the crisis in zimbabwe - a course of action also favored by the african union .
one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .
but a statement issued by tsvangarai 's movement for democratic change party dismissed that report , calling it " a figment of the dictatorship 's imagination . "

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .
if they fall below their allocation , by using a modern fleet of aircraft , for example , they can sell off their unused emissions . airlines who emit more than allowed will be required to buy more emissions rights permits . it forces airlines to cut carbon dioxide emissions by three percent in the first year and by five percent from 2031 onwards .
all air carriers flying into the eu , including non-european airlines , would be included in the program . peter liese , the parliament 's rapporteur on emissions , called the move " revolutionary . " experts expect the measures , which are designed to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming , will lead to an increase in fares . unhappy airlines airlines howled in protest , saying the plan would distort competition and cost them hundreds of millions a year . " from our perspective , the emissions trading scheme is ecologically counter-productive and economically harmful , " a spokesman from german airline lufthansa told reuters news agency . while the european commission has said the deal will add between two and nine euros to the price of a return flight in the eu , budget airline ryanair said the plan could make a ticket 50 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- more expensive . " when airlines like ryanair have invested heavily in new aircraft to reduce our emissions per passenger by 50 percent , there is no justification for this tax theft , " said ryanair ceo michael o 'leary . revenues toward climate change fight under the plan , 85 percent of the emissions certificates are to be allocated for free according to a common european benchmark .
the remainder will be auctioned . revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances will be used to fund efforts to combat climate change , research on clean aircraft , anti-deforestation measures in the developing world and low-emission transport such as trains or buses . airlines with fuel-efficient planes will benefit from the new measures , said liese , while those with older fleets of environmentally unfriendly aircraft will pay more . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin united states -pipe- 09.07.2008 opinion : europeans should prepare for obama disappointment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans welcomed the news that the democratic presidential hopeful would visit berlin and other major european cities this month .
but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .
if they fall below their allocation , by using a modern fleet of aircraft , for example , they can sell off their unused emissions . airlines who emit more than allowed will be required to buy more emissions rights permits . it forces airlines to cut carbon dioxide emissions by three percent in the first year and by five percent from 2031 onwards .
all air carriers flying into the eu , including non-european airlines , would be included in the program . peter liese , the parliament 's rapporteur on emissions , called the move " revolutionary . " experts expect the measures , which are designed to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming , will lead to an increase in fares . unhappy airlines airlines howled in protest , saying the plan would distort competition and cost them hundreds of millions a year . " from our perspective , the emissions trading scheme is ecologically counter-productive and economically harmful , " a spokesman from german airline lufthansa told reuters news agency . while the european commission has said the deal will add between two and nine euros to the price of a return flight in the eu , budget airline ryanair said the plan could make a ticket 50 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- more expensive . " when airlines like ryanair have invested heavily in new aircraft to reduce our emissions per passenger by 50 percent , there is no justification for this tax theft , " said ryanair ceo michael o 'leary . revenues toward climate change fight under the plan , 85 percent of the emissions certificates are to be allocated for free according to a common european benchmark .
the remainder will be auctioned . revenues generated from the auctioning of emissions allowances will be used to fund efforts to combat climate change , research on clean aircraft , anti-deforestation measures in the developing world and low-emission transport such as trains or buses . airlines with fuel-efficient planes will benefit from the new measures , said liese , while those with older fleets of environmentally unfriendly aircraft will pay more . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .

" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin united states -pipe- 09.07.2008 opinion : europeans should prepare for obama disappointment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans welcomed the news that the democratic presidential hopeful would visit berlin and other major european cities this month .
but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin united states -pipe- 09.07.2008 opinion : europeans should prepare for obama disappointment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans welcomed the news that the democratic presidential hopeful would visit berlin and other major european cities this month .
but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" from our perspective , the emissions trading scheme is ecologically counter-productive and economically harmful , " a spokesman from german airline lufthansa told reuters news agency . while the european commission has said the deal will add between two and nine euros to the price of a return flight in the eu , budget airline ryanair said the plan could make a ticket 50 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- more expensive .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .
negotiations - or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean opposition supporters are calling on the west for help instead of sanctions , russia has promoted negotiations as means of solving the crisis in zimbabwe - a course of action also favored by the african union .
one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .
but a statement issued by tsvangarai 's movement for democratic change party dismissed that report , calling it " a figment of the dictatorship 's imagination . "

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .
" our diplomacy is based on negotiations . "
iran 's fars news agency reported that the talks would start on july 19 , without citing a source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been chosen as an envoy to iran yet european leaders seemed to be hedging their bets this week .
iran has made no promise that it will suspend nuclear enrichment , which was the basis for any negotiations .
" the fact that there is no mention of suspending sensitive activities is clearly an issue , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier said in paris .
the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .
war of words continues iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has repeatedly insisted that iran will not give up its right to a nuclear program .
" no one in iran will go back from our nuclear position , " ahmadinejad said tuesday .
" we want dialogue for the benefit of all sides but within the framework of law and justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is under sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment he also promised swift retaliation in the case that the us or israel were to attack iran in an attempt to stop its nuclear program .
an aide to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei added that iran would not hesitate to " set fire " to israel and the us navy in the gulf if attacked .
" the first us shot on iran would set the united states ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said ali shirazi , a mid-ranking cleric who is khamenei 's representative to the naval forces of the elite revolutionary guards .
" tel aviv and the us fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in iran 's crushing response , " he said , according to the fars news agency .

but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three of the passengers got out of the car and fired at police starting a firefight that lasted between seven and eight minutes .
istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters at the scene that three attackers and one police officer were declared dead at the scene and that two police officers were later pronounced dead at a local hospital .
guler said that two police officers were wounded in the attack and were being treated for non life-threatening injuries at a local hospital .
the driver of the car reportedly fled the scene sparking a large- scale police search .
authorities label attack a " terrorist " event istanbul chief prosecutor aykut cengiz engin touring the scene said that the attackers armed with handguns and pump-action shotguns were aged between 25 and 30 and that investigators were seeking to find whether the gunmen had any links to any known terrorist groups .
" we are treating this as a terrorist attack , " engin said at the scene .
us ambassador to turkey ross wilson told reporters in ankara that all us personnel at the consulate were safe and accounted and expressed his country 's sadness for the loss of turkish lives .
he said the embassy had not received any threats in recent days and that u.s. security officials were cooperating with turkish police to solve what he described as a " dastardly and cowardly act " .
" it is inappropriate now to speculate who was responsible for this or what why they carried out this action .
it is an obvious act of terrorism .
our countries will stand together to confront this as we have confronted similar problems in the past , " wilson said .
wilson also said that he had asked for extra security at us consulates and at the embassy in ankara .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice , on a visit to tbilisi , voiced " deep regret " at the loss of life and highlighted the " very rapid and proper response " by turkish officials .
turkish interior minister besir atalay said no one had yet claimed responsibility for the incident .
first foreign attack since deadly 2003 bombing the consulate was moved to its current high-security location in 2003 as foreign missions across the world stepped up security measures following the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york .
the most recent attack on a foreign mission in turkey was in 2003 when al qaeda militants detonated a car bomb at the british consulate in central istanbul , and simultaneously attacked the british hsbc bank .

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .

it was the 26-year-old rider 's first tour stage victory . schumacher led the pack in an individual time trial in and around the western city of cholet on tuesday , taking the race leader 's yellow jersey .
the previous holder , frenchman romain feillu , lagged in 169th place .
schumacher 's time for the 29.5-kilometer -lrb- 18.3-mile -rrb- course was 35 minutes 44 seconds , with an average speed of 49.5 kph -lrb- 30.8 mph -rrb- .
luxembourg 's kim kirchen finished 18 seconds behind schumacher , with david millar of britain in third .
schumacher now leads kirchen in the standings by 12 seconds , with millar in third , also 12 seconds behind .
" this is extraordinary , " a delighted schumacher told french television .
" the course was perfect for me , because it had climbs and descents .
it 's great to be on the podium in the tour de france . "
drug questions follow him schumacher 's future in cycling was in doubt late last year when police found traces of amphetamine in his blood after a minor traffic accident .
schumacher said at the time that he did n't have the slightest idea how the drug came into his body .
german cycling officials said that since the drug was not detected in an official test , he would not be suspended .
race remains tight australian cadel evans finished fourth on tuesday , 27 seconds behind the winner .
but he gained valuable time on his rivals for the title , especially spaniard alejandro valverde , who finished 23rd , 1 minute and 34 seconds behind the winner .
valverde now stands 17th , 1 minute and 27 seconds behind schumacher and 1 minute and 6 seconds behind evans .
wednesday 's fifth stage takes the tour into the foothills of the massif central .

merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .

a dispute over its name kept macedonia from meeting its nato accession goal this time around . the signing was conducted during a ceremony at the alliance 's headquarters in brussels on wednesday , july 9 .
it was largely a formality since nato had agreed to bring the two balkan countries into the fold at a summit in bucharest in april . " this is a historical achievement , not just for these two countries but for the entire atlantic community of nations , " said nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer .
" albania and croatia have implemented major political and military reforms and therefore earned their rightful place at our table . " the protocols , signed by the ambassadors of the nato member states in the presence of the albanian and croatian foreign ministers , alter the north atlantic treaty - nato 's founding document - to add the two adriatic states ' names to the list of members . nato accession is " the fulfilment of the paramount ambition of the albanian people , " and the ceremony " marks the crowning of our long and determined efforts , " albanian foreign minister lulzim basha said . " this is a historical moment for croatia : joining the alliance represents one of the most important moments in our history , " croatian foreign minister gordan jandrokovic said .
" this is the final chapter of a long process for croatia and albania ... a unique privilege for our generation . " however , one other country wishing to join the club , macedonia , was not at the ceremony since its accession was blocked by greece due to a long-running dispute over its name . ratification process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer nato 's current members will now have to ratify the protocols in their national parliaments .

a dispute over its name kept macedonia from meeting its nato accession goal this time around . the signing was conducted during a ceremony at the alliance 's headquarters in brussels on wednesday , july 9 .
it was largely a formality since nato had agreed to bring the two balkan countries into the fold at a summit in bucharest in april . " this is a historical achievement , not just for these two countries but for the entire atlantic community of nations , " said nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer .
" albania and croatia have implemented major political and military reforms and therefore earned their rightful place at our table . " the protocols , signed by the ambassadors of the nato member states in the presence of the albanian and croatian foreign ministers , alter the north atlantic treaty - nato 's founding document - to add the two adriatic states ' names to the list of members . nato accession is " the fulfilment of the paramount ambition of the albanian people , " and the ceremony " marks the crowning of our long and determined efforts , " albanian foreign minister lulzim basha said . " this is a historical moment for croatia : joining the alliance represents one of the most important moments in our history , " croatian foreign minister gordan jandrokovic said .
" this is the final chapter of a long process for croatia and albania ... a unique privilege for our generation .

france currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu . the french president apparently told his chinese counterpart hu jintao about his decision during their meeting wednesday in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , where leaders from the group of eight countries are discussing global issues . sarkozy had earlier suggested he might boycott the august 8 olympic opening ceremony in beijing and urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama . media watchdog group reporters without borders has slammed sarkozy 's change of mind . " this is surrender in the middle of battle , an abandonment of all the commitments he made as a candidate and all the values our country embodies , " the group 's secretary-general robert menard said . warning from china sarkozy 's decision follows a harsh warning from china 's ambassador to france on tuesday , who said there would be " serious consequences " for sino-french relations if sarkozy met with the dalai lama .
the tibetan spiritual leader is planning a visit to france next month . sarkozy has left open the possibility of a meeting with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , but any potential meeting has been sharply criticized by kong quan , beijing 's ambassador in paris , as interference in internal affairs . " the dalai lama is not only a spiritual leader but also and above all someone who has separatist activities and who leads a government in exile , " he told reporters in paris on tuesday , june 8 . the dalai lama is scheduled to visit france from august 12 to 23 during which he will attend a conference on buddhism in the western city of nantes . relations between paris and beijing have been under strain for months after a chaotic olympic torch relay through the streets of the french capital that was disrupted by protestors angry at beijing 's crackdown in tibet . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the previous holder , frenchman romain feillu , lagged in 169th place .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .
negotiations - or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean opposition supporters are calling on the west for help instead of sanctions , russia has promoted negotiations as means of solving the crisis in zimbabwe - a course of action also favored by the african union .
one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .
but a statement issued by tsvangarai 's movement for democratic change party dismissed that report , calling it " a figment of the dictatorship 's imagination . "

the case has led to a debate over the legality of deporting german-born immigrants who commit crimes . even as the two young men 's sentences were being announced on tuesday , july 8 , top german politicians such as bavaria 's premier guenther beckstein were calling for both of them to be deported .
anyone who attacks someone else without provocation and kicks their head as if it were a football has no place in germany , beckstein said .
" first jail , then deportation ! "
germany 's largest tabloid bild proclaimed .
unwanted criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attackers are from immigrant backgrounds two young men , who grew up in germany , brutally beat an elderly man a few days before christmas last year .
the men admitted to the attack , saying they were angry after the retired teacher yelled at them for smoking in the subway .
a munich court handed down harsh sentences .
serkan a. , 21 , whose family comes from turkey , will spend the next 12 years in prison .
spyridon l. , of greek origin , was sentenced to 8.5 years of detention in a juvenile facility as he was 17 when the attack occurred .
the case was taken up as a political cause by some conservatives , who blamed young foreigners for increasing crime rates .
hans peter uhl , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and an expert on legal and interior ministry affairs agrees .
he said that the department responsible for foreigners should use the time while the men are incarcerated to prepare the legal case to have them deported .
not an open and closed case however , criminologist christian pfeiffer said that expelling the two men from the country could prove problematic .
when it comes to deportation , there needs to be a long debate , particularly in this case where the men have spent nearly all of their lives in germany , pfeiffer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men call southern germany home someone born here to immigrant parents is " made in germany " in the sense that he was raised in this society and his social contacts are here , pfeiffer said .
in past cases , courts have rejected deportation procedures against german-born foreigners .
munich city administrator wilfried blume-beyerle also said the situation needs to be examined before any action is taken .
it appears that serkan a. was born in germany and spyridon l. , since he is from greece , is a resident of the european union , blume-beyerle said .
the government must provide extremely good reasons to win a deportation order and in the case of spyridon l. , must also show that he is likely to re-offend .
men seen posing a danger bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann does n't believe that it will be difficult to deport the men .
the interior ministry will push for the corresponding deportation procedures to begin , he said .
" after the sentences are served , we must naturally do everything possible to ensure that these culprits leave our country . "
herrmann noted that the court handed down an extremely strong sentence for both the men .
this is a clear signal that the men pose a danger and that deportation is in order , herrmann said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .
" our diplomacy is based on negotiations . "
iran 's fars news agency reported that the talks would start on july 19 , without citing a source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been chosen as an envoy to iran yet european leaders seemed to be hedging their bets this week .
iran has made no promise that it will suspend nuclear enrichment , which was the basis for any negotiations .
" the fact that there is no mention of suspending sensitive activities is clearly an issue , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier said in paris .
the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .
war of words continues iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has repeatedly insisted that iran will not give up its right to a nuclear program .
" no one in iran will go back from our nuclear position , " ahmadinejad said tuesday .
" we want dialogue for the benefit of all sides but within the framework of law and justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is under sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment he also promised swift retaliation in the case that the us or israel were to attack iran in an attempt to stop its nuclear program .
an aide to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei added that iran would not hesitate to " set fire " to israel and the us navy in the gulf if attacked .
" the first us shot on iran would set the united states ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said ali shirazi , a mid-ranking cleric who is khamenei 's representative to the naval forces of the elite revolutionary guards .
" tel aviv and the us fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in iran 's crushing response , " he said , according to the fars news agency .

the case has led to a debate over the legality of deporting german-born immigrants who commit crimes . even as the two young men 's sentences were being announced on tuesday , july 8 , top german politicians such as bavaria 's premier guenther beckstein were calling for both of them to be deported .
anyone who attacks someone else without provocation and kicks their head as if it were a football has no place in germany , beckstein said .
" first jail , then deportation ! "
germany 's largest tabloid bild proclaimed .
unwanted criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attackers are from immigrant backgrounds two young men , who grew up in germany , brutally beat an elderly man a few days before christmas last year .
the men admitted to the attack , saying they were angry after the retired teacher yelled at them for smoking in the subway .
a munich court handed down harsh sentences .
serkan a. , 21 , whose family comes from turkey , will spend the next 12 years in prison .
spyridon l. , of greek origin , was sentenced to 8.5 years of detention in a juvenile facility as he was 17 when the attack occurred .
the case was taken up as a political cause by some conservatives , who blamed young foreigners for increasing crime rates .
hans peter uhl , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and an expert on legal and interior ministry affairs agrees .
he said that the department responsible for foreigners should use the time while the men are incarcerated to prepare the legal case to have them deported .
not an open and closed case however , criminologist christian pfeiffer said that expelling the two men from the country could prove problematic .
when it comes to deportation , there needs to be a long debate , particularly in this case where the men have spent nearly all of their lives in germany , pfeiffer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men call southern germany home someone born here to immigrant parents is " made in germany " in the sense that he was raised in this society and his social contacts are here , pfeiffer said .
in past cases , courts have rejected deportation procedures against german-born foreigners .
munich city administrator wilfried blume-beyerle also said the situation needs to be examined before any action is taken .
it appears that serkan a. was born in germany and spyridon l. , since he is from greece , is a resident of the european union , blume-beyerle said .
the government must provide extremely good reasons to win a deportation order and in the case of spyridon l. , must also show that he is likely to re-offend .
men seen posing a danger bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann does n't believe that it will be difficult to deport the men .
the interior ministry will push for the corresponding deportation procedures to begin , he said .
" after the sentences are served , we must naturally do everything possible to ensure that these culprits leave our country . "
herrmann noted that the court handed down an extremely strong sentence for both the men .
this is a clear signal that the men pose a danger and that deportation is in order , herrmann said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture . " " if you are talking about military action , this of course is not the case , " churkin said in new york . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu . the french president apparently told his chinese counterpart hu jintao about his decision during their meeting wednesday in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , where leaders from the group of eight countries are discussing global issues . sarkozy had earlier suggested he might boycott the august 8 olympic opening ceremony in beijing and urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama . media watchdog group reporters without borders has slammed sarkozy 's change of mind . " this is surrender in the middle of battle , an abandonment of all the commitments he made as a candidate and all the values our country embodies , " the group 's secretary-general robert menard said . warning from china sarkozy 's decision follows a harsh warning from china 's ambassador to france on tuesday , who said there would be " serious consequences " for sino-french relations if sarkozy met with the dalai lama .
the tibetan spiritual leader is planning a visit to france next month . sarkozy has left open the possibility of a meeting with the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , but any potential meeting has been sharply criticized by kong quan , beijing 's ambassador in paris , as interference in internal affairs . " the dalai lama is not only a spiritual leader but also and above all someone who has separatist activities and who leads a government in exile , " he told reporters in paris on tuesday , june 8 . the dalai lama is scheduled to visit france from august 12 to 23 during which he will attend a conference on buddhism in the western city of nantes . relations between paris and beijing have been under strain for months after a chaotic olympic torch relay through the streets of the french capital that was disrupted by protestors angry at beijing 's crackdown in tibet . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case has led to a debate over the legality of deporting german-born immigrants who commit crimes . even as the two young men 's sentences were being announced on tuesday , july 8 , top german politicians such as bavaria 's premier guenther beckstein were calling for both of them to be deported .
anyone who attacks someone else without provocation and kicks their head as if it were a football has no place in germany , beckstein said .
" first jail , then deportation ! "
germany 's largest tabloid bild proclaimed .
unwanted criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attackers are from immigrant backgrounds two young men , who grew up in germany , brutally beat an elderly man a few days before christmas last year .
the men admitted to the attack , saying they were angry after the retired teacher yelled at them for smoking in the subway .
a munich court handed down harsh sentences .
serkan a. , 21 , whose family comes from turkey , will spend the next 12 years in prison .
spyridon l. , of greek origin , was sentenced to 8.5 years of detention in a juvenile facility as he was 17 when the attack occurred .
the case was taken up as a political cause by some conservatives , who blamed young foreigners for increasing crime rates .
hans peter uhl , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and an expert on legal and interior ministry affairs agrees .
he said that the department responsible for foreigners should use the time while the men are incarcerated to prepare the legal case to have them deported .
not an open and closed case however , criminologist christian pfeiffer said that expelling the two men from the country could prove problematic .
when it comes to deportation , there needs to be a long debate , particularly in this case where the men have spent nearly all of their lives in germany , pfeiffer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men call southern germany home someone born here to immigrant parents is " made in germany " in the sense that he was raised in this society and his social contacts are here , pfeiffer said .
in past cases , courts have rejected deportation procedures against german-born foreigners .
munich city administrator wilfried blume-beyerle also said the situation needs to be examined before any action is taken .
it appears that serkan a. was born in germany and spyridon l. , since he is from greece , is a resident of the european union , blume-beyerle said .
the government must provide extremely good reasons to win a deportation order and in the case of spyridon l. , must also show that he is likely to re-offend .
men seen posing a danger bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann does n't believe that it will be difficult to deport the men .
the interior ministry will push for the corresponding deportation procedures to begin , he said .
" after the sentences are served , we must naturally do everything possible to ensure that these culprits leave our country . "
herrmann noted that the court handed down an extremely strong sentence for both the men .
this is a clear signal that the men pose a danger and that deportation is in order , herrmann said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions . " but the presence of big developing countries also highlighted differences between them and g8 members on the best way to tackle emissions reduction .
both recognized that " deep cuts " were needed in order to combat climate change , they failed to agree on setting specific targets , saying only that the reduction in greenhouse gases should take place according to the means of each country . and no mention of the g8 's " 50 by 50 " target was made in the joint statement with developing countries , evidence that big polluters such as china and india were not yet willing to commit themselves to internationally agreed cuts . the discussion on global warming now moves on to poznan , poland , where world leaders will take part in december in a conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of a decisive summit in copenhagen next year . japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said that resolving the differences between the european union , which had pushed for heavy cuts , and the united states , which resisted them , the g8 had " contributed to building momentum for the un negotiations . " africa aid in japan , g8 leaders had also come under intense pressure to stick to their pledge to increase aid to africa and help meet the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
these include halving global hunger and getting every child into primary school by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged more money for aid to africa g8 leaders set a five-year deadline to commit $ 60 billion in funding to help the continent fight disease . while they also reaffirmed their wish to increase , by 2010 , annual aid to africa by $ 25 billion , pressure groups complained that the leaders had failed to spell out exactly how such commitments would be met . " the outcome of the g8 summit is nothing but an exercise in escapism .
it is non-committal on major issues confronting the majority of the world 's poor people , " said actionaid , a pressure group . oxfam international said it hoped key decisions would now be made at a special food crisis summit held by the un in new york in september . oil and food the poor state of the global economy also featured high on the g8 agenda , with leaders warning that spiralling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is " seriously concerned " about rising food prices " we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement . they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
they called for an increase in oil production and refining capacities and for the building of more nuclear power plants . g8 leaders also expressed " serious concern " about the surge in food prices , saying they had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . " the asked nations with sufficient food stocks to release some of them to help others cope with soaring prices . zimbabwe g8 leaders also urged iran to stop its nuclear program and issued a statement voicing " grave concern " about the violence-marred re-election in zimbabwe last month of robert mugabe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president robert mugabe casting his vote in harare the summit " made it clear we would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime that has blood on its hands , " british prime minister gordon brown said , rallying world support for un sanctions on harare . however , due to russian opposition , it was not entirely clear whether the g8 had reached a consensus on the imposition of any new sanctions . fukuda said the matter would be referred to the un security council in new york . " -lrb- we had -rrb- a lot of meetings on important subjects , and we accomplished a lot , " said george w. bush , who was attending his final g8 as president of the united states . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia .
they account for two-thirds of the world 's gross domestic product . but as the summit closed wednesday , german chancellor angela merkel said : " the g8 is no longer enough to solve many of the problems .

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .
" our diplomacy is based on negotiations . "
iran 's fars news agency reported that the talks would start on july 19 , without citing a source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been chosen as an envoy to iran yet european leaders seemed to be hedging their bets this week .
iran has made no promise that it will suspend nuclear enrichment , which was the basis for any negotiations .
" the fact that there is no mention of suspending sensitive activities is clearly an issue , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier said in paris .
the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .
war of words continues iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has repeatedly insisted that iran will not give up its right to a nuclear program .
" no one in iran will go back from our nuclear position , " ahmadinejad said tuesday .
" we want dialogue for the benefit of all sides but within the framework of law and justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is under sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment he also promised swift retaliation in the case that the us or israel were to attack iran in an attempt to stop its nuclear program .
an aide to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei added that iran would not hesitate to " set fire " to israel and the us navy in the gulf if attacked .
" the first us shot on iran would set the united states ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said ali shirazi , a mid-ranking cleric who is khamenei 's representative to the naval forces of the elite revolutionary guards .
" tel aviv and the us fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in iran 's crushing response , " he said , according to the fars news agency .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin united states -pipe- 09.07.2008 opinion : europeans should prepare for obama disappointment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans welcomed the news that the democratic presidential hopeful would visit berlin and other major european cities this month .
but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 09.07.2008 olympics creates problems for bundesliga teams , players großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be doing his celebrating in germany in august some bundesliga players have been invited to play for their national teams at the olympic summer games in beijing .
but taking up those invitations would mean missing the start of the season - and angering their bosses . it 's a problem that crops up every four years .
olympic invitations are especially welcome to star footballers , such as bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego , who 've had trouble establishing themselves as regulars in their national sides .
" i am pleased and delighted to be called for a major competition and traditional -lsb- sic -rsb- as the olympic games , even more than the fact that i will play for brazil which is in search of an unprecedented achievement , " announced the gifted midfielder in rather garbled translation on his website , after learning of his nomination by brazil coach carlos dunga .
but the olympic soccer competition , which runs from august 7-23 , coincides with the first weeks of the 2008-9 bundesliga season .
and bremen 's sport director klaus allofs is not amused .
" what needs to be said , we 'll say to diego face-to-face , " said allofs in a terse statement to the daily bild newspaper .
bremen is n't the only team with a star player caught between club and country .
rafinha , who plays for bremen 's opponents in the second week of the season , schalke , has also been nominated for brazil .
driver 's seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafinha , l , says he understands schalke 's position schalke has said they will not release rafinha to play in the summer games , and the defender has accepted that decision - with good reason .
because the olympics - never known as a major football competition - are not part of the official calendar of the sport 's governing body , fifa , clubs are under no obligation to give their players time off to compete in them .
barcelona , for instance , has already said it will not allow star playmaker ronaldinho to go to beijing .
but the situation is different for under-21 players .
fifa 's rules there have sometimes been interpreted as meaning that clubs must allow them to compete for their national sides .
that 's put hertha berlin at odds with promising young midfielder , gojko kacar , who 's received a call-up form serbia .
kacar says he would like to play in beijing , while hertha desperately want to have him in the german capital to start the season .
the two parties have yet to reach agreement .
display window bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics can be a valuable learning experience for youngsters like breno clubs do n't have any objections , on the other hand , to non-regulars living out their olympic dreams .
hertha , for instance , have given solomon okoronko the green light to play for nigeria , perhaps hoping that the reserve striker will increase his market value with a good performance in beijing .
bayern munich have also signaled no objection to letting 18-year-old defensive talent breno , more of a project for the future than candidate for this season 's starting eleven , join the selecao light in china .
so while diego and rafihna will almost certainly be staying put and plying their trade in the daily grind of the bundesliga , some of their younger countrymen will have the chance to win gold medals this summer . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions .

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .
" our diplomacy is based on negotiations . "
iran 's fars news agency reported that the talks would start on july 19 , without citing a source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been chosen as an envoy to iran yet european leaders seemed to be hedging their bets this week .
iran has made no promise that it will suspend nuclear enrichment , which was the basis for any negotiations .
" the fact that there is no mention of suspending sensitive activities is clearly an issue , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier said in paris .
the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .
war of words continues iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has repeatedly insisted that iran will not give up its right to a nuclear program .
" no one in iran will go back from our nuclear position , " ahmadinejad said tuesday .
" we want dialogue for the benefit of all sides but within the framework of law and justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is under sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment he also promised swift retaliation in the case that the us or israel were to attack iran in an attempt to stop its nuclear program .
an aide to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei added that iran would not hesitate to " set fire " to israel and the us navy in the gulf if attacked .
" the first us shot on iran would set the united states ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said ali shirazi , a mid-ranking cleric who is khamenei 's representative to the naval forces of the elite revolutionary guards .
" tel aviv and the us fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in iran 's crushing response , " he said , according to the fars news agency .

the case has led to a debate over the legality of deporting german-born immigrants who commit crimes . even as the two young men 's sentences were being announced on tuesday , july 8 , top german politicians such as bavaria 's premier guenther beckstein were calling for both of them to be deported .
anyone who attacks someone else without provocation and kicks their head as if it were a football has no place in germany , beckstein said .
" first jail , then deportation ! "
germany 's largest tabloid bild proclaimed .
unwanted criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attackers are from immigrant backgrounds two young men , who grew up in germany , brutally beat an elderly man a few days before christmas last year .
the men admitted to the attack , saying they were angry after the retired teacher yelled at them for smoking in the subway .
a munich court handed down harsh sentences .
serkan a. , 21 , whose family comes from turkey , will spend the next 12 years in prison .
spyridon l. , of greek origin , was sentenced to 8.5 years of detention in a juvenile facility as he was 17 when the attack occurred .
the case was taken up as a political cause by some conservatives , who blamed young foreigners for increasing crime rates .
hans peter uhl , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and an expert on legal and interior ministry affairs agrees .
he said that the department responsible for foreigners should use the time while the men are incarcerated to prepare the legal case to have them deported .
not an open and closed case however , criminologist christian pfeiffer said that expelling the two men from the country could prove problematic .
when it comes to deportation , there needs to be a long debate , particularly in this case where the men have spent nearly all of their lives in germany , pfeiffer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men call southern germany home someone born here to immigrant parents is " made in germany " in the sense that he was raised in this society and his social contacts are here , pfeiffer said .
in past cases , courts have rejected deportation procedures against german-born foreigners .
munich city administrator wilfried blume-beyerle also said the situation needs to be examined before any action is taken .
it appears that serkan a. was born in germany and spyridon l. , since he is from greece , is a resident of the european union , blume-beyerle said .
the government must provide extremely good reasons to win a deportation order and in the case of spyridon l. , must also show that he is likely to re-offend .
men seen posing a danger bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann does n't believe that it will be difficult to deport the men .
the interior ministry will push for the corresponding deportation procedures to begin , he said .
" after the sentences are served , we must naturally do everything possible to ensure that these culprits leave our country . "
herrmann noted that the court handed down an extremely strong sentence for both the men .

france currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-nation eu . the french president apparently told his chinese counterpart hu jintao about his decision during their meeting wednesday in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , where leaders from the group of eight countries are discussing global issues . sarkozy had earlier suggested he might boycott the august 8 olympic opening ceremony in beijing and urged the chinese government to open talks with the dalai lama . media watchdog group reporters without borders has slammed sarkozy 's change of mind . " this is surrender in the middle of battle , an abandonment of all the commitments he made as a candidate and all the values our country embodies , " the group 's secretary-general robert menard said . warning from china sarkozy 's decision follows a harsh warning from china 's ambassador to france on tuesday , who said there would be " serious consequences " for sino-french relations if sarkozy met with the dalai lama .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

three of the passengers got out of the car and fired at police starting a firefight that lasted between seven and eight minutes .
istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters at the scene that three attackers and one police officer were declared dead at the scene and that two police officers were later pronounced dead at a local hospital .
guler said that two police officers were wounded in the attack and were being treated for non life-threatening injuries at a local hospital .
the driver of the car reportedly fled the scene sparking a large- scale police search .
authorities label attack a " terrorist " event istanbul chief prosecutor aykut cengiz engin touring the scene said that the attackers armed with handguns and pump-action shotguns were aged between 25 and 30 and that investigators were seeking to find whether the gunmen had any links to any known terrorist groups .
" we are treating this as a terrorist attack , " engin said at the scene .
us ambassador to turkey ross wilson told reporters in ankara that all us personnel at the consulate were safe and accounted and expressed his country 's sadness for the loss of turkish lives .
he said the embassy had not received any threats in recent days and that u.s. security officials were cooperating with turkish police to solve what he described as a " dastardly and cowardly act " .
" it is inappropriate now to speculate who was responsible for this or what why they carried out this action .
it is an obvious act of terrorism .
our countries will stand together to confront this as we have confronted similar problems in the past , " wilson said .
wilson also said that he had asked for extra security at us consulates and at the embassy in ankara .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice , on a visit to tbilisi , voiced " deep regret " at the loss of life and highlighted the " very rapid and proper response " by turkish officials .
turkish interior minister besir atalay said no one had yet claimed responsibility for the incident .

the most recent attack on a foreign mission in turkey was in 2003 when al qaeda militants detonated a car bomb at the british consulate in central istanbul , and simultaneously attacked the british hsbc bank .
the british consul was killed in the attacks , which followed the bombings five days earlier of two synagogues in istanbul .

three of the passengers got out of the car and fired at police starting a firefight that lasted between seven and eight minutes .
istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters at the scene that three attackers and one police officer were declared dead at the scene and that two police officers were later pronounced dead at a local hospital .
guler said that two police officers were wounded in the attack and were being treated for non life-threatening injuries at a local hospital .
the driver of the car reportedly fled the scene sparking a large- scale police search .
authorities label attack a " terrorist " event istanbul chief prosecutor aykut cengiz engin touring the scene said that the attackers armed with handguns and pump-action shotguns were aged between 25 and 30 and that investigators were seeking to find whether the gunmen had any links to any known terrorist groups .

us ambassador to turkey ross wilson told reporters in ankara that all us personnel at the consulate were safe and accounted and expressed his country 's sadness for the loss of turkish lives .
he said the embassy had not received any threats in recent days and that u.s. security officials were cooperating with turkish police to solve what he described as a " dastardly and cowardly act " .
" it is inappropriate now to speculate who was responsible for this or what why they carried out this action .
it is an obvious act of terrorism .
our countries will stand together to confront this as we have confronted similar problems in the past , " wilson said .
wilson also said that he had asked for extra security at us consulates and at the embassy in ankara .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice , on a visit to tbilisi , voiced " deep regret " at the loss of life and highlighted the " very rapid and proper response " by turkish officials .
turkish interior minister besir atalay said no one had yet claimed responsibility for the incident .

the most recent attack on a foreign mission in turkey was in 2003 when al qaeda militants detonated a car bomb at the british consulate in central istanbul , and simultaneously attacked the british hsbc bank .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .

" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .
but a statement issued by tsvangarai 's movement for democratic change party dismissed that report , calling it " a figment of the dictatorship 's imagination . "

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .
negotiations - or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwean opposition supporters are calling on the west for help instead of sanctions , russia has promoted negotiations as means of solving the crisis in zimbabwe - a course of action also favored by the african union .

three of the passengers got out of the car and fired at police starting a firefight that lasted between seven and eight minutes .
istanbul governor muammer guler told reporters at the scene that three attackers and one police officer were declared dead at the scene and that two police officers were later pronounced dead at a local hospital .
guler said that two police officers were wounded in the attack and were being treated for non life-threatening injuries at a local hospital .
the driver of the car reportedly fled the scene sparking a large- scale police search .
authorities label attack a " terrorist " event istanbul chief prosecutor aykut cengiz engin touring the scene said that the attackers armed with handguns and pump-action shotguns were aged between 25 and 30 and that investigators were seeking to find whether the gunmen had any links to any known terrorist groups .
" we are treating this as a terrorist attack , " engin said at the scene .
us ambassador to turkey ross wilson told reporters in ankara that all us personnel at the consulate were safe and accounted and expressed his country 's sadness for the loss of turkish lives .
he said the embassy had not received any threats in recent days and that u.s. security officials were cooperating with turkish police to solve what he described as a " dastardly and cowardly act " .
" it is inappropriate now to speculate who was responsible for this or what why they carried out this action .
it is an obvious act of terrorism .
our countries will stand together to confront this as we have confronted similar problems in the past , " wilson said .
wilson also said that he had asked for extra security at us consulates and at the embassy in ankara .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice , on a visit to tbilisi , voiced " deep regret " at the loss of life and highlighted the " very rapid and proper response " by turkish officials .
turkish interior minister besir atalay said no one had yet claimed responsibility for the incident .

the most recent attack on a foreign mission in turkey was in 2003 when al qaeda militants detonated a car bomb at the british consulate in central istanbul , and simultaneously attacked the british hsbc bank .

the case has led to a debate over the legality of deporting german-born immigrants who commit crimes . even as the two young men 's sentences were being announced on tuesday , july 8 , top german politicians such as bavaria 's premier guenther beckstein were calling for both of them to be deported .
anyone who attacks someone else without provocation and kicks their head as if it were a football has no place in germany , beckstein said .
" first jail , then deportation ! "
germany 's largest tabloid bild proclaimed .
unwanted criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attackers are from immigrant backgrounds two young men , who grew up in germany , brutally beat an elderly man a few days before christmas last year .
the men admitted to the attack , saying they were angry after the retired teacher yelled at them for smoking in the subway .
a munich court handed down harsh sentences .
serkan a. , 21 , whose family comes from turkey , will spend the next 12 years in prison .
spyridon l. , of greek origin , was sentenced to 8.5 years of detention in a juvenile facility as he was 17 when the attack occurred .
the case was taken up as a political cause by some conservatives , who blamed young foreigners for increasing crime rates .
hans peter uhl , a member of parliament for the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and an expert on legal and interior ministry affairs agrees .
he said that the department responsible for foreigners should use the time while the men are incarcerated to prepare the legal case to have them deported .
not an open and closed case however , criminologist christian pfeiffer said that expelling the two men from the country could prove problematic .
when it comes to deportation , there needs to be a long debate , particularly in this case where the men have spent nearly all of their lives in germany , pfeiffer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both men call southern germany home someone born here to immigrant parents is " made in germany " in the sense that he was raised in this society and his social contacts are here , pfeiffer said .
in past cases , courts have rejected deportation procedures against german-born foreigners .
munich city administrator wilfried blume-beyerle also said the situation needs to be examined before any action is taken .
it appears that serkan a. was born in germany and spyridon l. , since he is from greece , is a resident of the european union , blume-beyerle said .
the government must provide extremely good reasons to win a deportation order and in the case of spyridon l. , must also show that he is likely to re-offend .
men seen posing a danger bavaria 's interior minister joachim herrmann does n't believe that it will be difficult to deport the men .
the interior ministry will push for the corresponding deportation procedures to begin , he said .
" after the sentences are served , we must naturally do everything possible to ensure that these culprits leave our country . "
herrmann noted that the court handed down an extremely strong sentence for both the men .
this is a clear signal that the men pose a danger and that deportation is in order , herrmann said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice .

" our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement .

" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture . " " if you are talking about military action , this of course is not the case , " churkin said in new york . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the 26-year-old rider 's first tour stage victory . schumacher led the pack in an individual time trial in and around the western city of cholet on tuesday , taking the race leader 's yellow jersey .
the previous holder , frenchman romain feillu , lagged in 169th place .
schumacher 's time for the 29.5-kilometer -lrb- 18.3-mile -rrb- course was 35 minutes 44 seconds , with an average speed of 49.5 kph -lrb- 30.8 mph -rrb- .
luxembourg 's kim kirchen finished 18 seconds behind schumacher , with david millar of britain in third .
schumacher now leads kirchen in the standings by 12 seconds , with millar in third , also 12 seconds behind .
" this is extraordinary , " a delighted schumacher told french television .
" the course was perfect for me , because it had climbs and descents .
it 's great to be on the podium in the tour de france . "
drug questions follow him schumacher 's future in cycling was in doubt late last year when police found traces of amphetamine in his blood after a minor traffic accident .
schumacher said at the time that he did n't have the slightest idea how the drug came into his body .
german cycling officials said that since the drug was not detected in an official test , he would not be suspended .

airlines say it will drive up the cost of air travel . european legislators on tuesday , july 8 , gave their overwhelming approval , 640 votes to 30 , to a compromise with the eu council of ministers , allowing the emissions trading plan to come into force in four years time . under the program , airlines receive rights to emit a specified tonnage of carbon dioxide annually .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house mccain would be good for trans-atlantic trade , says expert top democrat promises obama , mccain would ' listen to europe ' world opinion sways us voters , ambassador says german expert praises mccain 's tightrope walk with palin united states -pipe- 09.07.2008 opinion : europeans should prepare for obama disappointment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans welcomed the news that the democratic presidential hopeful would visit berlin and other major european cities this month .
but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions . " but the presence of big developing countries also highlighted differences between them and g8 members on the best way to tackle emissions reduction .
both recognized that " deep cuts " were needed in order to combat climate change , they failed to agree on setting specific targets , saying only that the reduction in greenhouse gases should take place according to the means of each country . and no mention of the g8 's " 50 by 50 " target was made in the joint statement with developing countries , evidence that big polluters such as china and india were not yet willing to commit themselves to internationally agreed cuts . the discussion on global warming now moves on to poznan , poland , where world leaders will take part in december in a conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of a decisive summit in copenhagen next year . japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said that resolving the differences between the european union , which had pushed for heavy cuts , and the united states , which resisted them , the g8 had " contributed to building momentum for the un negotiations . " africa aid in japan , g8 leaders had also come under intense pressure to stick to their pledge to increase aid to africa and help meet the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
these include halving global hunger and getting every child into primary school by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged more money for aid to africa g8 leaders set a five-year deadline to commit $ 60 billion in funding to help the continent fight disease . while they also reaffirmed their wish to increase , by 2010 , annual aid to africa by $ 25 billion , pressure groups complained that the leaders had failed to spell out exactly how such commitments would be met . " the outcome of the g8 summit is nothing but an exercise in escapism .
it is non-committal on major issues confronting the majority of the world 's poor people , " said actionaid , a pressure group . oxfam international said it hoped key decisions would now be made at a special food crisis summit held by the un in new york in september . oil and food the poor state of the global economy also featured high on the g8 agenda , with leaders warning that spiralling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is " seriously concerned " about rising food prices " we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement . they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
they called for an increase in oil production and refining capacities and for the building of more nuclear power plants . g8 leaders also expressed " serious concern " about the surge in food prices , saying they had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . " the asked nations with sufficient food stocks to release some of them to help others cope with soaring prices . zimbabwe g8 leaders also urged iran to stop its nuclear program and issued a statement voicing " grave concern " about the violence-marred re-election in zimbabwe last month of robert mugabe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president robert mugabe casting his vote in harare the summit " made it clear we would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime that has blood on its hands , " british prime minister gordon brown said , rallying world support for un sanctions on harare . however , due to russian opposition , it was not entirely clear whether the g8 had reached a consensus on the imposition of any new sanctions . fukuda said the matter would be referred to the un security council in new york . " -lrb- we had -rrb- a lot of meetings on important subjects , and we accomplished a lot , " said george w. bush , who was attending his final g8 as president of the united states . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia .
they account for two-thirds of the world 's gross domestic product . but as the summit closed wednesday , german chancellor angela merkel said : " the g8 is no longer enough to solve many of the problems .

but not all g8 members were reading from the same script . the g8 leaders had spent two days trying to negotiate a common position on zimbabwe after the june 27 re-election of president robert mugabe in a vote from which opposition leader morgan tsvangarai pulled out , citing violence against his supporters .
in a joint statement , the g8 leaders condemned the way the election had proceeded .
" we do not accept the legitimacy of any government that does not reflect the will of the zimbabwean people , " the g8 leaders said .
" we deplore the fact that the zimbabwean authorities pressed ahead with the presidential election despite the absence of appropriate conditions for free and fair voting as a result of their systematic violence , obstruction and intimidation , " they added .
the aim , the leaders said , would be to punish those responsible for voter intimidation in the southern african nation .
" we will take further steps , inter alia introducing financial and other measures against those individuals responsible for the violence , " the statement read .
the g8 also recommended that the united nations appoint a special envoy to report on zimbabwe 's humanitarian and human rights situation .
not far enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has ruled zimbabwe since 1980 british prime minister gordon brown , whose country has led international criticism of mugabe , was at pains to claim that the g8 declaration was appropriately vigorous .
" this is the strongest possible statement , " brown told reporters .
" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .
but they were thwarted by opposition from russia .
" we do n't believe that in this case sanctions are an effective tool to improve the situation , " russian official alexander pankin told dpa news agency .

one of zimbabwe 's state-controlled newspapers reported on tuesday , july 8 that mugabe and tsvangarai would hold talks under the mediation of south african president thabo mbeki .

" it shows the unanimity of the whole international community , reflecting the outrage people feel about the violence and the intimidation and the illegitimate holding of power by the mugabe government . "
but such words of praise could not conceal the fact that the statement , which stopped short of using the term sanctions , is less robust than most g8 members would have liked .
french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel have both indicated that they would support a un resolution imposing sanctions on mugabe - as has the united states .

but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .

but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .

the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .

it was the 26-year-old rider 's first tour stage victory . schumacher led the pack in an individual time trial in and around the western city of cholet on tuesday , taking the race leader 's yellow jersey .

luxembourg 's kim kirchen finished 18 seconds behind schumacher , with david millar of britain in third .

" the course was perfect for me , because it had climbs and descents .
it 's great to be on the podium in the tour de france . "
drug questions follow him schumacher 's future in cycling was in doubt late last year when police found traces of amphetamine in his blood after a minor traffic accident .
schumacher said at the time that he did n't have the slightest idea how the drug came into his body .
german cycling officials said that since the drug was not detected in an official test , he would not be suspended .

valverde now stands 17th , 1 minute and 27 seconds behind schumacher and 1 minute and 6 seconds behind evans .

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions . " but the presence of big developing countries also highlighted differences between them and g8 members on the best way to tackle emissions reduction .
both recognized that " deep cuts " were needed in order to combat climate change , they failed to agree on setting specific targets , saying only that the reduction in greenhouse gases should take place according to the means of each country . and no mention of the g8 's " 50 by 50 " target was made in the joint statement with developing countries , evidence that big polluters such as china and india were not yet willing to commit themselves to internationally agreed cuts . the discussion on global warming now moves on to poznan , poland , where world leaders will take part in december in a conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of a decisive summit in copenhagen next year . japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said that resolving the differences between the european union , which had pushed for heavy cuts , and the united states , which resisted them , the g8 had " contributed to building momentum for the un negotiations .

" the outcome of the g8 summit is nothing but an exercise in escapism .
it is non-committal on major issues confronting the majority of the world 's poor people , " said actionaid , a pressure group . oxfam international said it hoped key decisions would now be made at a special food crisis summit held by the un in new york in september . oil and food the poor state of the global economy also featured high on the g8 agenda , with leaders warning that spiralling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is " seriously concerned " about rising food prices " we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement . they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
they called for an increase in oil production and refining capacities and for the building of more nuclear power plants . g8 leaders also expressed " serious concern " about the surge in food prices , saying they had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . " the asked nations with sufficient food stocks to release some of them to help others cope with soaring prices . zimbabwe g8 leaders also urged iran to stop its nuclear program and issued a statement voicing " grave concern " about the violence-marred re-election in zimbabwe last month of robert mugabe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president robert mugabe casting his vote in harare the summit " made it clear we would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime that has blood on its hands , " british prime minister gordon brown said , rallying world support for un sanctions on harare . however , due to russian opposition , it was not entirely clear whether the g8 had reached a consensus on the imposition of any new sanctions . fukuda said the matter would be referred to the un security council in new york . " -lrb- we had -rrb- a lot of meetings on important subjects , and we accomplished a lot , " said george w. bush , who was attending his final g8 as president of the united states . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia .
they account for two-thirds of the world 's gross domestic product . but as the summit closed wednesday , german chancellor angela merkel said : " the g8 is no longer enough to solve many of the problems .

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions . " but the presence of big developing countries also highlighted differences between them and g8 members on the best way to tackle emissions reduction .
both recognized that " deep cuts " were needed in order to combat climate change , they failed to agree on setting specific targets , saying only that the reduction in greenhouse gases should take place according to the means of each country . and no mention of the g8 's " 50 by 50 " target was made in the joint statement with developing countries , evidence that big polluters such as china and india were not yet willing to commit themselves to internationally agreed cuts . the discussion on global warming now moves on to poznan , poland , where world leaders will take part in december in a conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of a decisive summit in copenhagen next year . japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said that resolving the differences between the european union , which had pushed for heavy cuts , and the united states , which resisted them , the g8 had " contributed to building momentum for the un negotiations . " africa aid in japan , g8 leaders had also come under intense pressure to stick to their pledge to increase aid to africa and help meet the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
these include halving global hunger and getting every child into primary school by 2015 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged more money for aid to africa g8 leaders set a five-year deadline to commit $ 60 billion in funding to help the continent fight disease . while they also reaffirmed their wish to increase , by 2010 , annual aid to africa by $ 25 billion , pressure groups complained that the leaders had failed to spell out exactly how such commitments would be met . " the outcome of the g8 summit is nothing but an exercise in escapism .
it is non-committal on major issues confronting the majority of the world 's poor people , " said actionaid , a pressure group . oxfam international said it hoped key decisions would now be made at a special food crisis summit held by the un in new york in september . oil and food the poor state of the global economy also featured high on the g8 agenda , with leaders warning that spiralling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is " seriously concerned " about rising food prices " we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement . they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
they called for an increase in oil production and refining capacities and for the building of more nuclear power plants . g8 leaders also expressed " serious concern " about the surge in food prices , saying they had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure . " the asked nations with sufficient food stocks to release some of them to help others cope with soaring prices . zimbabwe g8 leaders also urged iran to stop its nuclear program and issued a statement voicing " grave concern " about the violence-marred re-election in zimbabwe last month of robert mugabe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president robert mugabe casting his vote in harare the summit " made it clear we would impose new sanctions against an illegitimate regime that has blood on its hands , " british prime minister gordon brown said , rallying world support for un sanctions on harare . however , due to russian opposition , it was not entirely clear whether the g8 had reached a consensus on the imposition of any new sanctions . fukuda said the matter would be referred to the un security council in new york . " -lrb- we had -rrb- a lot of meetings on important subjects , and we accomplished a lot , " said george w. bush , who was attending his final g8 as president of the united states . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia .
they account for two-thirds of the world 's gross domestic product . but as the summit closed wednesday , german chancellor angela merkel said : " the g8 is no longer enough to solve many of the problems .

the previous holder , frenchman romain feillu , lagged in 169th place .
schumacher 's time for the 29.5-kilometer -lrb- 18.3-mile -rrb- course was 35 minutes 44 seconds , with an average speed of 49.5 kph -lrb- 30.8 mph -rrb- .
luxembourg 's kim kirchen finished 18 seconds behind schumacher , with david millar of britain in third .
schumacher now leads kirchen in the standings by 12 seconds , with millar in third , also 12 seconds behind .
" this is extraordinary , " a delighted schumacher told french television .
" the course was perfect for me , because it had climbs and descents .
it 's great to be on the podium in the tour de france . "
drug questions follow him schumacher 's future in cycling was in doubt late last year when police found traces of amphetamine in his blood after a minor traffic accident .
schumacher said at the time that he did n't have the slightest idea how the drug came into his body .
german cycling officials said that since the drug was not detected in an official test , he would not be suspended .
race remains tight australian cadel evans finished fourth on tuesday , 27 seconds behind the winner .
but he gained valuable time on his rivals for the title , especially spaniard alejandro valverde , who finished 23rd , 1 minute and 34 seconds behind the winner .
valverde now stands 17th , 1 minute and 27 seconds behind schumacher and 1 minute and 6 seconds behind evans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 09.07.2008 concerns mount in europe over mixed messages from iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad insists that iran 's nuclear program is not up for negotiation iran said it is ready to begin negotiations over its nuclear program .
but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .
" our diplomacy is based on negotiations . "
iran 's fars news agency reported that the talks would start on july 19 , without citing a source .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has been chosen as an envoy to iran yet european leaders seemed to be hedging their bets this week .
iran has made no promise that it will suspend nuclear enrichment , which was the basis for any negotiations .
" the fact that there is no mention of suspending sensitive activities is clearly an issue , " france 's foreign ministry spokesman eric chevallier said in paris .
the west worries that iran wants to enrich uranium to make material for nuclear weapons .
the oil-rich country insists it wants the technology to provide fuel for power plants .
war of words continues iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has repeatedly insisted that iran will not give up its right to a nuclear program .
" no one in iran will go back from our nuclear position , " ahmadinejad said tuesday .
" we want dialogue for the benefit of all sides but within the framework of law and justice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is under sanctions for refusing to halt uranium enrichment he also promised swift retaliation in the case that the us or israel were to attack iran in an attempt to stop its nuclear program .
an aide to supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei added that iran would not hesitate to " set fire " to israel and the us navy in the gulf if attacked .
" the first us shot on iran would set the united states ' vital interests in the world on fire , " said ali shirazi , a mid-ranking cleric who is khamenei 's representative to the naval forces of the elite revolutionary guards .
" tel aviv and the us fleet in the persian gulf would be the targets that would be set on fire in iran 's crushing response , " he said , according to the fars news agency .
iran has repeatedly warned of a crushing response to any aggression against its soil , but more specific warnings are unusual . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but taking up those invitations would mean missing the start of the season - and angering their bosses . it 's a problem that crops up every four years .
olympic invitations are especially welcome to star footballers , such as bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego , who 've had trouble establishing themselves as regulars in their national sides .
" i am pleased and delighted to be called for a major competition and traditional -lsb- sic -rsb- as the olympic games , even more than the fact that i will play for brazil which is in search of an unprecedented achievement , " announced the gifted midfielder in rather garbled translation on his website , after learning of his nomination by brazil coach carlos dunga .
but the olympic soccer competition , which runs from august 7-23 , coincides with the first weeks of the 2008-9 bundesliga season .
and bremen 's sport director klaus allofs is not amused .
" what needs to be said , we 'll say to diego face-to-face , " said allofs in a terse statement to the daily bild newspaper .
bremen is n't the only team with a star player caught between club and country .
rafinha , who plays for bremen 's opponents in the second week of the season , schalke , has also been nominated for brazil .
driver 's seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafinha , l , says he understands schalke 's position schalke has said they will not release rafinha to play in the summer games , and the defender has accepted that decision - with good reason .
because the olympics - never known as a major football competition - are not part of the official calendar of the sport 's governing body , fifa , clubs are under no obligation to give their players time off to compete in them .
barcelona , for instance , has already said it will not allow star playmaker ronaldinho to go to beijing .
but the situation is different for under-21 players .
fifa 's rules there have sometimes been interpreted as meaning that clubs must allow them to compete for their national sides .
that 's put hertha berlin at odds with promising young midfielder , gojko kacar , who 's received a call-up form serbia .
kacar says he would like to play in beijing , while hertha desperately want to have him in the german capital to start the season .
the two parties have yet to reach agreement .
display window bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics can be a valuable learning experience for youngsters like breno clubs do n't have any objections , on the other hand , to non-regulars living out their olympic dreams .
hertha , for instance , have given solomon okoronko the green light to play for nigeria , perhaps hoping that the reserve striker will increase his market value with a good performance in beijing .
bayern munich have also signaled no objection to letting 18-year-old defensive talent breno , more of a project for the future than candidate for this season 's starting eleven , join the selecao light in china .
so while diego and rafihna will almost certainly be staying put and plying their trade in the daily grind of the bundesliga , some of their younger countrymen will have the chance to win gold medals this summer . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 09.07.2008 concerns mount in europe over mixed messages from iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad insists that iran 's nuclear program is not up for negotiation iran said it is ready to begin negotiations over its nuclear program .
but it continued to anger the west by firing test missiles over the persian gulf on wednesday , july 9 . europe 's foreign policy chief javier solana will likely travel to iran later this month in an attempt to clarify iran 's nuclear intentions .
but iran 's recent displays of military force could further complicate what were already expected to be tricky talks .
on wednesday , the german government accused tehran of " saber rattling " after the country fired nine missiles over the gulf during a military exercise .
germany noted the tests " with concern " as the missiles are suitable for carrying nuclear warheads .
the missiles reportedly have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- , making them capable of hitting targets in israel .
iran said the tests should not be viewed as an act of aggression .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran told to refrain from " saber rattling " " our missile capacity is just for defensive purposes and not supposed to threaten any country but for safeguarding peace in iran and the -lrb- persian gulf -rrb- region , " mostafa mohammad-najar told state television .
solana traveled to tehran in june with an offer of technological and economic incentives in exchange for iran agreeing to suspend its uranium enrichment .
tehran responded to that overture with " a gesture of ill will , " steg said , according to the dpa news agency .
yet germany , along with other leaders at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in japan , said they had not given up on a negotiated solution to the crisis . ready to negotiate despite the missile tests , iran insists that it is ready to meet with solana .
on friday , iran sent a proposal which has not been made public to the group of six nations - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - who had offered the incentive package last month .
" talks will start in the next few days and at that time many issues will become clear , " said mohammad saeedi , deputy head of iran 's atomic energy organization .

nor did leaders agree on any medium-term cuts , as many had hoped .
environmentalists and developing countries called the deal toothless . " on climate change , this summit will be seen as a setback , particularly since there is no baseline for the emission cuts and no medium-term objectives , " james meers , an analyst at the munk centre , a canadian think-tank that assesses the results of g8s , told the dpa news agency . new attendees the summit in toyako , in japan 's northern island of hokkaido , was the largest ever , with a total of 22 countries represented . for the first time , at the request of us president george w bush , g8 leaders also held an enlarged meeting of major economies -lrb- mem -rrb- with australia , brazil , china , india , indonesia , mexico , south korea and south africa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rich and developing countries did not agree on a emissions strategy during wednesday 's mem meeting , both rich and developing nations committed themselves to " a long-term global goal for emission reductions . " but the presence of big developing countries also highlighted differences between them and g8 members on the best way to tackle emissions reduction .
both recognized that " deep cuts " were needed in order to combat climate change , they failed to agree on setting specific targets , saying only that the reduction in greenhouse gases should take place according to the means of each country . and no mention of the g8 's " 50 by 50 " target was made in the joint statement with developing countries , evidence that big polluters such as china and india were not yet willing to commit themselves to internationally agreed cuts . the discussion on global warming now moves on to poznan , poland , where world leaders will take part in december in a conference of the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of a decisive summit in copenhagen next year . japanese prime minister yasuo fukuda said that resolving the differences between the european union , which had pushed for heavy cuts , and the united states , which resisted them , the g8 had " contributed to building momentum for the un negotiations . " africa aid in japan , g8 leaders had also come under intense pressure to stick to their pledge to increase aid to africa and help meet the un 's millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .

" the outcome of the g8 summit is nothing but an exercise in escapism .
it is non-committal on major issues confronting the majority of the world 's poor people , " said actionaid , a pressure group . oxfam international said it hoped key decisions would now be made at a special food crisis summit held by the un in new york in september . oil and food the poor state of the global economy also featured high on the g8 agenda , with leaders warning that spiralling oil prices posed a serious threat to future growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 is " seriously concerned " about rising food prices " we have strong concerns about the sharp rise in oil prices , which poses risks to the global economy , " they said in a statement . they agreed to hold a special energy forum that should focus on energy efficiency and new technologies .
they called for an increase in oil production and refining capacities and for the building of more nuclear power plants . g8 leaders also expressed " serious concern " about the surge in food prices , saying they had " serious implications for the most vulnerable " while also adding to " global inflationary pressure .

" -lrb- we had -rrb- a lot of meetings on important subjects , and we accomplished a lot , " said george w. bush , who was attending his final g8 as president of the united states . the g8 comprises the world 's seven richest countries - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan and the united states - plus russia .
they account for two-thirds of the world 's gross domestic product . but as the summit closed wednesday , german chancellor angela merkel said : " the g8 is no longer enough to solve many of the problems .

olympic invitations are especially welcome to star footballers , such as bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego , who 've had trouble establishing themselves as regulars in their national sides .

but taking up those invitations would mean missing the start of the season - and angering their bosses . it 's a problem that crops up every four years .
olympic invitations are especially welcome to star footballers , such as bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego , who 've had trouble establishing themselves as regulars in their national sides .
" i am pleased and delighted to be called for a major competition and traditional -lsb- sic -rsb- as the olympic games , even more than the fact that i will play for brazil which is in search of an unprecedented achievement , " announced the gifted midfielder in rather garbled translation on his website , after learning of his nomination by brazil coach carlos dunga .
but the olympic soccer competition , which runs from august 7-23 , coincides with the first weeks of the 2008-9 bundesliga season .
and bremen 's sport director klaus allofs is not amused .
" what needs to be said , we 'll say to diego face-to-face , " said allofs in a terse statement to the daily bild newspaper .
bremen is n't the only team with a star player caught between club and country .
rafinha , who plays for bremen 's opponents in the second week of the season , schalke , has also been nominated for brazil .
driver 's seat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafinha , l , says he understands schalke 's position schalke has said they will not release rafinha to play in the summer games , and the defender has accepted that decision - with good reason .
because the olympics - never known as a major football competition - are not part of the official calendar of the sport 's governing body , fifa , clubs are under no obligation to give their players time off to compete in them .
barcelona , for instance , has already said it will not allow star playmaker ronaldinho to go to beijing .
but the situation is different for under-21 players .
fifa 's rules there have sometimes been interpreted as meaning that clubs must allow them to compete for their national sides .
that 's put hertha berlin at odds with promising young midfielder , gojko kacar , who 's received a call-up form serbia .
kacar says he would like to play in beijing , while hertha desperately want to have him in the german capital to start the season .
the two parties have yet to reach agreement .
display window bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympics can be a valuable learning experience for youngsters like breno clubs do n't have any objections , on the other hand , to non-regulars living out their olympic dreams .
hertha , for instance , have given solomon okoronko the green light to play for nigeria , perhaps hoping that the reserve striker will increase his market value with a good performance in beijing .
bayern munich have also signaled no objection to letting 18-year-old defensive talent breno , more of a project for the future than candidate for this season 's starting eleven , join the selecao light in china .
so while diego and rafihna will almost certainly be staying put and plying their trade in the daily grind of the bundesliga , some of their younger countrymen will have the chance to win gold medals this summer . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

moscow has said it may respond with military action . russia warned late tuesday that it would use a " military-technical " response to the us missile shield system which washington wants to deploy in poland and the czech republic . moscow has said the missile shield would increase tensions in europe and expressed fears it could be used to spy on russia instead of , as washington says , protecting europe against missile attacks by so-called rogue states like iran . the warning , reported by itar-tass news agency quoting the russian foreign ministry , came as us secretary of state condoleezza rice completed a deal in prague for the czechs to host the system 's radar installation . " if the agreement with the united states liable for ratification by the czech parliament eventually becomes a law , and the deployment of us missile defense elements really starts in direct proximity to our borders , we will have to use military-technical rather than diplomatic methods , " the russian ministry statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech foreign minister schwarzenberg and us secretary of state rice sign the deal " russia will have to take appropriate measures and compensate the forming of potential threats to its national security .
this is not our choice . " washington played down moscow 's saber rattling , urging russia to join its defense program as an " equal partner . " " we seek strategic cooperation on preventing missiles from rogue nations like iran from threatening our friends and allies , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe .
" we will continue to have dialog with the russians . " radar deal rice and her czech counterpart karel schwarzenberg signed the treaty on tuesday under which the czech republic is to host the radar base for the missile shield the us plans to build . the us wants the radar base twinned with interceptor missiles in poland , although negotiations with warsaw have bogged down . the signing in prague went ahead even though the deal faces hurdles in the czech parliament where the center-right government of prime minister mirek topolanek will likely need opposition votes to get it ratified . but schwarzenberg told reporters after the signing ceremony that he believed lawmakers would vote in favor of the program . public opposition the us missile plan is not popular with the czech public .
an opinion poll last month showed that 68 percent of czechs are against the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner says " radar no , peace yes " police in prague prevented about 1,000 protestors on tuesday evening from marching to the hrzansky palace to hand over a protest letter to rice . " we believe that this could start another arms race , " frantisek smrcka , one of the protestors , told reuters news agency . the opponents want the government to delay further talks until after the november presidential election in the united states , in the hope that the new president will halt the project . " our government is unreasonably and madly rushing ahead , " said radar opponent jan neoral , mayor of a village nearby the planned radar site . cold war rhetoric analysts said moscow 's threat is a strategy to increase european opposition to the shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia says the missile system would be a threat to its national security pavel felgenhauer , a military analyst , said moscow was using rhetoric reminiscent of the cold war to discourage the czech parliament from ratifying the shield agreement . " that is why it is very unspecific , but sounds threatening , " he told reuters .
" it is psychological pressure , the same sort that was used in the 1980s by the soviet union , when the united states deployed cruise missiles in europe , in an attempt to boost the anti-missile , anti-us protests . " russia 's un ambassador vitaly churkin said the foreign ministry statement did not mean military action but rather a change in " strategic posture .

but jefferson chase says obama 's main task will be to avoid seeming too euro-friendly . recent united states ' electoral history is littered with the corpses of democratic presidential candidates who were perceived as being a bit too european for middle america 's liking .
in 1988 , mike dukakis blundered badly by suggesting that iowan farmers consider producing belgian endive , a vegetable most americans neither knew nor could pronounce .
in 2004 , john kerry 's european background and fluency in french rebounded against him , as republicans began starting speeches with the phrase " hello or , as john kerry would say , bonjour . "
one of the surest ways not to get elected president is make your fellow americans feel inferior .
it 's better to bubba it up like bill clinton and pretend to be less worldly than you are than to risk being perceived as an effete social climber who adopts foreign words and ideas - no matter how sensible they may be .
barack obama , who has already had to struggle against the elitist label , will be mindful of this when he does his grand tour of europe later in july .
tough love the news on tuesday july 8 that obama intends to pop by berlin on july 24 created an immediate buzz among germans , who prefer him by a margin of nearly seven-to-one to his older , less charismatic and more hawkish rival , republican candidate john mccain .
rarely , if ever , has a us president been so thoroughly loathed in europe as george w. bush .
and german obamaniacs would love to see their man deliver a firebrand speech proclaiming a return to policies of diplomacy over military intervention , environmental responsibility , and cooperation and consultation with america 's traditional western european allies .
fat chance .
obama 's main goal in berlin and elsewhere will be look presidential , which in the eyes of many americans means looking like someone who can keep europe under control .
perhaps for this reason , the obama camp would like its candidate to appear in front of the brandenburg gate , a site that symbolizes for many americans their victory in the cold war since it was where ronald reagan famously called upon russia to tear down the berlin wall in 1987 .
obama will no doubt utter some homilies about repairing the cracks in the " special friendship " between germany and the us that appeared in the context of the us-led war in iraq .
but he 's extremely unlikely to suggest that his policies , if elected , will be influenced by european opinions and perspectives .
obamagate ?
obama 's host , german chancellor angela merkel , faces a tightrope walk of her own .
merkel , like most european leaders , would probably be happier dealing with obama than mccain , given the arizona senator 's support for the war in iraq and american military interventionism in general .
but merkel has to hedge her bets to avoid creating bad blood with the republican , which would not be in germany 's interests , should he win the presidency .
some within the german government have questioned whether the brandenburg gate should be used for what will be , in essence , an american campaign speech .
and thus far , the only official reaction from the chancellor 's office has been that obama is welcome - as is mccain .
on the other hand , berlin mayor klaus wowereit - hardly unaware of the public relations value of a photo op with obama and crowds of adulators - has welcomed the idea of the candidate appearing at the brandenburg gate .
but if obama plays it strategically cool , as strategy dictates he must , in his speech , the publicity from being seen next to " europe 's choice for president " could be less positive than wowereit would have hoped . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over recent months england 's biggest house builders have shed thousands of jobs and share prices have plummeted as house sales have fallen away .
on monday , persimmon said it had cut 1,100 posts since the start of the year to try to cope with the downturn .
it reported that house sales in the first six months of the year were down by a record 31 % .
-lsb- developers -rcb- are maybe not moving as fast as they would have done a year ago rynd smith , rtpi about 2,000 jobs at rivals taylor wimpey and barratt developments have also gone or are set to be cut .
in the short term this could have a " severe " impact on the 15 new towns currently proposed for areas across england , according to the royal town planning institute -lrb- rtpi -rrb- .
persimmon and barratt are among leading developers that would be expected to build the towns .
but persimmon has already pulled out of an eco-town scheme in rossington , south yorkshire .
initial plans for a 15,000-home town on former colliery and green belt land were scaled down after criticism from the eco towns challenge panel .
uk coal , one of the partners in the consortium , said persimmon left after green belt land on which it had options was dropped from the development proposals .
john harris , chairman of the consortium , said it was down to the partnership , and not the house builders , to drive the proposals forward .
he said architect spawforths was currently drawing up revised plans for the town .
' rethink needed ' rynd smith , director of policy at the rtpi , said a combination of the credit crunch and political uncertainty could cause developers to hold back from committing money on designing them .
he said infrastructure , such as water supplies , schools , gp surgeries and roads , was expensive and that all this must be done before plans were submitted .
" just keeping that bandwagon rolling has a cost .
it could mean delay and in fact there could be some other potential reasons for delay which are around decision making uncertainty .
shares in house building firms have plummeted in recent months .
" we 're getting into a period where the potential movements of a future government become important . "
he said eco-town investors would either want to get plans firmly in place before the next general election , or largely hold off until after 2010 .
the conservatives have expressed opposition to the current eco-town plans .
" i suspect that given the economic conditions it is beginning to point to delay , " mr smith said .
" -lsb- developers -rsb- are maybe not moving as fast as they would have done a year ago to commit money to get new units of housing on the ground . "
he said he thought the government needed to rethink its whole housing policy in light of the economy 's current state .
' crisis will pass ' " if economic uncertainty continues for more than a few more months then the degree to which -lsb- eco-towns -rsb- are economically feasible will shift . "
a spokesman for the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- said it was vital that more homes were provided , but that the credit crunch could stop new towns being built .
the lga has criticised the proposed locations of many of the towns .
" the financial situation we 're in at the moment could mean that no one will be available to build them when we actually find the sites , " the spokesman said .
eco-town plans have sparked a number of protests but some claim the current economic crisis will pass without derailing plans for the new towns .
st modwen , which is behind the 6,000-home middle quinton scheme near long marston , warwickshire , insisted it was sticking to a tight timetable .
john dodds , regional director , said : " the selection process for eco-towns should surpass the current economic uncertainty .
" the government is not expected to make a decision about the final eco-town shortlist before 2009 .
' attractive to developers ' " should middle quinton be selected as one of the final 10 , our proposals will still be subject to a detailed planning application .
" considering these timelines , we would not realistically expect to be starting on site before 2012 , by which time we would expect the current economic uncertainty and the reported housing crisis to have subsided .
" if middle quinton is selected , we expect the development opportunities it would offer to be very attractive to the house building sector . "
while abigail davies , head of policy for the chartered institute of housing , agreed the downturn would not kill eco-towns .
" i do n't think you can ignore the current problems , but because of -lsb- the towns ' -rsb- nature it 's not going to make it grind to a halt . "
but she said the affordable element of eco-towns had to be flexible to respond to local demands .
" i suspect -lsb- the homes -rsb- will appeal to a certain type of people who move there as a lifestyle choice . "
a spokesman for the department for communities and local government said : " it is important to remember that the first eco-towns are n't due to be completed until 2016 .
" the conditions remain in place for a healthy housing market over the long-term , including the fundamental mismatch between demand and supply . "

a spokesman for the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- said it was vital that more homes were provided , but that the credit crunch could stop new towns being built .
the lga has criticised the proposed locations of many of the towns .
" the financial situation we 're in at the moment could mean that no one will be available to build them when we actually find the sites , " the spokesman said .
eco-town plans have sparked a number of protests but some claim the current economic crisis will pass without derailing plans for the new towns .
st modwen , which is behind the 6,000-home middle quinton scheme near long marston , warwickshire , insisted it was sticking to a tight timetable .
john dodds , regional director , said : " the selection process for eco-towns should surpass the current economic uncertainty .

over recent months england 's biggest house builders have shed thousands of jobs and share prices have plummeted as house sales have fallen away .
on monday , persimmon said it had cut 1,100 posts since the start of the year to try to cope with the downturn .
it reported that house sales in the first six months of the year were down by a record 31 % .
-lsb- developers -rcb- are maybe not moving as fast as they would have done a year ago rynd smith , rtpi about 2,000 jobs at rivals taylor wimpey and barratt developments have also gone or are set to be cut .
in the short term this could have a " severe " impact on the 15 new towns currently proposed for areas across england , according to the royal town planning institute -lrb- rtpi -rrb- .
persimmon and barratt are among leading developers that would be expected to build the towns .
but persimmon has already pulled out of an eco-town scheme in rossington , south yorkshire .
initial plans for a 15,000-home town on former colliery and green belt land were scaled down after criticism from the eco towns challenge panel .
uk coal , one of the partners in the consortium , said persimmon left after green belt land on which it had options was dropped from the development proposals .
john harris , chairman of the consortium , said it was down to the partnership , and not the house builders , to drive the proposals forward .
he said architect spawforths was currently drawing up revised plans for the town .
' rethink needed ' rynd smith , director of policy at the rtpi , said a combination of the credit crunch and political uncertainty could cause developers to hold back from committing money on designing them .
he said infrastructure , such as water supplies , schools , gp surgeries and roads , was expensive and that all this must be done before plans were submitted .
" just keeping that bandwagon rolling has a cost .
it could mean delay and in fact there could be some other potential reasons for delay which are around decision making uncertainty .
shares in house building firms have plummeted in recent months .
" we 're getting into a period where the potential movements of a future government become important . "
he said eco-town investors would either want to get plans firmly in place before the next general election , or largely hold off until after 2010 .
the conservatives have expressed opposition to the current eco-town plans .
" i suspect that given the economic conditions it is beginning to point to delay , " mr smith said .
" -lsb- developers -rsb- are maybe not moving as fast as they would have done a year ago to commit money to get new units of housing on the ground . "
he said he thought the government needed to rethink its whole housing policy in light of the economy 's current state .
' crisis will pass ' " if economic uncertainty continues for more than a few more months then the degree to which -lsb- eco-towns -rsb- are economically feasible will shift . "
a spokesman for the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- said it was vital that more homes were provided , but that the credit crunch could stop new towns being built .
the lga has criticised the proposed locations of many of the towns .
" the financial situation we 're in at the moment could mean that no one will be available to build them when we actually find the sites , " the spokesman said .
eco-town plans have sparked a number of protests but some claim the current economic crisis will pass without derailing plans for the new towns .
st modwen , which is behind the 6,000-home middle quinton scheme near long marston , warwickshire , insisted it was sticking to a tight timetable .
john dodds , regional director , said : " the selection process for eco-towns should surpass the current economic uncertainty .
" the government is not expected to make a decision about the final eco-town shortlist before 2009 .
' attractive to developers ' " should middle quinton be selected as one of the final 10 , our proposals will still be subject to a detailed planning application .
" considering these timelines , we would not realistically expect to be starting on site before 2012 , by which time we would expect the current economic uncertainty and the reported housing crisis to have subsided .
" if middle quinton is selected , we expect the development opportunities it would offer to be very attractive to the house building sector . "
while abigail davies , head of policy for the chartered institute of housing , agreed the downturn would not kill eco-towns .
" i do n't think you can ignore the current problems , but because of -lsb- the towns ' -rsb- nature it 's not going to make it grind to a halt . "
but she said the affordable element of eco-towns had to be flexible to respond to local demands .
" i suspect -lsb- the homes -rsb- will appeal to a certain type of people who move there as a lifestyle choice . "
a spokesman for the department for communities and local government said : " it is important to remember that the first eco-towns are n't due to be completed until 2016 .
" the conditions remain in place for a healthy housing market over the long-term , including the fundamental mismatch between demand and supply . "

this is still a prison , run by the ministry of interior and housed inside secure premises with high perimeter walls and barbed wire , but the saudi authorities prefer to call it a " care centre " and refer to prisoners as " beneficiaries " .

in return for the more relaxed environment , prisoners have to attend religious education classes where islamic scholars challenge their views .
the thinking behind the new initiative is to fight al-qaeda 's ideology by convincing militant islamists they have a distorted view of islam .
the ministry of interior oversees the new scheme and has created the ideological security unit -lrb- isu -rrb- dedicated to co-ordinating their efforts .
" you can not defeat an ideology by force .
you have to fight ideas with ideas , " says abdul-rahman hadlaq , isu director .

ahmed shayea drove a massive truck bomb into the jordanian embassy in baghdad in august 2003 , killing nine people and injuring more than 60 .
it was the first major bombing carried out by the insurgency and was designed to announce al-qaeda 's arrival in iraq .
shayea survived the bombing and was held at the care centre after being repatriated from iraq by us forces .
" i am now an enemy of al-qaeda .
i believe god saved me to deliver this message , " says the former militant .
families are also heavily involved in the rehabilitation of their loved ones .
the authorities encourage them to make regular visits to the centre and inmates are allowed to make occasional visits home unescorted on the understanding that they will return later .
as muslim extremists , the inmates would have shunned representative art it is designed to prepare prisoners for their eventual release while building trust between them and the government .
it has proved particularly relevant for saudis being repatriated from the detention centre run by the us military at guantanamo bay .
after returning to the kingdom they are typically held at the care centre for a few months before being finally released .
" it prepared me to go back into society gradually .
you can not just go from guantanamo back to normal life .
it 's too difficult .
everything changed .
saudi arabia changed .
the whole world changed , " says juma muhammad dossari who spent six years in guantanamo bay .
" i have a great wife .
she tells me to forget guantanamo .
she says : ' just forget it ' .
she says : ' you 're a new man .
you have a new life .
you have your family .
focus on that . '
that makes me feel much better . "
financial arrangement ahmed shayea received major plastic surgery after surviving his bomb attack since its creation no-one from the care centre has reoffended .
but the support received by prisoners on their release suggests their reasons for maintaining good behaviour might not always reflect genuine ideological change .
graduates can typically expect the government to meet the cost of their wedding and have also enjoyed home refurbishments along with new cars .
it might sound alarming to outsiders , but most saudis are comfortable with the arrangement .
" as a -lsb- western -rsb- person you might question this - but when i put on my saudi hat , i think , it was the right decision " says khalid al-maeena , editor of the english-language arab news .
" we are a patriarchal society .
these people are sons of the soil .
when a son makes a mistake , the father forgives him and the king has pardoned them . "
the centre has only been open for 18 months and most of those currently passing through it are al-qaeda 's foot soldiers , not its ideologues .
convincing those people to change their minds might take a lot more than video games , pepsi and ping-pong .
shiraz maher 's report is broadcast on bbc two 's newsnight at 2230bst on wednesday 9 july .

the lawsuit seeks to halt inbev 's efforts to replace anheuser 's board .
inbev , best known for stella artois , is trying to pay $ 46bn -lrb- £ 23bn -rrb- for the budweiser brewer .
anheuser says inbev does not have solid financing and its cuban operations could complicate efforts to operate in the us .
according to the lawsuit , inbev operates the bucanero sa brewery in cuba , which could not be managed from the us under the trading with the enemy act .
anheuser questioned inbev 's claim that it would make anheuser 's hometown of st. louis its north american headquarters given its cuban presence .
if the takeover went ahead , the combined firm would become the world 's largest brewer .
anheuser-busch said the offer , made in june , had undervalued the company , but added that it was open to consider any proposals that would provide full value to its shareholders .

climate change is one of the great global challenges of our time .
conscious of our leadership role in meeting such challenges , we , the leaders of the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , commit to combat climate change in accordance with our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and confront the interlinked challenges of sustainable development , including energy and food security , and human health .
we have come together to contribute to efforts under the un framework convention on climate change , the global forum for climate negotiations .
our contribution and cooperation are rooted in the objective , provisions , and principles of the convention .
2 .
we welcome decisions taken by the international community in bali , including to launch a comprehensive process to enable the full , effective , and sustained implementation of the convention through long-term co-operative action , now , up to , and beyond 2012 , in order to reach an agreed outcome in december 2009 .
recognising the scale and urgency of the challenge , we will continue working together to strengthen implementation of the convention and to ensure that the agreed outcome maximises the efforts of all nations and contributes to achieving the ultimate objective in article 2 of the convention , which should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change , to ensure that food production is not threatened , and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner .
3 .
the major economies meetings constructively contribute to the bali process in several ways : first , our dialogue at political , policy , and technical levels has built confidence among our nations and deepened mutual understanding of the many challenges confronting the world community as we consider next steps under the convention and continue to mobilise political will to combat global climate change .
second , without prejudging outcomes or the views of other nations , we believe that the common understandings in this declaration will help advance the work of the international community so it is possible to reach an agreed outcome by the end of 2009 .
third , recognising the need for urgent action and the bali action plan 's directive for enhanced implementation of the convention between now and 2012 , we commit to taking the actions in paragraph 10 without delay .
4 .
we support a shared vision for long-term cooperative action , including a long-term global goal for emission reductions , that assures growth , prosperity , and other aspects of sustainable development , including major efforts towards sustainable consumption and production , all aimed at achieving a low carbon society .
taking account of the science , we recognise that deep cuts in global emissions will be necessary to achieve the convention 's ultimate objective , and that adaptation will play a correspondingly vital role .
we believe that it would be desirable for the parties to adopt in the negotiations under the convention a long-term global goal for reducing global emissions , taking into account the principle of equity .
we urge that serious consideration be given in particular to ambitious ipcc scenarios .
significant progress toward a long-term global goal will be made by increasing financing of the broad deployment of existing technologies and best practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resilience .
however , our ability ultimately to achieve a long-term global goal will also depend on affordable , new , more advanced , and innovative technologies , infrastructure , and practices that transform the way we live , produce and use energy , and manage land .
5 .
taking into account assessments of science , technology , and economics , we recognise the essential importance of enhanced greenhouse gas mitigation that is ambitious , realistic , and achievable .
we will do more .
we will continue to improve our policies and our performance while meeting other priority objectives , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities .
achieving our long-term global goal requires respective mid-term goals , commitments and actions , to be reflected in the agreed outcome of the bali action plan , taking into account differences in social and economic conditions , energy mix , demographics , and infrastructure among other factors , and the above ipcc scenarios .
in this regard , the developed major economies will implement , consistent with international obligations , economy-wide mid-term goals and take corresponding actions in order to achieve absolute emission reductions and , where applicable , first stop the growth of emissions as soon as possible , reflecting comparable efforts among them .
at the same time , the developing major economies will pursue , in the context of sustainable development , nationally appropriate mitigation actions , supported and enabled by technology , financing and capacity-building , with a view to achieving a deviation from business as usual emissions .
6 .
we recognise that actions to reduce emissions , including from deforestation and forest degradation , and to increase removals by sinks in the land use , land use change , and forestry sector , including cooperation on tackling forest fires , can make a contribution to stabilising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
these actions also reduce climate change impacts and can have significant co-benefits by maintaining multiple economic goods and ecological services .
our nations will continue to cooperate on capacity-building and demonstration activities ; on innovative solutions , including financing , to reduce emissions and increase removals by sinks ; and on methodological issues .
we also stress the need to improve forest-related governance and cooperative actions at all levels .
7 .
we recognise that adaptation is vital to addressing the effects of inevitable climate change and that the adverse impacts of climate change are likely to affect developing countries disproportionately .
we will work together in accordance with our convention commitments to strengthen the ability of developing countries , particularly the most vulnerable ones , to adapt to climate change .
this includes the development and dissemination of tools and methodologies to improve vulnerability and adaptation assessments , the integration of climate change adaptation into overall development strategies , increased implementation of adaptation strategies , increased emphasis on adaptation technologies , strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability , and consideration of means to stimulate investment and increased availability of financial and technical assistance .
8 .
we affirm the critical role of technology and the need for technological breakthroughs in meeting the interlinked global challenges of energy security and climate change .
in the near term , broader deployment of many existing technologies will be vital for both mitigation and adaptation .
in particular , energy conservation , energy efficiency , disaster reduction , and water and natural resource management technologies are important .
we will promote the uptake and use of such technologies including renewables , cleaner and low-carbon technologies , and , for those of us interested , nuclear power .
technology cooperation with and transfer to developing countries are also vital in this effort , as is promoting capacity building .
for the longer term , research , development , demonstration , deployment , and transfer of innovative technologies will be crucial , and we acknowledge the need to enhance our investment and collaboration in these areas .
mindful of the important role of a range of alternative energy technologies , we recognise , in particular , the need for research , development , and large-scale demonstration of and cooperation on carbon capture and storage .
we also note the value of technology roadmaps as tools to promote continuous investment and cooperation in clean energy research , development , demonstration , and deployment .
9 .
we recognise that tackling climate change will require greater mobilization of financial resources , both domestically and internationally .
there is an urgent need to scale up financial flows , particularly financial support to developing countries ; to create positive incentives for actions ; to finance the incremental costs of cleaner and low-carbon technologies ; to make more efficient use of funds directed toward climate change ; to realise the full potential of appropriate market mechanisms that can provide pricing signals and economic incentives to the private sector ; to promote public sector investment ; to create enabling environments that promote private investment that is commercially viable ; to develop innovative approaches ; and to lower costs by creating appropriate incentives for and reducing and eliminating obstacles to technology transfer relevant to both mitigation and adaptation .
10 .
to enable the full , effective , and sustained implementation of the convention between now and 2012 , we will : work together on mitigation-related technology cooperation strategies in specific economic sectors , promote the exchange of mitigation information and analysis on sectoral efficiency , the identification of national technology needs and voluntary , action-oriented international cooperation , and consider the role of cooperative sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions , consistent with the convention ; direct our trade officials responsible for wto issues to advance with a sense of urgency their discussions on issues relevant to promoting our cooperation on climate change ; accelerate enhanced action on technology development , transfer , financing , and capacity building to support mitigation and adaptation efforts ; support implementation of the nairobi work programme on impacts , vulnerability , and adaptation to climate change ; improve significantly energy efficiency , a low-cost way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security ; continue to promote actions under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer for the benefit of the global climate system ; and intensify our efforts without delay within existing fora to improve effective greenhouse gas measurement .
11 .
our nations will continue to work constructively together to promote the success of the copenhagen climate change conference in 2009 .

in particular , energy conservation , energy efficiency , disaster reduction , and water and natural resource management technologies are important .
we will promote the uptake and use of such technologies including renewables , cleaner and low-carbon technologies , and , for those of us interested , nuclear power .
technology cooperation with and transfer to developing countries are also vital in this effort , as is promoting capacity building .
for the longer term , research , development , demonstration , deployment , and transfer of innovative technologies will be crucial , and we acknowledge the need to enhance our investment and collaboration in these areas .
mindful of the important role of a range of alternative energy technologies , we recognise , in particular , the need for research , development , and large-scale demonstration of and cooperation on carbon capture and storage .
we also note the value of technology roadmaps as tools to promote continuous investment and cooperation in clean energy research , development , demonstration , and deployment .
9 .
we recognise that tackling climate change will require greater mobilization of financial resources , both domestically and internationally .
there is an urgent need to scale up financial flows , particularly financial support to developing countries ; to create positive incentives for actions ; to finance the incremental costs of cleaner and low-carbon technologies ; to make more efficient use of funds directed toward climate change ; to realise the full potential of appropriate market mechanisms that can provide pricing signals and economic incentives to the private sector ; to promote public sector investment ; to create enabling environments that promote private investment that is commercially viable ; to develop innovative approaches ; and to lower costs by creating appropriate incentives for and reducing and eliminating obstacles to technology transfer relevant to both mitigation and adaptation .
10 .
to enable the full , effective , and sustained implementation of the convention between now and 2012 , we will : work together on mitigation-related technology cooperation strategies in specific economic sectors , promote the exchange of mitigation information and analysis on sectoral efficiency , the identification of national technology needs and voluntary , action-oriented international cooperation , and consider the role of cooperative sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions , consistent with the convention ; direct our trade officials responsible for wto issues to advance with a sense of urgency their discussions on issues relevant to promoting our cooperation on climate change ; accelerate enhanced action on technology development , transfer , financing , and capacity building to support mitigation and adaptation efforts ; support implementation of the nairobi work programme on impacts , vulnerability , and adaptation to climate change ; improve significantly energy efficiency , a low-cost way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security ; continue to promote actions under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer for the benefit of the global climate system ; and intensify our efforts without delay within existing fora to improve effective greenhouse gas measurement .
11 .
our nations will continue to work constructively together to promote the success of the copenhagen climate change conference in 2009 .

climate change is one of the great global challenges of our time .
conscious of our leadership role in meeting such challenges , we , the leaders of the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , commit to combat climate change in accordance with our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and confront the interlinked challenges of sustainable development , including energy and food security , and human health .
we have come together to contribute to efforts under the un framework convention on climate change , the global forum for climate negotiations .
our contribution and cooperation are rooted in the objective , provisions , and principles of the convention .
2 .
we welcome decisions taken by the international community in bali , including to launch a comprehensive process to enable the full , effective , and sustained implementation of the convention through long-term co-operative action , now , up to , and beyond 2012 , in order to reach an agreed outcome in december 2009 .
recognising the scale and urgency of the challenge , we will continue working together to strengthen implementation of the convention and to ensure that the agreed outcome maximises the efforts of all nations and contributes to achieving the ultimate objective in article 2 of the convention , which should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change , to ensure that food production is not threatened , and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner .
3 .
the major economies meetings constructively contribute to the bali process in several ways : first , our dialogue at political , policy , and technical levels has built confidence among our nations and deepened mutual understanding of the many challenges confronting the world community as we consider next steps under the convention and continue to mobilise political will to combat global climate change .
second , without prejudging outcomes or the views of other nations , we believe that the common understandings in this declaration will help advance the work of the international community so it is possible to reach an agreed outcome by the end of 2009 .
third , recognising the need for urgent action and the bali action plan 's directive for enhanced implementation of the convention between now and 2012 , we commit to taking the actions in paragraph 10 without delay .
4 .
we support a shared vision for long-term cooperative action , including a long-term global goal for emission reductions , that assures growth , prosperity , and other aspects of sustainable development , including major efforts towards sustainable consumption and production , all aimed at achieving a low carbon society .
taking account of the science , we recognise that deep cuts in global emissions will be necessary to achieve the convention 's ultimate objective , and that adaptation will play a correspondingly vital role .
we believe that it would be desirable for the parties to adopt in the negotiations under the convention a long-term global goal for reducing global emissions , taking into account the principle of equity .
we urge that serious consideration be given in particular to ambitious ipcc scenarios .
significant progress toward a long-term global goal will be made by increasing financing of the broad deployment of existing technologies and best practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resilience .
however , our ability ultimately to achieve a long-term global goal will also depend on affordable , new , more advanced , and innovative technologies , infrastructure , and practices that transform the way we live , produce and use energy , and manage land .
5 .
taking into account assessments of science , technology , and economics , we recognise the essential importance of enhanced greenhouse gas mitigation that is ambitious , realistic , and achievable .
we will do more .
we will continue to improve our policies and our performance while meeting other priority objectives , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities .
achieving our long-term global goal requires respective mid-term goals , commitments and actions , to be reflected in the agreed outcome of the bali action plan , taking into account differences in social and economic conditions , energy mix , demographics , and infrastructure among other factors , and the above ipcc scenarios .
in this regard , the developed major economies will implement , consistent with international obligations , economy-wide mid-term goals and take corresponding actions in order to achieve absolute emission reductions and , where applicable , first stop the growth of emissions as soon as possible , reflecting comparable efforts among them .
at the same time , the developing major economies will pursue , in the context of sustainable development , nationally appropriate mitigation actions , supported and enabled by technology , financing and capacity-building , with a view to achieving a deviation from business as usual emissions .
6 .
we recognise that actions to reduce emissions , including from deforestation and forest degradation , and to increase removals by sinks in the land use , land use change , and forestry sector , including cooperation on tackling forest fires , can make a contribution to stabilising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
these actions also reduce climate change impacts and can have significant co-benefits by maintaining multiple economic goods and ecological services .
our nations will continue to cooperate on capacity-building and demonstration activities ; on innovative solutions , including financing , to reduce emissions and increase removals by sinks ; and on methodological issues .
we also stress the need to improve forest-related governance and cooperative actions at all levels .
7 .
we recognise that adaptation is vital to addressing the effects of inevitable climate change and that the adverse impacts of climate change are likely to affect developing countries disproportionately .
we will work together in accordance with our convention commitments to strengthen the ability of developing countries , particularly the most vulnerable ones , to adapt to climate change .
this includes the development and dissemination of tools and methodologies to improve vulnerability and adaptation assessments , the integration of climate change adaptation into overall development strategies , increased implementation of adaptation strategies , increased emphasis on adaptation technologies , strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability , and consideration of means to stimulate investment and increased availability of financial and technical assistance .
8 .
we affirm the critical role of technology and the need for technological breakthroughs in meeting the interlinked global challenges of energy security and climate change .

at the same time , the developing major economies will pursue , in the context of sustainable development , nationally appropriate mitigation actions , supported and enabled by technology , financing and capacity-building , with a view to achieving a deviation from business as usual emissions .
6 .
we recognise that actions to reduce emissions , including from deforestation and forest degradation , and to increase removals by sinks in the land use , land use change , and forestry sector , including cooperation on tackling forest fires , can make a contribution to stabilising greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
these actions also reduce climate change impacts and can have significant co-benefits by maintaining multiple economic goods and ecological services .
our nations will continue to cooperate on capacity-building and demonstration activities ; on innovative solutions , including financing , to reduce emissions and increase removals by sinks ; and on methodological issues .
we also stress the need to improve forest-related governance and cooperative actions at all levels .
7 .
we recognise that adaptation is vital to addressing the effects of inevitable climate change and that the adverse impacts of climate change are likely to affect developing countries disproportionately .
we will work together in accordance with our convention commitments to strengthen the ability of developing countries , particularly the most vulnerable ones , to adapt to climate change .
this includes the development and dissemination of tools and methodologies to improve vulnerability and adaptation assessments , the integration of climate change adaptation into overall development strategies , increased implementation of adaptation strategies , increased emphasis on adaptation technologies , strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability , and consideration of means to stimulate investment and increased availability of financial and technical assistance .
8 .
we affirm the critical role of technology and the need for technological breakthroughs in meeting the interlinked global challenges of energy security and climate change .
in the near term , broader deployment of many existing technologies will be vital for both mitigation and adaptation .
in particular , energy conservation , energy efficiency , disaster reduction , and water and natural resource management technologies are important .
we will promote the uptake and use of such technologies including renewables , cleaner and low-carbon technologies , and , for those of us interested , nuclear power .
technology cooperation with and transfer to developing countries are also vital in this effort , as is promoting capacity building .
for the longer term , research , development , demonstration , deployment , and transfer of innovative technologies will be crucial , and we acknowledge the need to enhance our investment and collaboration in these areas .
mindful of the important role of a range of alternative energy technologies , we recognise , in particular , the need for research , development , and large-scale demonstration of and cooperation on carbon capture and storage .
we also note the value of technology roadmaps as tools to promote continuous investment and cooperation in clean energy research , development , demonstration , and deployment .
9 .
we recognise that tackling climate change will require greater mobilization of financial resources , both domestically and internationally .
there is an urgent need to scale up financial flows , particularly financial support to developing countries ; to create positive incentives for actions ; to finance the incremental costs of cleaner and low-carbon technologies ; to make more efficient use of funds directed toward climate change ; to realise the full potential of appropriate market mechanisms that can provide pricing signals and economic incentives to the private sector ; to promote public sector investment ; to create enabling environments that promote private investment that is commercially viable ; to develop innovative approaches ; and to lower costs by creating appropriate incentives for and reducing and eliminating obstacles to technology transfer relevant to both mitigation and adaptation .
10 .
to enable the full , effective , and sustained implementation of the convention between now and 2012 , we will : work together on mitigation-related technology cooperation strategies in specific economic sectors , promote the exchange of mitigation information and analysis on sectoral efficiency , the identification of national technology needs and voluntary , action-oriented international cooperation , and consider the role of cooperative sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions , consistent with the convention ; direct our trade officials responsible for wto issues to advance with a sense of urgency their discussions on issues relevant to promoting our cooperation on climate change ; accelerate enhanced action on technology development , transfer , financing , and capacity building to support mitigation and adaptation efforts ; support implementation of the nairobi work programme on impacts , vulnerability , and adaptation to climate change ; improve significantly energy efficiency , a low-cost way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security ; continue to promote actions under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer for the benefit of the global climate system ; and intensify our efforts without delay within existing fora to improve effective greenhouse gas measurement .
11 .
our nations will continue to work constructively together to promote the success of the copenhagen climate change conference in 2009 .

climate change is one of the great global challenges of our time .
conscious of our leadership role in meeting such challenges , we , the leaders of the world 's major economies , both developed and developing , commit to combat climate change in accordance with our common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and confront the interlinked challenges of sustainable development , including energy and food security , and human health .
we have come together to contribute to efforts under the un framework convention on climate change , the global forum for climate negotiations .
our contribution and cooperation are rooted in the objective , provisions , and principles of the convention .
2 .
we welcome decisions taken by the international community in bali , including to launch a comprehensive process to enable the full , effective , and sustained implementation of the convention through long-term co-operative action , now , up to , and beyond 2012 , in order to reach an agreed outcome in december 2009 .
recognising the scale and urgency of the challenge , we will continue working together to strengthen implementation of the convention and to ensure that the agreed outcome maximises the efforts of all nations and contributes to achieving the ultimate objective in article 2 of the convention , which should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change , to ensure that food production is not threatened , and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner .
3 .
the major economies meetings constructively contribute to the bali process in several ways : first , our dialogue at political , policy , and technical levels has built confidence among our nations and deepened mutual understanding of the many challenges confronting the world community as we consider next steps under the convention and continue to mobilise political will to combat global climate change .
second , without prejudging outcomes or the views of other nations , we believe that the common understandings in this declaration will help advance the work of the international community so it is possible to reach an agreed outcome by the end of 2009 .
third , recognising the need for urgent action and the bali action plan 's directive for enhanced implementation of the convention between now and 2012 , we commit to taking the actions in paragraph 10 without delay .
4 .
we support a shared vision for long-term cooperative action , including a long-term global goal for emission reductions , that assures growth , prosperity , and other aspects of sustainable development , including major efforts towards sustainable consumption and production , all aimed at achieving a low carbon society .
taking account of the science , we recognise that deep cuts in global emissions will be necessary to achieve the convention 's ultimate objective , and that adaptation will play a correspondingly vital role .
we believe that it would be desirable for the parties to adopt in the negotiations under the convention a long-term global goal for reducing global emissions , taking into account the principle of equity .
we urge that serious consideration be given in particular to ambitious ipcc scenarios .
significant progress toward a long-term global goal will be made by increasing financing of the broad deployment of existing technologies and best practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build climate resilience .
however , our ability ultimately to achieve a long-term global goal will also depend on affordable , new , more advanced , and innovative technologies , infrastructure , and practices that transform the way we live , produce and use energy , and manage land .
5 .
taking into account assessments of science , technology , and economics , we recognise the essential importance of enhanced greenhouse gas mitigation that is ambitious , realistic , and achievable .
we will do more .
we will continue to improve our policies and our performance while meeting other priority objectives , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities .
achieving our long-term global goal requires respective mid-term goals , commitments and actions , to be reflected in the agreed outcome of the bali action plan , taking into account differences in social and economic conditions , energy mix , demographics , and infrastructure among other factors , and the above ipcc scenarios .
in this regard , the developed major economies will implement , consistent with international obligations , economy-wide mid-term goals and take corresponding actions in order to achieve absolute emission reductions and , where applicable , first stop the growth of emissions as soon as possible , reflecting comparable efforts among them .

mr osborne will argue that current government policies are unpopular and suggest that " instead of using sticks , we can use carrots " to boost recycling .
firms in the us have shown how to " make it pay to go green " , he will add .
in a speech to pressure group the green alliance , he will also say landfill tax rates would not fall under the tories .
" this will send a powerful signal to businesses and councils that innovative approaches ... are possible , " he will say .
' us solution ' environmental campaigners say british recycling rates are low compared with other european countries .
mr osborne will tell the green alliance that he has found his solution in the us , where , as in the uk , councils pay a tax on every tonne of rubbish they send to landfill .
he is expected to highlight some us companies which offer to cut the landfill tax bill by increasing recycling rates .
from the today programme recyclebank - making waste pay these firms use financial incentives to get the public on board - the more people recycle , the more they can earn - and then themselves earn a share of the savings in landfill tax payments to local authorities .
mr osborne will say : " instead of being fined for not recycling , households are actually being paid for their recycling .
" instead of using sticks , we can use carrots instead .
instead of punitive taxes , we can use financial incentives . "
in some communities , such schemes have increased the amount of household waste being recycled by more than 200 % , mr osborne will add .
" i want to see this innovative approach rolled out across the uk . "
work under way he will say the conservatives are working with the local government association , the mayor of london 's office and tory local authorities , such as windsor and maidenhead , in berkshire , to explore how such schemes might be implemented .
earlier this year , the government asked councils whether they were interested in running pilot projects which would reward recycling .
in 2004/5 , the most recent year for which comparable figures are available across the eu , the uk dumped more household waste into landfill than any other country in the european union - 22.6m tonnes .
in the same period , france sent around 12m tonnes to landfill , poland about 8.6m and germany about 7.3m.
