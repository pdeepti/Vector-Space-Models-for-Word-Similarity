trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some form of prostitution is legal in much of europe thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives .

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives .

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives .

that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .

yet as gas prices continue to climb , opposition leaders said that 's not enough . " we 've got to use every chance we have to save energy , " merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview published on sunday , april 27 . merkel , asked about rising energy and food prices , said that people need to think about various energy-saving measures including insulating buildings , using renewable energy , switching to energy-efficient appliances and buying cars that use less fuel . " it 's good for the climate and it 's good for our wallet , " merkel said . call for price cap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have already made the switch to save on gas as oil prices headed to record highs on monday of nearly of nearly $ 120 -lrb- 77 euros -rrb- per barrel , germany 's other parties called on merkel 's government to take concrete steps to reduce gas prices . politicians from the social democratic party , free democratic party and the left party said government intervention is needed to lower gas prices .
spd head heiko maas told the bild am sonntag newspaper that gas prices had reached the upper limit of what was reasonable and that it 's time for the government to cap prices . " the rip-off by energy companies must at last be stopped , " maas said .
" i would call on the chancellor to immediately make it clear whether the coalition will limit fuel , heating and gas prices . " in germany , consumers were paying 1.43 euros on monday per liter of unleaded gas and about 1.36 per liter for diesel . the fdp , a free-market liberal party , also called on the government to lower gas prices , but said it should be achieved through tax cuts .
two thirds of gas prices come from taxes , said party head guido westerwelle . " the government is the biggest profiteer from energy costs , " westerwelle said . germans unlikely to slow down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants strict co2 standards merkel 's government has not made any move to cap fuel prices .
nor has it been willing to tell germany 's notoriously speedy drivers to slow down .
merkel has refused to support speed limits which would improve fuel efficiency . it 's also unclear whether germans will buy more fuel-efficient cars despite rising gas prices .
germans remain extremely proud of cars made by companies such as audi , bmw , mercedes and porsche . these cars are often less fuel efficient than french , italian and japanese models . merkel 's support questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel continues to find support in germany merkel 's government has also been accused by environmental groups of backing down from earlier support for tough new european union regulations to limit co2 emissions .
merkel 's government is concerned that the new measures will particularly harm german companies , which produce many of the luxury cars that will not meet new fuel efficiency standards . germany accepts the need for legal curbs on car emissions , but it wants all categories of cars to cut their emissions , german officials say .
that would mean that smaller , cleaner vehicles produced by france and italy that already meet the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometer would have to further reduce emissions .
germany has also called for a phase-in of the mandatory system , which is supposed to start in 2012 . biodiesel issue not going away merkel also continues to come under heavy criticism for defending biofuels in the face of food shortages . " i , like the chancellor , am very much in favor of maintaining the goals for biofuels , " agriculture minister horst seehofer told the dpa news agency on monday in berlin . the levels were set " on good grounds " and remain the right way to go , seehofer said . greenpeace protested the government support for biofuels on monday , holding signs that said " bread instead of biofuel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 28.04.2008 eu says farm subsidies not behind food shortages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu aims to put more money into agrarian development over 40 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies .
are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .

it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.04.2008 inflation worries top european bank agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices are rising in europe the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- defended its decision to hold interest rates steady , saying the move will help control inflation , which the bank has made its top priority . controlling medium- and long-term inflation remains a top priority for the ecb , the central bank president jean-claude trichet said on monday , april 28 .
even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .

he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council .

" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "

yet as gas prices continue to climb , opposition leaders said that 's not enough . " we 've got to use every chance we have to save energy , " merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview published on sunday , april 27 . merkel , asked about rising energy and food prices , said that people need to think about various energy-saving measures including insulating buildings , using renewable energy , switching to energy-efficient appliances and buying cars that use less fuel . " it 's good for the climate and it 's good for our wallet , " merkel said . call for price cap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have already made the switch to save on gas as oil prices headed to record highs on monday of nearly of nearly $ 120 -lrb- 77 euros -rrb- per barrel , germany 's other parties called on merkel 's government to take concrete steps to reduce gas prices . politicians from the social democratic party , free democratic party and the left party said government intervention is needed to lower gas prices .
spd head heiko maas told the bild am sonntag newspaper that gas prices had reached the upper limit of what was reasonable and that it 's time for the government to cap prices . " the rip-off by energy companies must at last be stopped , " maas said .
" i would call on the chancellor to immediately make it clear whether the coalition will limit fuel , heating and gas prices . " in germany , consumers were paying 1.43 euros on monday per liter of unleaded gas and about 1.36 per liter for diesel . the fdp , a free-market liberal party , also called on the government to lower gas prices , but said it should be achieved through tax cuts .
two thirds of gas prices come from taxes , said party head guido westerwelle . " the government is the biggest profiteer from energy costs , " westerwelle said . germans unlikely to slow down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants strict co2 standards merkel 's government has not made any move to cap fuel prices .
nor has it been willing to tell germany 's notoriously speedy drivers to slow down .
merkel has refused to support speed limits which would improve fuel efficiency . it 's also unclear whether germans will buy more fuel-efficient cars despite rising gas prices .
germans remain extremely proud of cars made by companies such as audi , bmw , mercedes and porsche . these cars are often less fuel efficient than french , italian and japanese models . merkel 's support questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel continues to find support in germany merkel 's government has also been accused by environmental groups of backing down from earlier support for tough new european union regulations to limit co2 emissions .
merkel 's government is concerned that the new measures will particularly harm german companies , which produce many of the luxury cars that will not meet new fuel efficiency standards . germany accepts the need for legal curbs on car emissions , but it wants all categories of cars to cut their emissions , german officials say .
that would mean that smaller , cleaner vehicles produced by france and italy that already meet the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometer would have to further reduce emissions .
germany has also called for a phase-in of the mandatory system , which is supposed to start in 2012 . biodiesel issue not going away merkel also continues to come under heavy criticism for defending biofuels in the face of food shortages . " i , like the chancellor , am very much in favor of maintaining the goals for biofuels , " agriculture minister horst seehofer told the dpa news agency on monday in berlin . the levels were set " on good grounds " and remain the right way to go , seehofer said . greenpeace protested the government support for biofuels on monday , holding signs that said " bread instead of biofuel .

the father has since admitted to imprisoning and abusing his daughter . a 73-year-old austrian admitted on monday to having fathered seven children with his daughter whom he kept imprisoned in a dungeon for 24 years , while officials rejected any responsibility for the tragedy . josef f. , a retired electrical engineer from amstetten in eastern austria , confessed to having locked his daughter , elisabeth , 42 , in the basement in august 1984 , and to having abused and raped her repeatedly , authorities said at a press conference . " this crime is more or less solved , " provincial police chief franz pruchner said .
" this crime is unique in the criminal history of austria .
it is beyond all dimensions i know of .

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some form of prostitution is legal in much of europe thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 28.04.2008 europe reconsiders prostitution as sex trafficking booms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do customers care where the prostitutes come from and how they got there ?
trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives .

no thanks ! "
after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday . " a blast occurred around 2:15 a.m.
-lrb- 0015 gmt -rrb- in the center of leposavic , " a serb-populated town , police spokesman besim hoti told afp . hoti said an " explosive device , apparently a hand grenade , was thrown from a moving vehicle , " adding that an investigation was underway . the blast took place just hours after the start of the celebration of orthodox easter .
the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 28.04.2008 eu still seeking compromise on deals with serbia , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many serbs want to join the eu , but remain dismayed over kosovo 's independence top european union officials said on monday they still hoped to reach agreement on key deals with russia and serbia , but that the issues remained " difficult " ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . " today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .

following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .

yet as gas prices continue to climb , opposition leaders said that 's not enough . " we 've got to use every chance we have to save energy , " merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview published on sunday , april 27 . merkel , asked about rising energy and food prices , said that people need to think about various energy-saving measures including insulating buildings , using renewable energy , switching to energy-efficient appliances and buying cars that use less fuel .

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .
at that time , nine of 10 residents were ethnic germans , but nearly all of them were expelled from the region after world war ii . a man with two faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler saved jewish prisoners by placing their names on his personnel list fikejz said schindler did n't enjoy a particularly positive reputation .
he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "
following his death near frankfurt on oct .
9 , 1974 , schindler was buried , according to his own wishes , at the franciscan cemetery in jerusalem . his story remained relatively obscure until steven spielberg 's 1993 film " schindler 's list " put the factory-owner-turned-hero in the international spotlight . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .

he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "
following his death near frankfurt on oct .
9 , 1974 , schindler was buried , according to his own wishes , at the franciscan cemetery in jerusalem . his story remained relatively obscure until steven spielberg 's 1993 film " schindler 's list " put the factory-owner-turned-hero in the international spotlight . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 28.04.2008 eu still seeking compromise on deals with serbia , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many serbs want to join the eu , but remain dismayed over kosovo 's independence top european union officials said on monday they still hoped to reach agreement on key deals with russia and serbia , but that the issues remained " difficult " ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . " today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .

" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .
but he also knows he is onto a winner with a broad cross-section of the german electorate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no thanks ! "
after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday .

the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 28.04.2008 eu says farm subsidies not behind food shortages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu aims to put more money into agrarian development over 40 percent of the eu 's budget goes to agricultural subsidies .
are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .
1 , 2009 , if the eu member states manage to agree on a compromise by then . anke hagedorn -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .
but he also knows he is onto a winner with a broad cross-section of the german electorate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .

the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .
it played a crucial role in the 1948-49 allied airlift to save west berlin from being strangled by russian forces at the start of the cold war .
the facility only served 630,000 passengers in 2006 , compared to 12 million for tegel airport on the city 's northwestern fringe , and 6 million at schoenefeld to the southeast .
when tempelhof and tegel are closed , the expanded and modernized schoenefeld facility is to become the capital 's sole airport . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .
at that time , nine of 10 residents were ethnic germans , but nearly all of them were expelled from the region after world war ii . a man with two faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler saved jewish prisoners by placing their names on his personnel list fikejz said schindler did n't enjoy a particularly positive reputation .
he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "
following his death near frankfurt on oct .
9 , 1974 , schindler was buried , according to his own wishes , at the franciscan cemetery in jerusalem . his story remained relatively obscure until steven spielberg 's 1993 film " schindler 's list " put the factory-owner-turned-hero in the international spotlight . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .
it played a crucial role in the 1948-49 allied airlift to save west berlin from being strangled by russian forces at the start of the cold war .
the facility only served 630,000 passengers in 2006 , compared to 12 million for tegel airport on the city 's northwestern fringe , and 6 million at schoenefeld to the southeast .
when tempelhof and tegel are closed , the expanded and modernized schoenefeld facility is to become the capital 's sole airport . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet as gas prices continue to climb , opposition leaders said that 's not enough . " we 've got to use every chance we have to save energy , " merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview published on sunday , april 27 . merkel , asked about rising energy and food prices , said that people need to think about various energy-saving measures including insulating buildings , using renewable energy , switching to energy-efficient appliances and buying cars that use less fuel . " it 's good for the climate and it 's good for our wallet , " merkel said . call for price cap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have already made the switch to save on gas as oil prices headed to record highs on monday of nearly of nearly $ 120 -lrb- 77 euros -rrb- per barrel , germany 's other parties called on merkel 's government to take concrete steps to reduce gas prices . politicians from the social democratic party , free democratic party and the left party said government intervention is needed to lower gas prices .
spd head heiko maas told the bild am sonntag newspaper that gas prices had reached the upper limit of what was reasonable and that it 's time for the government to cap prices . " the rip-off by energy companies must at last be stopped , " maas said .
" i would call on the chancellor to immediately make it clear whether the coalition will limit fuel , heating and gas prices . " in germany , consumers were paying 1.43 euros on monday per liter of unleaded gas and about 1.36 per liter for diesel . the fdp , a free-market liberal party , also called on the government to lower gas prices , but said it should be achieved through tax cuts .
two thirds of gas prices come from taxes , said party head guido westerwelle . " the government is the biggest profiteer from energy costs , " westerwelle said . germans unlikely to slow down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants strict co2 standards merkel 's government has not made any move to cap fuel prices .
nor has it been willing to tell germany 's notoriously speedy drivers to slow down .
merkel has refused to support speed limits which would improve fuel efficiency . it 's also unclear whether germans will buy more fuel-efficient cars despite rising gas prices .
germans remain extremely proud of cars made by companies such as audi , bmw , mercedes and porsche . these cars are often less fuel efficient than french , italian and japanese models . merkel 's support questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel continues to find support in germany merkel 's government has also been accused by environmental groups of backing down from earlier support for tough new european union regulations to limit co2 emissions .
merkel 's government is concerned that the new measures will particularly harm german companies , which produce many of the luxury cars that will not meet new fuel efficiency standards . germany accepts the need for legal curbs on car emissions , but it wants all categories of cars to cut their emissions , german officials say .
that would mean that smaller , cleaner vehicles produced by france and italy that already meet the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometer would have to further reduce emissions .
germany has also called for a phase-in of the mandatory system , which is supposed to start in 2012 . biodiesel issue not going away merkel also continues to come under heavy criticism for defending biofuels in the face of food shortages . " i , like the chancellor , am very much in favor of maintaining the goals for biofuels , " agriculture minister horst seehofer told the dpa news agency on monday in berlin . the levels were set " on good grounds " and remain the right way to go , seehofer said . greenpeace protested the government support for biofuels on monday , holding signs that said " bread instead of biofuel .

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some form of prostitution is legal in much of europe thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no thanks ! "
after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday . " a blast occurred around 2:15 a.m.
-lrb- 0015 gmt -rrb- in the center of leposavic , " a serb-populated town , police spokesman besim hoti told afp . hoti said an " explosive device , apparently a hand grenade , was thrown from a moving vehicle , " adding that an investigation was underway . the blast took place just hours after the start of the celebration of orthodox easter .
the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .
1 , 2009 , if the eu member states manage to agree on a compromise by then . anke hagedorn -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .
it played a crucial role in the 1948-49 allied airlift to save west berlin from being strangled by russian forces at the start of the cold war .
the facility only served 630,000 passengers in 2006 , compared to 12 million for tegel airport on the city 's northwestern fringe , and 6 million at schoenefeld to the southeast .
when tempelhof and tegel are closed , the expanded and modernized schoenefeld facility is to become the capital 's sole airport . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .
it played a crucial role in the 1948-49 allied airlift to save west berlin from being strangled by russian forces at the start of the cold war .
the facility only served 630,000 passengers in 2006 , compared to 12 million for tegel airport on the city 's northwestern fringe , and 6 million at schoenefeld to the southeast .
when tempelhof and tegel are closed , the expanded and modernized schoenefeld facility is to become the capital 's sole airport . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday .

the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet as gas prices continue to climb , opposition leaders said that 's not enough . " we 've got to use every chance we have to save energy , " merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview published on sunday , april 27 . merkel , asked about rising energy and food prices , said that people need to think about various energy-saving measures including insulating buildings , using renewable energy , switching to energy-efficient appliances and buying cars that use less fuel . " it 's good for the climate and it 's good for our wallet , " merkel said . call for price cap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have already made the switch to save on gas as oil prices headed to record highs on monday of nearly of nearly $ 120 -lrb- 77 euros -rrb- per barrel , germany 's other parties called on merkel 's government to take concrete steps to reduce gas prices . politicians from the social democratic party , free democratic party and the left party said government intervention is needed to lower gas prices .
spd head heiko maas told the bild am sonntag newspaper that gas prices had reached the upper limit of what was reasonable and that it 's time for the government to cap prices . " the rip-off by energy companies must at last be stopped , " maas said .
" i would call on the chancellor to immediately make it clear whether the coalition will limit fuel , heating and gas prices . " in germany , consumers were paying 1.43 euros on monday per liter of unleaded gas and about 1.36 per liter for diesel . the fdp , a free-market liberal party , also called on the government to lower gas prices , but said it should be achieved through tax cuts .

nor has it been willing to tell germany 's notoriously speedy drivers to slow down .
merkel has refused to support speed limits which would improve fuel efficiency . it 's also unclear whether germans will buy more fuel-efficient cars despite rising gas prices .
germans remain extremely proud of cars made by companies such as audi , bmw , mercedes and porsche . these cars are often less fuel efficient than french , italian and japanese models . merkel 's support questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel continues to find support in germany merkel 's government has also been accused by environmental groups of backing down from earlier support for tough new european union regulations to limit co2 emissions .
merkel 's government is concerned that the new measures will particularly harm german companies , which produce many of the luxury cars that will not meet new fuel efficiency standards . germany accepts the need for legal curbs on car emissions , but it wants all categories of cars to cut their emissions , german officials say .
that would mean that smaller , cleaner vehicles produced by france and italy that already meet the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometer would have to further reduce emissions .
germany has also called for a phase-in of the mandatory system , which is supposed to start in 2012 . biodiesel issue not going away merkel also continues to come under heavy criticism for defending biofuels in the face of food shortages .

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .
1 , 2009 , if the eu member states manage to agree on a compromise by then . anke hagedorn -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .
it played a crucial role in the 1948-49 allied airlift to save west berlin from being strangled by russian forces at the start of the cold war .
the facility only served 630,000 passengers in 2006 , compared to 12 million for tegel airport on the city 's northwestern fringe , and 6 million at schoenefeld to the southeast .
when tempelhof and tegel are closed , the expanded and modernized schoenefeld facility is to become the capital 's sole airport . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday .

the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "

the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .

gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de interior affairs -pipe- 28.04.2008 germany 's social democrats have fat cat salaries in their sight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fat cat executives have a new enemy - the country 's social democrats germany 's social democrats are taking aim at soaring executive pay , staking out a clear position on a popular theme ahead of elections next year and drawing criticism from other parties . " all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .
but he also knows he is onto a winner with a broad cross-section of the german electorate . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .

after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday . " a blast occurred around 2:15 a.m.
-lrb- 0015 gmt -rrb- in the center of leposavic , " a serb-populated town , police spokesman besim hoti told afp . hoti said an " explosive device , apparently a hand grenade , was thrown from a moving vehicle , " adding that an investigation was underway . the blast took place just hours after the start of the celebration of orthodox easter .
the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 28.04.2008 eu still seeking compromise on deals with serbia , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many serbs want to join the eu , but remain dismayed over kosovo 's independence top european union officials said on monday they still hoped to reach agreement on key deals with russia and serbia , but that the issues remained " difficult " ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . " today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .
at that time , nine of 10 residents were ethnic germans , but nearly all of them were expelled from the region after world war ii . a man with two faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler saved jewish prisoners by placing their names on his personnel list fikejz said schindler did n't enjoy a particularly positive reputation .
he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "

divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .
at that time , nine of 10 residents were ethnic germans , but nearly all of them were expelled from the region after world war ii . a man with two faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler saved jewish prisoners by placing their names on his personnel list fikejz said schindler did n't enjoy a particularly positive reputation .
he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "
following his death near frankfurt on oct .
9 , 1974 , schindler was buried , according to his own wishes , at the franciscan cemetery in jerusalem . his story remained relatively obscure until steven spielberg 's 1993 film " schindler 's list " put the factory-owner-turned-hero in the international spotlight . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.04.2008 inflation worries top european bank agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices are rising in europe the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- defended its decision to hold interest rates steady , saying the move will help control inflation , which the bank has made its top priority . controlling medium- and long-term inflation remains a top priority for the ecb , the central bank president jean-claude trichet said on monday , april 28 .
even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .

he met his counterpart pervez musharraf and prime minister yousaf raza gilani for talks , which focussed largely on plans for a pipeline from iran to pakistan and india , which is to be over 2,500 kilometres long and will carry natural gas from iran to the indian subcontinent . president ahmadinejad flew into chaklala airbase in rawalpindi , a garrison town not far from the capital islamabad , where he was met by the pakistani minister for water and power , as well as other officials and an air force honour guard .
he was later received by his pakistani counterpart , pervez musharraf , at the presidential palace .
top of the agenda was the multi-million dollar iran-pakistan-india gas pipeline .
the two presidents cleared the final hurdles and gave their foreign ministers the task of coming to an agreement about a mutually convenient date .
professor pervez iqbar cheema , a political expert based in islamabad , was sure it would not take long now : “ i think the agreement on this iran-pakistan-india pipeline will be finalised within weeks .
the mechanism is already in place .
reportedly , iran has already started laying the pipeline on its territory . ”
but officially , work on the pipeline is expected to start in 2009 .
stalled talks the project was tabled in 1994 but talks stalled because of tension between india and pakistan over transit fees .
however , the current energy crisis and spiralling oil prices brought the two sides back to the negotiating table .
last week , india ’ s oil minister murli deora said during a visit to islamabad that the two sides had agreed to the project in principle .
while his pakistani counterpart , khwaja muhammad asif , told the media that the project would be beneficial to both sides .
talks about the pipeline were also delayed by washington ’ s aversion to it .
us officials have warned it could be detrimental to efforts to isolate iran over its nuclear energy programme .
reportedly , washington has tried to apply pressure on india to opt out of the project .
but india is booming and in urgent need of energy supplies - it imports 70 percent of its energy needs and wants to secure them .
iran insists its controversial programme is only for energy purposes .
nuclear-armed pakistan supports this stance , saying tehran has a right to peaceful nuclear technology .
peace is also the aim of the pipeline , the pakistani and iranian presidents said on monday before turning to other matters .
electricity and regional stability after their meeting , pakistan ’ s foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi spoke to reporters : “ this pipeline will promote peace and friendship .
iran has also decided to export electricity to pakistan ; so far pakistan takes only 35 megawatts of electricity from iran but the plan is to import 1,100 megawatts . ”
the electricity from iran will help pakistan to meet its growing energy demands and reduce recurring power outages - especially on its south-western coast .
ahmadinejad and musharraf also discussed regional security , especially in afghanistan , saying that peace there was vital for ensuring stability .
the iranian president held a separate meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gilani to discuss bilateral economic ties .
they agreed to focus more on trade and develop the regional economy in the future .
ahmadinejad ’ s next stop on his whistle-stop tour of south asia is sri lanka .
on tuesday , he is due in india .
india has already reportedly rebuked a us official who said new delhi should urge ahmadinejad to curtail his nuclear programme when he visits . anne thomas 28/04/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic gas pipeline will bring " peace and friendship " say iran and pakistan 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .
at that time , nine of 10 residents were ethnic germans , but nearly all of them were expelled from the region after world war ii . a man with two faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler saved jewish prisoners by placing their names on his personnel list fikejz said schindler did n't enjoy a particularly positive reputation .
he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "
following his death near frankfurt on oct .
9 , 1974 , schindler was buried , according to his own wishes , at the franciscan cemetery in jerusalem . his story remained relatively obscure until steven spielberg 's 1993 film " schindler 's list " put the factory-owner-turned-hero in the international spotlight . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .
1 , 2009 , if the eu member states manage to agree on a compromise by then . anke hagedorn -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .
at that time , nine of 10 residents were ethnic germans , but nearly all of them were expelled from the region after world war ii . a man with two faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler saved jewish prisoners by placing their names on his personnel list fikejz said schindler did n't enjoy a particularly positive reputation .
he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "
following his death near frankfurt on oct .
9 , 1974 , schindler was buried , according to his own wishes , at the franciscan cemetery in jerusalem . his story remained relatively obscure until steven spielberg 's 1993 film " schindler 's list " put the factory-owner-turned-hero in the international spotlight . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet as gas prices continue to climb , opposition leaders said that 's not enough . " we 've got to use every chance we have to save energy , " merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview published on sunday , april 27 . merkel , asked about rising energy and food prices , said that people need to think about various energy-saving measures including insulating buildings , using renewable energy , switching to energy-efficient appliances and buying cars that use less fuel . " it 's good for the climate and it 's good for our wallet , " merkel said . call for price cap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have already made the switch to save on gas as oil prices headed to record highs on monday of nearly of nearly $ 120 -lrb- 77 euros -rrb- per barrel , germany 's other parties called on merkel 's government to take concrete steps to reduce gas prices . politicians from the social democratic party , free democratic party and the left party said government intervention is needed to lower gas prices .
spd head heiko maas told the bild am sonntag newspaper that gas prices had reached the upper limit of what was reasonable and that it 's time for the government to cap prices . " the rip-off by energy companies must at last be stopped , " maas said .
" i would call on the chancellor to immediately make it clear whether the coalition will limit fuel , heating and gas prices . " in germany , consumers were paying 1.43 euros on monday per liter of unleaded gas and about 1.36 per liter for diesel . the fdp , a free-market liberal party , also called on the government to lower gas prices , but said it should be achieved through tax cuts .
two thirds of gas prices come from taxes , said party head guido westerwelle . " the government is the biggest profiteer from energy costs , " westerwelle said . germans unlikely to slow down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants strict co2 standards merkel 's government has not made any move to cap fuel prices .
nor has it been willing to tell germany 's notoriously speedy drivers to slow down .
merkel has refused to support speed limits which would improve fuel efficiency . it 's also unclear whether germans will buy more fuel-efficient cars despite rising gas prices .
germans remain extremely proud of cars made by companies such as audi , bmw , mercedes and porsche . these cars are often less fuel efficient than french , italian and japanese models . merkel 's support questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel continues to find support in germany merkel 's government has also been accused by environmental groups of backing down from earlier support for tough new european union regulations to limit co2 emissions .
merkel 's government is concerned that the new measures will particularly harm german companies , which produce many of the luxury cars that will not meet new fuel efficiency standards . germany accepts the need for legal curbs on car emissions , but it wants all categories of cars to cut their emissions , german officials say .
that would mean that smaller , cleaner vehicles produced by france and italy that already meet the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometer would have to further reduce emissions .
germany has also called for a phase-in of the mandatory system , which is supposed to start in 2012 . biodiesel issue not going away merkel also continues to come under heavy criticism for defending biofuels in the face of food shortages . " i , like the chancellor , am very much in favor of maintaining the goals for biofuels , " agriculture minister horst seehofer told the dpa news agency on monday in berlin . the levels were set " on good grounds " and remain the right way to go , seehofer said . greenpeace protested the government support for biofuels on monday , holding signs that said " bread instead of biofuel .

the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .

the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .

in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . # b # " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives . " we have to create more possibilities for education there and improve the overall living situation for the women , " she said . sabine ripperger / dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no thanks ! "
after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday . " a blast occurred around 2:15 a.m.
-lrb- 0015 gmt -rrb- in the center of leposavic , " a serb-populated town , police spokesman besim hoti told afp . hoti said an " explosive device , apparently a hand grenade , was thrown from a moving vehicle , " adding that an investigation was underway . the blast took place just hours after the start of the celebration of orthodox easter .
the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trafficking and forced prostitution are on the rise , and the eu countries ' complicated prostitution laws make prosecution difficult .
an aid organization has opened its 12th office in germany to advise women in need . some 700,000 women are trafficked to western europe every year , said lawyer birgit thoma , who works for solwodi , or solidarity with women in distress . affordable transport and instant communication have led to an increase in trafficking over past 10 years , with the trade now worth an estimated $ 30 billion -lrb- 18.8 billion euros -rrb- globally , according to a united nations report . for many years the focus was on human trafficking from eastern europe , but when the eu expanded - mainly to the east and south - in 2004 , the legal status of women in the new member states changed .
that 's led solwodi to shift its focuses to african women who are forced into prostitution in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some form of prostitution is legal in much of europe thoma said foreigners make up some 70 percent of people in germany 's sex trade .
while exact figures are n't available , she estimated that about 100,000 women from nigeria alone have been trafficked to western europe . women victimize women unlike tactics used in eastern europe , african women are often lured with marriage deals .
the traffickers do n't belong to large mafia gangs , but are organized in smaller , inconspicuous networks . " often the criminals are women , " said thoma .
" these are the so-called ' mesdames , ' most of whom used to be victims themselves . " voodoo rituals are often used to scare and psychologically intimidate the women , she added . " priests force them not to say where they 're going and what happens to them , " thoma said .
" otherwise something will happen not only to their families , but sickness , death or curses will come over them too . " in 1985 , the catholic nun lea ackermann founded solwodi in kenya to assist women whose financial desperation had led to a life of prostitution .
three years later , the first solwodi branch was founded in germany as a refuge for foreign women who had become victims of forced prostitution or trafficking . europe revises legal framework prostitution is legal in germany , which creates obstacles to uncovering and prosecuting cases of trafficking .
since around 30 percent of trafficked women were aware beforehand that they would end up working in the sex trade , it is difficult to collect evidence proving they were forced into prostitution , thoma said . however , forced prostitution was redefined in 2005 when eu standards were applied to german law .
as a result , human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation is no longer a sex crime but a " crime against physical integrity and against freedom , " thoma explained . she added that the law 's inclusion of robbing people of their freedom was a better description of forced prostitution than labeling it a sex crime . germany is not alone in rethinking its laws surrounding prostitution .
sweden was the first in europe to outlaw paying for sex in 1999 .
last week , norway 's government proposed to fine or jail clients of prostitutes for up to six months in an effort to counteract trafficking and lower demand . in britain , where paid sex is legal but prostitutes are n't allowed to solicit in public , a group of labour mps have advocated for replacing criminal penalties for street prostitutes with mandatory counseling programs to get them out of the business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to prove that the trafficked women are forced into sex against their will " we do n't criminalize people who sell kidneys , we criminalize the buyer , " labour mp fiona mactaggart told reuters news agency . address the problem at its roots the justice system also makes it difficult prosecute traffickers who force women into marriage .
victims of this crime have to prove that they suffered threats or abuse - not only that they forced to marry against their will .
these women also risk penalties if they are shown to have married only to acquire a residence permit . for those without residence permits , a new law in germany aims to encourage them to testify against their traffickers .
after the initial three-month tourist visa , trafficking victims are granted an additional six months to consider whether to press charges . " if they do n't testify , they 're deported , " said thoma .
" but if they testify , they get a residence permit for the duration of the criminal proceedings . " but ultimately , trafficking needs to be addressed from the bottom up , said the lawyer .
that means pulling the women out of poverty and offering them a chance to improve their lives .

oskar schindler still divides großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler remained relatively obscur until the hollywood film about him the man who saved the lives of 1,200 jews during the holocaust would have turned 100 on april 28 , 2008 .
the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that . " there 's a minority that says , ' he was a nazi , a spy , a sudeten german and a member of the nsdap , the party that destroyed the republic , " city historian radoslav fikejz , who prepared the exhibit , told german broadcaster hessischer rundfunk . schindler was born in 1908 in svitavy , known then as zwittau , as the son of a farm machine manufacturer .
at that time , nine of 10 residents were ethnic germans , but nearly all of them were expelled from the region after world war ii . a man with two faces bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schindler saved jewish prisoners by placing their names on his personnel list fikejz said schindler did n't enjoy a particularly positive reputation .
he was known as an opportunist , a spy and a playboy . in 1924 he was dismissed from school for falsifying his report card .
he seemed more interested in beautiful women and fast cars than education . having failed as an entrepreneur , he joined hitler 's counter-intelligence corps to spy on czechoslovakians .
in 1939 he was arrested by the czechoslovakian police and sentenced to death , but avoided execution because the german troops invaded the country shortly after . that same year he purchased a bankrupt porcelain factory in krakow , poland , and began producing tableware for the german soldiers .
as his business prospered , he took on more and more forced jewish laborers . a natural businessman , schindler maintained positive relations with the nazis .
when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council . " i think it would be good if people here would say , ' yeah , he was one of us , he was our fellow citizen , " ' said fikejz .
" but the older generation only knows a simplified version of the story . " nevertheless , more and more people in the czech town are starting to see schindler as someone who rescued the jews , he added - a change he hopes to encourage with the exhibit . although schindler 's former neighbors are divided as how to remember him , the jews he rescued faithfully supported him over the years .
in 1963 they opened a fund to offer him financial assistance when he returned to germany after his nutria farm failed in argentina . in 1967 , he was honored at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem as " righteous among the nations . "
following his death near frankfurt on oct .
9 , 1974 , schindler was buried , according to his own wishes , at the franciscan cemetery in jerusalem . his story remained relatively obscure until steven spielberg 's 1993 film " schindler 's list " put the factory-owner-turned-hero in the international spotlight . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
the remaining measures will be introduced on jan .
1 , 2009 , if the eu member states manage to agree on a compromise by then . anke hagedorn -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 28.04.2008 eu still seeking compromise on deals with serbia , russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many serbs want to join the eu , but remain dismayed over kosovo 's independence top european union officials said on monday they still hoped to reach agreement on key deals with russia and serbia , but that the issues remained " difficult " ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in luxembourg . " today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .

" all sense of proportion has gone out of the window with management pay in recent years , " the social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- national chairman kurt beck said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck wants to help the spd 's profile ahead of parliamentary elections beck is keen to put clear water between his party and chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before parliamentary elections that must be held by september next year .
the spd , the junior partner in the governing coalition , has put forward the idea of capping the amount that companies can set off against tax at 1 million euros -lrb- $ 1.6 million -rrb- per executive .
spd finance minister peer steinbrueck , who generally takes a pro-business line , backed his party 's proposals as " an important signal on how one should deal socially with ongoing pay and severance package excesses . "
distaste at this excess is widely felt .
merkel herself has condemned executive pay packages .
as the discussion gathered steam , the chancellor 's spokesman said on monday that merkel had made clear repeatedly in the past that there was " little comprehension " for managers departing with large severance packages after their companies had shown a loss .
but merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister-party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , tended to the view that this problem was for boards of management to clear up and not for the politicians , he said .
csu leader accuse spd of bowing to leftist pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erwin huber criticized the motives of the spd erwin huber , the csu chief and bavarian minister of finance , has rejected the spd 's plan , saying that it is " politically and ideologically motivated " and that , according to the tax laws of germany , implementation of the plan would be " very problematic . "
huber added that he believed that the attack on executive pay by the spd hierarchy was driven by " a fear of the leftists " in the party .
the minority liberal fdp , currently in opposition but hoping that next september 's election arithmetic could see it in power alongside the cdu / csu , takes an even more strongly free-market line .
the spd 's proposals were " in principle anti-market , " fdp general secretary dirk niebel told national public television .
the fdp party is fond of pointing out that 10 percent of german taxpayers - those earning 66,000 euros and more - pay 50 percent of all income tax .
opponents on the left take this statistic as an indication of how skewed german pay is .
pay divide becoming an election issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance is weighted in favor of the rich and powerful a survey earlier this year by the berlin-based diw economic research institute found that the pay divide was widening rapidly .
simultaneously , the middle class had undergone an alarming decline , from around 62 percent of the population in 1992 to 54 percent just 14 years later , the publicly funded institute said .
in response , germany 's trade union movement is showing increased militancy after years of wage restraint at the behest of politicians , like steinbrueck , who were worried about the public finances .
beck knows of the rising angst in the broader middle class at the growing gap between rich and poor .
he is also well aware that the spd proposal on executive pay is a non-starter with the current government and that tax experts see problems in implementing it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sixtieth anniversary of the berlin airlift 60th anniversary berlin airlift the berlin airlift was america 's finest hour 60 years ago the berlin airlift in numbers us , germany celebrate 60 years of berlin airlift berlin -pipe- 28.04.2008 bid to save berlin 's iconic tempelhof airport fails großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of tempelhof campaigned long and hard but lost the public vote on its future a referendum on keeping berlin 's iconic tempelhof airport open has failed to gain the necessary support . the vote , conducted in the german capital sunday , april 27 , secured the support of 21 percent of the city 's electorate , against the 25 percent needed for it to be valid .
the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .
it played a crucial role in the 1948-49 allied airlift to save west berlin from being strangled by russian forces at the start of the cold war .
the facility only served 630,000 passengers in 2006 , compared to 12 million for tegel airport on the city 's northwestern fringe , and 6 million at schoenefeld to the southeast .
when tempelhof and tegel are closed , the expanded and modernized schoenefeld facility is to become the capital 's sole airport . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nonbinding vote had been pushed through by tempelhof supporters . berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the airport would close , as planned , at the end of october .
wowereit had been a vocal opponent of the effort to keep the airport open and called on berliners to accept the vote 's outcome . wowereit 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and their left party coalition partners mounted an energetic last-minute campaign against retaining the airport , characterizing it as " elitist . " the opposition christian democratic union head friedbert pflueger pointed out that the spd had always said that the tempelhof vote was not binding .
but wowereit should not forget that 100,000 people voted to keep the airport open than had voted for wowereit in the last election , pflueger told the n24 television station on monday .
city center location a problem , say critics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tempelhof lies at the very heart of the german capital others who have called for its closure say tempelhof 's central location is a nuisance for residents and a security risk due to low-flying planes in a heavily populated area .
they have suggested the creation of a cultural and media center in its terminal and a park to replace its runways .
tempelhof , adolph hitler 's showpiece airport built in the 1930s , is said to be the third-largest building complex in the world .
it played a crucial role in the 1948-49 allied airlift to save west berlin from being strangled by russian forces at the start of the cold war .
the facility only served 630,000 passengers in 2006 , compared to 12 million for tegel airport on the city 's northwestern fringe , and 6 million at schoenefeld to the southeast .
when tempelhof and tegel are closed , the expanded and modernized schoenefeld facility is to become the capital 's sole airport . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda / th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no thanks ! "
after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday . " a blast occurred around 2:15 a.m.
-lrb- 0015 gmt -rrb- in the center of leposavic , " a serb-populated town , police spokesman besim hoti told afp . hoti said an " explosive device , apparently a hand grenade , was thrown from a moving vehicle , " adding that an investigation was underway . the blast took place just hours after the start of the celebration of orthodox easter .
the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .
also on tuesday , they are expected to call for the signature of an saa with bosnia-herzegovina as soon as it has been translated into all 23 eu languages . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the subject of a 1993 hollywood film , oskar schindler remains controversial for some . in germany , a special edition postal stamp has been issued in honor of oskar schindler 's 100th birthday .
but in his home town of svitavy , in what is today the czech republic , there is resistance to memorializing what some remember as a " nazi " and a " spy . " a new exhibit , set to open on tuesday , april 29 , aims to change that .

when the russian army approached krakow , he was able to convince the nazis that it was crucial to their war effort to relocate the factory to brnenec in what is now the czech republic . schindler spared some 1,200 jewish laborers from deportation by adding them to his personnel lists , ensuring that they joined him in brnenec instead of landing on a train to auschwitz . awareness growing in hometown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some czechs are beginning to change their opinions regarding schindler a monument to schindler was erected in front of his parents ' house in svitavy after a long conflict and much resistance , particularly from the communists in the city council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 28.04.2008 inflation worries top european bank agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prices are rising in europe the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- defended its decision to hold interest rates steady , saying the move will help control inflation , which the bank has made its top priority . controlling medium- and long-term inflation remains a top priority for the ecb , the central bank president jean-claude trichet said on monday , april 28 .
even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .

even as record inflation has spread across the 15 countries which share the euro , the ecb has held interest rates at 4 percent .
as of march , annual consumer prices jumped 3.6 percent in the euro zone due to higher energy and food prices .
this is well above the ecb 's 2 percent annual inflation target .
" we on the ecb 's governing council believe that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving our goal of medium-term price stability and to anchoring medium- and long-term inflation expectations on a lasting basis , " trichet told a congress organized by the austrian central bank , oenb .
safeguarding price stability was necessary for economic growth , job creation and social cohesion , the ecb chief told the conference , which was organized to discuss the first decade of europe 's common currency .
eu strategy differs from us , britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet is thinking long term trichet , along with other leading ecb members , has indicated that the frankfurt-based bank has no plans to follow the lead of other major central banks in slashing borrowing costs in an attempt to prevent an economic downturn .
the ecb president described the current economic situation as " very challenging " but said he was convinced that europe can " meet those challenges thanks to its stability-orientated monetary policy strategy . "
both the united states federal reserve and the bank of england have made interest rate cuts in response to global economic and financial market turmoil triggered by the us subprime mortgage market crisis .
german consumer confidence rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers saw reasons for optimism meanwhile , germany saw a bump in its consumer confidence , but inflation could hurt long-term gains , experts said .
the widely-watched gfk consumer confidence index climbed to 5.9 points from 4.8 points in march .
the poll looked at spending plans , personal income and the economic outlook , all three of which showed improvement in the survey , the results of which were released on monday .
decreasing unemployment and substantial pay raises were seen as a reason for the bump .
" the first important wage settlements of this year , which brought employees markedly higher wage increases than in previous years , apparently improved sentiment among german consumers despite the increasing headwind for the german economy , " economist alexander koch at unicredit markets told afp news agency .
the gfk said controlling inflation would be necessary for long-term consumer confidence .
koch agreed , saying that the upswing was unlikely to signal the start of a spending spree .
" the elevated level of inflation , which is likely to persist in the short term , still weighs heavily on the purchasing power of private households , " koch said .
germany , europe braced for slowdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb has kept interest rates steady several recent business surveys suggested that germany 's economy could be weakening .
growth forecasts for the european union were also cut by half a percentage point on monday .
the eu economy is expected to grow by 2 percent this year and 1.8 percent in 2009 , according to estimates from the european commission .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth forecasts were similarly cut to 1.7 and 1.5 percent respectively .
the european slowdown was blamed on turmoil on the financial markets , soaring commodity prices and the poor performance of the united states , europe 's main trading partner .
" economic growth is moderating in the eu and euro area and the current , imported inflationary pressures are a matter of concern , " eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
officials in brussels said that despite the slowdown , the eu economy remained " in a relatively good position to weather the global headwinds " thanks to sound fundamentals .
its average public deficit was below 1 percent of gdp in 2007 , while the eu unemployment rate was expected to drop from 7.1 percent last year to 6.8 percent this year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .

they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .
and the eu aims to reduce subsidies to large farms . the reforms that have already been implemented are currently being reviewed by commissioner mariann fischer-boel .

are they partly responsible for the current food crisis ?
the eu says no , but experts say subsidies can imbalance the market over the long-term . " there is no connection between eu agricultural subsidies and the rise in food prices or the food shortage in developing countries , " said michael mann , spokesman for the eu agriculture office in brussels . that may have been the case fifteen years ago , added mann , when some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.6 billion -rrb- went into export subsidies , but these will have sunk to one billion by the end of this year . in total , the eu spends over 42 billion euros on agriculture , which represents over 40 percent of its entire budget .
as the largest financial contributor to the 27-member bloc , germany 's share in the agriculture pot adds up to around 9 billion euros .
it also receives 6 billion euros in agricultural subsidies , which mainly go to individual farms or to agrarian development . subsidies may hurt development bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers should select their products based on the market , not on subsidies thierry kesteloot , who is responsible for agriculture and food supply at the aid organization oxfam in brussels , said that there is no direct relationship between the eu 's subsidies and the current food crisis - at least in the short-term .
long-term , on the other hand , would be a different matter . " eu subsidies that serve to expand europe 's competitiveness on the international markets hinder the development of agriculture in developing countries , " he said . but mann pointed out that there are hardly any trade restrictions on developing countries .
a special program for the world 's 49 poorest countries guarantees them free access to the european market for every product except arms - and without any quotas . thanks to subsidies , the eu used to be one of the largest exporters of sugar , but it now imports its sugar from developing countries , said mann . tilling the soil with subsidy reforms until now , exactly how much eu member states receive in subsidies and what they do with the money has been a well-kept secret .
germany has also refused to disclose the details about the funding it gets from brussels .
but that 's about to change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring food prices have led to recent protests in developing countries " as of april 2009 , every recipient of agricultural subsidies must disclose how much they receive , " said mann . the eu 's agricultural policy has been in a state of reform since the agriculture and fisheries council in luxembourg agreed in 2003 to fundamentally change its approach . one important point has separating premiums from products , which means that the farmers decide themselves what they produce .
they can thus choose themselves what to grow based on market demand rather than the size of the premiums . in addition , subsidy payments are contingent on certain standards pertaining to environmental protection , animal welfare and quality control in food products .
increasingly , funds are also being paid into agrarian development programs instead of handed out to farmers directly .

yet as gas prices continue to climb , opposition leaders said that 's not enough . " we 've got to use every chance we have to save energy , " merkel told the bild am sonntag newspaper in an interview published on sunday , april 27 . merkel , asked about rising energy and food prices , said that people need to think about various energy-saving measures including insulating buildings , using renewable energy , switching to energy-efficient appliances and buying cars that use less fuel .

" i would call on the chancellor to immediately make it clear whether the coalition will limit fuel , heating and gas prices . " in germany , consumers were paying 1.43 euros on monday per liter of unleaded gas and about 1.36 per liter for diesel . the fdp , a free-market liberal party , also called on the government to lower gas prices , but said it should be achieved through tax cuts .

merkel has refused to support speed limits which would improve fuel efficiency . it 's also unclear whether germans will buy more fuel-efficient cars despite rising gas prices .
germans remain extremely proud of cars made by companies such as audi , bmw , mercedes and porsche . these cars are often less fuel efficient than french , italian and japanese models . merkel 's support questioned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biofuel continues to find support in germany merkel 's government has also been accused by environmental groups of backing down from earlier support for tough new european union regulations to limit co2 emissions .
merkel 's government is concerned that the new measures will particularly harm german companies , which produce many of the luxury cars that will not meet new fuel efficiency standards . germany accepts the need for legal curbs on car emissions , but it wants all categories of cars to cut their emissions , german officials say .
that would mean that smaller , cleaner vehicles produced by france and italy that already meet the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometer would have to further reduce emissions .
germany has also called for a phase-in of the mandatory system , which is supposed to start in 2012 . biodiesel issue not going away merkel also continues to come under heavy criticism for defending biofuels in the face of food shortages . " i , like the chancellor , am very much in favor of maintaining the goals for biofuels , " agriculture minister horst seehofer told the dpa news agency on monday in berlin . the levels were set " on good grounds " and remain the right way to go , seehofer said . greenpeace protested the government support for biofuels on monday , holding signs that said " bread instead of biofuel .

" today i am optimistic " that eu foreign ministers will approve the start of talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- with russia and the signature of a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia , eu foreign-policy chief javier solana said .
serbian foreign minister vuk jeremic echoed that stance , saying that his country " hopes that these technical steps -lrb- i.e. signing the saa -rrb- will be made sooner rather than later , to the benefit of the peoples of the balkans and the eu . "
on tuesday , the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states are set to meet in luxembourg , with both documents on the agenda .
ministers are expected to continue a long-running debate over serbia 's saa , a document which is widely seen as a precursor to full membership talks .
divisions within the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana -lrb- left -rrb- and vuk jeremic most eu members favour signing the saa , which was initialled in november , before serbia holds snap elections on may 11 , as a way of boosting pro-eu forces in the country .
the netherlands and belgium , however , oppose such a move , saying that serbia must first hand over the remaining war-crimes suspects to the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague .
following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .

following talks with jeremic , slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose homeland currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , said that " we 're still looking for a solution that would satisfy both the serbs and the dutch and the belgians and all of us , and as you can understand , this is difficult . "
but jeremic played down the question of whether a decision on the saa could influence the knife-edge vote , saying that " serbia is trying to look at this outside the context of the elections - the continuation of the european integration process is what matters at this stage . "
serbia is already cooperating fully with icty and hopes to arrest the remaining fugitives very soon , he said .
no last-minute changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has delivered many indicted war criminals , but not karadzic -lrb- left -rrb- and mladic ministers could agree to sign the saa but not to implement it until the fugitives have been handed over , rupel said .
the saa , however , can only be signed in the version in which it was initialled , making it impossible to add any such declaration to the text itself .
officials in brussels also hope that the ministers will agree to launch talks with russia on the pca , an agreement covering relations on fields ranging from education and culture to energy and trade .
lithuania has so far opposed the opening of talks in protest at russia 's closure of oil to its only refinery , and moscow 's recent decision to open relations with the breakaway georgian provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia .
" lithuania is a distinguished member of the eu and a dear friend of the presidency so we 're trying to find a language that would suit lithuania , " rupel said .
" on the other hand , we 're all interested in moving the pca on ...
i think we have to find a compromise there . "
on tuesday evening , representatives of the eu presidency - currently held by slovenia - and the european commission are set to meet russian foreign minister sergei lavrov .
eu leaders are particularly keen to begin talks on the pca now , as they hope that the recent election of dmitry medvedev as russia 's next president will allow for an improvement in the current troubled atmosphere between europe and russia .

he met his counterpart pervez musharraf and prime minister yousaf raza gilani for talks , which focussed largely on plans for a pipeline from iran to pakistan and india , which is to be over 2,500 kilometres long and will carry natural gas from iran to the indian subcontinent . president ahmadinejad flew into chaklala airbase in rawalpindi , a garrison town not far from the capital islamabad , where he was met by the pakistani minister for water and power , as well as other officials and an air force honour guard .
he was later received by his pakistani counterpart , pervez musharraf , at the presidential palace .
top of the agenda was the multi-million dollar iran-pakistan-india gas pipeline .
the two presidents cleared the final hurdles and gave their foreign ministers the task of coming to an agreement about a mutually convenient date .
professor pervez iqbar cheema , a political expert based in islamabad , was sure it would not take long now : “ i think the agreement on this iran-pakistan-india pipeline will be finalised within weeks .
the mechanism is already in place .
reportedly , iran has already started laying the pipeline on its territory . ”
but officially , work on the pipeline is expected to start in 2009 .
stalled talks the project was tabled in 1994 but talks stalled because of tension between india and pakistan over transit fees .
however , the current energy crisis and spiralling oil prices brought the two sides back to the negotiating table .
last week , india ’ s oil minister murli deora said during a visit to islamabad that the two sides had agreed to the project in principle .
while his pakistani counterpart , khwaja muhammad asif , told the media that the project would be beneficial to both sides .
talks about the pipeline were also delayed by washington ’ s aversion to it .
us officials have warned it could be detrimental to efforts to isolate iran over its nuclear energy programme .
reportedly , washington has tried to apply pressure on india to opt out of the project .
but india is booming and in urgent need of energy supplies - it imports 70 percent of its energy needs and wants to secure them .
iran insists its controversial programme is only for energy purposes .
nuclear-armed pakistan supports this stance , saying tehran has a right to peaceful nuclear technology .
peace is also the aim of the pipeline , the pakistani and iranian presidents said on monday before turning to other matters .
electricity and regional stability after their meeting , pakistan ’ s foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi spoke to reporters : “ this pipeline will promote peace and friendship .
iran has also decided to export electricity to pakistan ; so far pakistan takes only 35 megawatts of electricity from iran but the plan is to import 1,100 megawatts . ”
the electricity from iran will help pakistan to meet its growing energy demands and reduce recurring power outages - especially on its south-western coast .
ahmadinejad and musharraf also discussed regional security , especially in afghanistan , saying that peace there was vital for ensuring stability .
the iranian president held a separate meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gilani to discuss bilateral economic ties .
they agreed to focus more on trade and develop the regional economy in the future .
ahmadinejad ’ s next stop on his whistle-stop tour of south asia is sri lanka .
on tuesday , he is due in india .
india has already reportedly rebuked a us official who said new delhi should urge ahmadinejad to curtail his nuclear programme when he visits . anne thomas 28/04/08 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic gas pipeline will bring " peace and friendship " say iran and pakistan 9798 global media forum human rights in a globalized world - challenges for the media listen to asia compact the latest from asia , monday to friday asia compact 16.06.11 us-pakistani relationship on thin ice thailand ’ s opposition parties in need of the ' rice vote ' india is drafting a law to tackle communal violence podcast rss-feed listen to asia live mobile indonesia investment chief gita wiryawan speaks about scope for investment in indonesia women women afghanistan , india and pakistan are among the most dangerous countries for women in the world .

no thanks ! "
after belgium and the netherlands gave a conditional green light to a serbia-eu pact , the 27-member bloc will try to agree on a gesture of support to pro-western parties in serbia before elections on may 11 . belgium and the netherlands are ready to accept an eu accord with the balkan country , but insist that its full implementation depends on full serbian war crime tribunal cooperation , belgium 's foreign ministry said ahead of an eu foreign ministers ' meeting on tuesday , april 28 . the two countries would agree to a proposed stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , but serbia " should not benefit from the advantages of this accord without full cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , " belgian foreign ministry spokesman francois delhaye told the afp news agency . carrot or stick ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants serbia to hand over alleged war criminal mladic most eu members have been in favor of signing the saa , but the belgian and dutch governments believe that belgrade should first help bring former bosnian serb general ratko mladic to the united nations court . mladic , along with bosnian serb wartime leader radovan karadzic , is accused of genocide for the massacre of up to 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica in 1995 after dutch peacekeepers guarding the area were forced to abandon the enclave . the dutch stance on serbia and the icty is likely influenced by the fact that wim kok 's government resigned in 2002 after a report on the srebrenica massacre blamed politicians for sending the dutch un troops on an impossible mission . dutch analysts say the country 's society remains traumatized by the event . the kosovo question the eu , however , is concerned about the possible outcome of the snap parliamentary elections in serbia , in which pro-european president boris tadic 's democratic party will face a tough challenge from extreme nationalist radical party and tadic 's former coalition partner , the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- . the serbian coalition government collapsed in march after the then southern serbian province kosovo unilaterally declared independence , which was recognized by most - although not all - eu member states , and nationalist prime minister vojislav kostunica -lrb- dss -rrb- broke ranks with pro-western tadic over ties with the eu . even if belgium and the netherlands give a go-ahead to a provisional signing of the saa on tuesday , analysts are concerned that boosting pro-western serbs so close to the elections may in fact backfire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the serbian government collapsed in march after kosovo declared independence " public anger over western support for kosovo 's independence is such that any attempt by the eu or us to support pro-western parties prior to the elections risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " the international crisis group 's senior adviser james lyon said in a statement . in a report entitled " will the real serbia please stand up ? " the think tank predicted kosovo 's secession from serbia would have an important impact on the upcoming elections . " any attempt before the may 11 elections to pressure or induce belgrade into more cooperation risks strengthening the nationalist vote , " it said . mounting tensions meanwhile , three people were injured in a blast overnight in northern kosovo , populated mostly by the serb minority , kosovo police said on sunday . " a blast occurred around 2:15 a.m.
-lrb- 0015 gmt -rrb- in the center of leposavic , " a serb-populated town , police spokesman besim hoti told afp . hoti said an " explosive device , apparently a hand grenade , was thrown from a moving vehicle , " adding that an investigation was underway . the blast took place just hours after the start of the celebration of orthodox easter .
the three injured were taken to hospital in nearby kosovska mitrovica . there are around 40,000 mostly orthodox christian serbs living in the northern part of kosovo , out of the 120,000 who remain here . tadic in kosovo the incident occurred as tadic arrived in kosovo to celebrate easter at the decani monastery , located some 90 kilometers -lrb- 55 miles -rrb- west of the capital pristina . the 14th century monastery is one of the most revered in the serbian orthodox church and a unesco world heritage site since 2004 . tadic 's visit to kosovo - his first since the province declared independence - was approved by the un mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- but was not positively viewed by the kosovo government . " visits to kosovo that are designed for political propaganda , for creating conflict and encouraging hatred are unacceptable to us , " kosovo president fatmir sejdiu said . earlier this month , serbian authorities confirmed their intention to hold the vote on may 11 in 23 kosovo municipalities with a mainly serb population in albanian-majority kosovo . joachim ruecker , the head of the un mission in kosovo has ruled , however , that holding the local polls would breach security council resolution 1244 which governs the un presence in kosovo . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the projects include nursing help for teenage mothers , and children being taught how to discuss their feelings and about the danger of drugs .
it is hoped early assistance will help youngsters avoid anti-social behaviour .
gordon brown , who will address the project 's launch , said it was vital to help children reach their potential .
dedicated nurses nottingham is one of 20 pilot areas in the government 's family intervention programme , which aims to stop bad behaviour spiralling into offending .
families are already being helped by the scheme , with many signing behaviour contracts to ensure they stay on track .
under the extended scheme , teenage mothers will be given a dedicated nurse to help them interact with their child .
a £ 1m programme of lessons has also been introduced in some of the city 's schools to help children talk about their feelings rather than resort to confrontation .
graham allen , labour mp for nottingham north , also wants every 11-year-old in nottingham to be taught about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse . "
our target is to break the cycle , so that the kids who are born into some of the poorest families today have a realistic chance of getting the skills and qualifications they need " graham allen about 38,000 children under 18 in nottingham live in families on benefits or low incomes , according to mr allen .
a child from a family on benefits will have heard only 11 million words by the age of four , whereas a youngster of the same age with professional parents will have heard 50 million , the organisation overseeing the project said .
mr allen was inspired by a scheme in denver , colorado , which suggested that while intervention was expensive , every dollar spent saved 17 dollars in dealing with crime in the long term .
the mp said that for 30 years there had been a policy of late intervention which had " clearly failed " .
" we have had remedial measures such as ineffective young offenders ' institutions , when actually a fraction of the tax-payers ' money that is needed to fund these services could have helped youngsters avoid becoming involved in drugs and crime in the first place , " he said .

some head teachers have threatened to boycott the programme over costs .
the foundation phase , hailed by the assembly government as a major advance in the way young children are taught , will move away from traditional classroom teaching to learning through play-based activities for three to seven-year-olds .

volunteers - postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes - will be asked to eat a bar of chocolate a day for a year .
cocoa is rich in compounds called flavonoids , which are thought to benefit the heart .
the university of east anglia is using a specially formulated form of chocolate which contains more flavonoids than usual . "
a successful outcome of this research would hopefully mean being able to offer people at high risk better protection over and above that provided by conventional drugs " dr iain frame diabetes uk this compensates for the fact that many flavonoids are destroyed in the process of turning cocoa into chocolate .
soy - another source of flavonoids - has also been added to the special bars .
the scientists are testing the theory that adding flavonoids to the diet may give added protection against heart disease on top of that provided by prescription drugs .
deaths due to heart disease among women increase rapidly after the menopause and having type 2 diabetes increases this risk by a further three-and-a-half times .
if the trial confirms the hypothesis then it could have a far-reaching impact on the advice given to at-risk women .
additional protection lead researcher professor aedin cassidy said : " despite postmenopausal women being at a similar risk to men for developing cardiovascular disease , to date they are under-represented in clinical trials .
" we hope to show that adding flavonoids to their diets will provide additional protection from heart disease and give women the opportunity to take more control over reducing their risk of heart disease in the future . "
the researchers aim to recruit 150 women under the age of 70 with type 2 diabetes who have not had a period for at least a year , and who have been taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs for at least 12 months .
dr iain frame , director of research at the charity diabetes uk , said : " we certainly do n't advise people to start eating a lot of chocolate as it is very high in sugar and fat .
" we would always recommend that people with diabetes eat a diet low in fat , salt and sugar with plenty of fruit and vegetables . "
" however , there are compounds found in chocolate , called flavonoids , that are thought to provide some protection from heart disease .
" a successful outcome of this research would hopefully mean being able to offer people at high risk better protection over and above that provided by conventional drugs . "
