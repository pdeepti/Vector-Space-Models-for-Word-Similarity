a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .

11 , that it was aware of holes in its security system that provided access to bank account numbers and other personal information of some 30 million telekom mobile phone users . the company had no indication of a possible theft of the information . telekom 's customer data systems were freely accessible and open to manipulation after entering a simple username and password , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported in its edition to be released on monday . the security lapses were dealt with on thursday and new measures , including the use of unique transaction codes , was put in place as part of a new privacy protection program , a spokesman said on saturday .

it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

" the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "
speaking shortly before the g7 meeting , merkel said : " we feel more than ever in these times that it is no longer enough to have national rules . "
g7 plan short on detail but the g7 statement was a sign of the group 's reluctance to offer a common , cross-border solution to shore up banks on the brink of bankruptcy in their own countries . italian finance minister giulio tremonti complained the statement was " too weak " shortly before it was adopted , according to bloomberg news . but paulson defended the lack of specifics coming out of the g7 meeting and said no one had any reason to expect a one-size-fits all solution . " some in the markets are naive if they think that different countries with different financial systems , economies in different stages of development , economies with totally different structures ... and different political systems , different laws are going to come up with precisely the same policy to deal with the issues , " he said . he called the statement an " aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in global financial markets and the stresses on our financial institutions . " world " on the cusp of recession " the g7 bloc also promised " robust " guarantees for the savings deposits of consumers , but did not specify a level .
a number of countries have raised guarantees to ease people 's fears over the safety of their bank savings . some in europe such as ireland have extended full guarantees , prompting a few concerns over competition . imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn warned friday that the only way to restore market confidence was through " government intervention which is clear , comprehensive and cooperative among countries . " the g7 meeting came at a time when there have been suggestions that the bloc is an outdated tool to manage a crisis that has spread well beyond the united states and europe .
a group of 24 countries also meeting friday urged wealthier nations to include them in talks on resolving the financial turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders are working to quell a global financial maelstrom paulson will meet finance ministers from the group of 20 - which brings together the top advanced and emerging economies - on saturday , in a nod to the spreading nature of the crisis . strauss-kahn on thursday said the world was on the " cusp " of a recession after the imf forecast global growth of 3 per cent next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 11.10.2008 g7 vows urgent , decisive action to tackle financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 ministers vowed concerted , urgent action but details of the plan remain sketchy the world 's seven leading economies agreed to do everything in their power to beat a financial crisis threatening to plunge the world into recession , saying they will use " all available tools " to save tottering banks . at a crisis meeting in washington on friday , the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers and central bank heads said they would use " all available tools " to stabilize the financial system and unblock credit markets that have come to a virtual halt in the united states and europe . " the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "
speaking shortly before the g7 meeting , merkel said : " we feel more than ever in these times that it is no longer enough to have national rules . "
g7 plan short on detail but the g7 statement was a sign of the group 's reluctance to offer a common , cross-border solution to shore up banks on the brink of bankruptcy in their own countries . italian finance minister giulio tremonti complained the statement was " too weak " shortly before it was adopted , according to bloomberg news . but paulson defended the lack of specifics coming out of the g7 meeting and said no one had any reason to expect a one-size-fits all solution . " some in the markets are naive if they think that different countries with different financial systems , economies in different stages of development , economies with totally different structures ... and different political systems , different laws are going to come up with precisely the same policy to deal with the issues , " he said . he called the statement an " aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in global financial markets and the stresses on our financial institutions . " world " on the cusp of recession " the g7 bloc also promised " robust " guarantees for the savings deposits of consumers , but did not specify a level .
a number of countries have raised guarantees to ease people 's fears over the safety of their bank savings . some in europe such as ireland have extended full guarantees , prompting a few concerns over competition . imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn warned friday that the only way to restore market confidence was through " government intervention which is clear , comprehensive and cooperative among countries . " the g7 meeting came at a time when there have been suggestions that the bloc is an outdated tool to manage a crisis that has spread well beyond the united states and europe .
a group of 24 countries also meeting friday urged wealthier nations to include them in talks on resolving the financial turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders are working to quell a global financial maelstrom paulson will meet finance ministers from the group of 20 - which brings together the top advanced and emerging economies - on saturday , in a nod to the spreading nature of the crisis . strauss-kahn on thursday said the world was on the " cusp " of a recession after the imf forecast global growth of 3 per cent next year .
growth below 3 per cent is considered a global recession by the imf . the international monetary fund and world bank also hold their annual meetings in washington this weekend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.10.2008 austria reacts with shock to death of firebrand haider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider helped thrust anti-immigrant politics into the european mainstream austrian politicians from all sides paid tribute to far right leader joerg haider , who was killed in a car crash on saturday , describing him as a talented and charismatic yet highly controversial leader . the accident occurred near klagenfurt , capital of the province of carinthia where 58-year-old haider was governor - around 2 am -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- , police official meinhard schiller told german news agency dpa . haider was driving by himself when his car veered off the road after passing another vehicle .
it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .

when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "

berlin is also reportedly set to present its own rescue deal . the pair met at the home village and final resting place of general charles de gaulle on saturday , oct .
11 , one day before a paris summit on the global credit crisis of the leaders of all 15 members of the euro zone . france and germany have " exactly the same view " on the financial crisis , sarkozy told reporters . " we have prepared a certain number of decisions that we will submit to our partners in the presence of the president of the european commission and the governor of the -lrb- european -rrb- central bank , " he said . " all decisions , all preparations and all analyses , we 're making together . " merkel agreed on the need for unity , and said governments would have to " redirect the markets so that they serve the people , and not ruin them . " she also said paris and berlin were " on the same path as regards putting in place a concerted and coherent reaction for the euro zone . "
the chancellor , however , added that there was also " naturally room for maneuver for each member state . " both leaders also rejected establishing a common european fund to aid banks .
sarkozy said a pan-european pot would create " gigantic problems . " this is n't about a european fund , but about balanced behavior by all member states , " merkel added . euro zone mulls following british lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone will discuss following the bank of england in partially nationalizing banks the heads of the european union 's four biggest economies - britain , france , germany and italy - had held a first emergency summit one week earlier but merkel and sarkozy were split over the need for a common plan . after a week of plunging stock markets , and crisis talks on friday between the finance ministers of the g7 industrial powers , the euro zone has agreed to try once more to coordinate a response . sunday 's meeting follows a move by britain 's prime minister gordon brown to guarantee inter-bank lending and to offer to take stakes in some of the country 's biggest banks in a program of partial nationalization . french finance minister christine lagarde said that while french banks were in a relatively good position and would probably not need a government buy-in , other european economies may benefit from following the british example . " it 's very likely , because european banks are also under-capitalized , " she said in an interview with france info radio on saturday .
" we have seen great britain , which is outside the euro zone , make propositions in this area .
we 'll have to see about that in the euro zone , but i suppose it 's one of the options . " germany on verge of new rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders and investors around the world are hoping for an end to falling markets there is a better chance of leaders making a nationalization deal after berlin , which has expressed its reluctance to governments taking stakes in private banks , was reportedly preparing a new bank rescue package that includes such an option . merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . " this is about providing the banks with sufficient capital , " merkel told reporters .
" i do n't rule out that there will be capital injections . " german media reported that merkel 's cabinet would meet to discuss the rescue package on monday and work to push it through parliament in an expedited process . the plan to be discussed at the euro-zone leaders ' meeting includes a mix of state guarantees and the possibility of the government buying a stake in faltering banks and could cost a total of between 300 billion euros and 400 billion euros , handelsblatt.com reported saturday . " i hope that the guarantees for inter-bank credit and a easing of accounting policies will be enough for german banks , " michael meister , the christian coalition 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the web site . he added that if the government did shore up banks with new capital , it would " demand substantial services in return .

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .

when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.10.2008 new nazi comedy hits german cinema screens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is parody the right genre for movies about world war two ?
a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny .

loew explained wednesday he would examine the performance levels and fitness of his squad during training before deciding on a starting xi .
" i want to see that each player is fully prepared mentally and physically for this game , otherwise they will not play , " he said .
" only players who are able to give 100 percent will start the match . "
in the lead-up to saturday 's clash against guus hiddink 's russia , the baden-wuerttemberger has had to deal with a conflict between team manager oliver bierhoff and ballack and also sort out a problem with his players ' jerseys .
but the 48-year-old has not lost sight of the fixture with euro 2008 semi-finalists russia , whom loew insists demand respect .
" i have rarely seen a team that can change its pace so rapidly .
they are incredibly strong in playing forward , " he said , adding that he believed the russian squad - nicknamed ‘ the red army ' - was as strong as that of european champions spain .

the man who was expected to fill that position , hannover 96 goalie robert enke , fractured his hand during training wednesday and underwent surgery friday .
the 31-year-old , who became first-choice keeper after stalwart jens lehmann retired earlier this year , is expected to be out for up to three months .
and so the gloves have been tossed to bayer leverkusen young-gun rene adler , who will undergo a baptism of fire tonight in front of an expected sell-out crowd of 70,000 at the westfalenstadion .
" i am looking forward to the game .
this is the highlight of my career , " the 23-year-old adler told a news conference friday .
national goalkeeper coach andreas koepke expressed the full faith of the coaching staff in the ability of uncapped adler , who got the nod ahead of fellow national squad tenderfoot tim wiese of werder bremen .
" we believe in his ability .
rene will play a super match .
i am fully convinced that he will show the same performance as in the bundesliga , " koepke said .
russians eye draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will be without three players in tonight 's clash while germany would be expected to go for maximum points in front of a fiercely passionate home crowd , russian attacking midfielder andrei arshavin said friday his team would be happy to take a solitary point from die mannschaft .
" the most dangerous part of the german team is their attack , " said the 27-year-old zenit st petersberg star .
" and a team in which michael ballack plays is already dangerous . "
russia coach guus hiddink agreed with arshavin 's analysis : " to come to germany and get a point from a stadium like the one we see in dortmund would be an absolute top result . "
" a germany team will never give up . "
russia will line up without striker roman pavlyuchenko , defender denis kolodin and midfielder dmitry torbinsky , all ruled out through injury .
the stakes having beaten liechtenstein 6-0 on sept .
6 and drawn 3-3 with finland in helsinki four days later , germany sits atop group 4 with four points , only one ahead of russia who beat wales 2-1 , also early last month .
a win by either germany or russia tonight would see them go top of their group , which also features minnows azerbaijan .
should germany lose tonight 's clash with russia they could drop to third place if wales happens to beat liechtenstein in cardiff tonight .
in 10 clashes between russia and germany , the former has been victorious on only one occasion - a friendly in 1985 .
likely squad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain michael ballack returns from injury to lead his country against russia at an open training session in dusseldorf on tuesday night watched by 21,500 fans , loew gave some indication as to who might start tonight 's clash .
lukas podolski featured as an attacking midfielder playing from the left , while leverkusen 's simon rolfes was seen in the centre of midfield just in front of ballack .
the bundesliga 's top scorer , patrick helmes , was partnered with miroslav klose up front .
" patrick helmes plays an important role in my planning .
he is playing very well at the moment , " loew said .
expected to start the match are , among those just mentioned , arne friedrich , per mertesacker , philipp lahm and bastian schweinsteiger . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russians eye draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will be without three players in tonight 's clash while germany would be expected to go for maximum points in front of a fiercely passionate home crowd , russian attacking midfielder andrei arshavin said friday his team would be happy to take a solitary point from die mannschaft .
" the most dangerous part of the german team is their attack , " said the 27-year-old zenit st petersberg star .
" and a team in which michael ballack plays is already dangerous . "
russia coach guus hiddink agreed with arshavin 's analysis : " to come to germany and get a point from a stadium like the one we see in dortmund would be an absolute top result . "
" a germany team will never give up . "
russia will line up without striker roman pavlyuchenko , defender denis kolodin and midfielder dmitry torbinsky , all ruled out through injury .
the stakes having beaten liechtenstein 6-0 on sept .
6 and drawn 3-3 with finland in helsinki four days later , germany sits atop group 4 with four points , only one ahead of russia who beat wales 2-1 , also early last month .
a win by either germany or russia tonight would see them go top of their group , which also features minnows azerbaijan .
should germany lose tonight 's clash with russia they could drop to third place if wales happens to beat liechtenstein in cardiff tonight .
in 10 clashes between russia and germany , the former has been victorious on only one occasion - a friendly in 1985 .
likely squad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain michael ballack returns from injury to lead his country against russia at an open training session in dusseldorf on tuesday night watched by 21,500 fans , loew gave some indication as to who might start tonight 's clash .
lukas podolski featured as an attacking midfielder playing from the left , while leverkusen 's simon rolfes was seen in the centre of midfield just in front of ballack .
the bundesliga 's top scorer , patrick helmes , was partnered with miroslav klose up front .
" patrick helmes plays an important role in my planning .
he is playing very well at the moment , " loew said .
expected to start the match are , among those just mentioned , arne friedrich , per mertesacker , philipp lahm and bastian schweinsteiger . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "
speaking shortly before the g7 meeting , merkel said : " we feel more than ever in these times that it is no longer enough to have national rules . "
g7 plan short on detail but the g7 statement was a sign of the group 's reluctance to offer a common , cross-border solution to shore up banks on the brink of bankruptcy in their own countries . italian finance minister giulio tremonti complained the statement was " too weak " shortly before it was adopted , according to bloomberg news . but paulson defended the lack of specifics coming out of the g7 meeting and said no one had any reason to expect a one-size-fits all solution . " some in the markets are naive if they think that different countries with different financial systems , economies in different stages of development , economies with totally different structures ... and different political systems , different laws are going to come up with precisely the same policy to deal with the issues , " he said . he called the statement an " aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in global financial markets and the stresses on our financial institutions . " world " on the cusp of recession " the g7 bloc also promised " robust " guarantees for the savings deposits of consumers , but did not specify a level .
a number of countries have raised guarantees to ease people 's fears over the safety of their bank savings . some in europe such as ireland have extended full guarantees , prompting a few concerns over competition . imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn warned friday that the only way to restore market confidence was through " government intervention which is clear , comprehensive and cooperative among countries . " the g7 meeting came at a time when there have been suggestions that the bloc is an outdated tool to manage a crisis that has spread well beyond the united states and europe .
a group of 24 countries also meeting friday urged wealthier nations to include them in talks on resolving the financial turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders are working to quell a global financial maelstrom paulson will meet finance ministers from the group of 20 - which brings together the top advanced and emerging economies - on saturday , in a nod to the spreading nature of the crisis . strauss-kahn on thursday said the world was on the " cusp " of a recession after the imf forecast global growth of 3 per cent next year .
growth below 3 per cent is considered a global recession by the imf . the international monetary fund and world bank also hold their annual meetings in washington this weekend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 11.10.2008 g7 vows urgent , decisive action to tackle financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 ministers vowed concerted , urgent action but details of the plan remain sketchy the world 's seven leading economies agreed to do everything in their power to beat a financial crisis threatening to plunge the world into recession , saying they will use " all available tools " to save tottering banks . at a crisis meeting in washington on friday , the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers and central bank heads said they would use " all available tools " to stabilize the financial system and unblock credit markets that have come to a virtual halt in the united states and europe . " the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "

" the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "
speaking shortly before the g7 meeting , merkel said : " we feel more than ever in these times that it is no longer enough to have national rules . "
g7 plan short on detail but the g7 statement was a sign of the group 's reluctance to offer a common , cross-border solution to shore up banks on the brink of bankruptcy in their own countries . italian finance minister giulio tremonti complained the statement was " too weak " shortly before it was adopted , according to bloomberg news . but paulson defended the lack of specifics coming out of the g7 meeting and said no one had any reason to expect a one-size-fits all solution .

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .

when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .

and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .

loew explained wednesday he would examine the performance levels and fitness of his squad during training before deciding on a starting xi .
" i want to see that each player is fully prepared mentally and physically for this game , otherwise they will not play , " he said .
" only players who are able to give 100 percent will start the match . "
in the lead-up to saturday 's clash against guus hiddink 's russia , the baden-wuerttemberger has had to deal with a conflict between team manager oliver bierhoff and ballack and also sort out a problem with his players ' jerseys .

it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.10.2008 new nazi comedy hits german cinema screens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is parody the right genre for movies about world war two ?
a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny .

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is also reportedly set to present its own rescue deal . the pair met at the home village and final resting place of general charles de gaulle on saturday , oct .
11 , one day before a paris summit on the global credit crisis of the leaders of all 15 members of the euro zone . france and germany have " exactly the same view " on the financial crisis , sarkozy told reporters . " we have prepared a certain number of decisions that we will submit to our partners in the presence of the president of the european commission and the governor of the -lrb- european -rrb- central bank , " he said . " all decisions , all preparations and all analyses , we 're making together . " merkel agreed on the need for unity , and said governments would have to " redirect the markets so that they serve the people , and not ruin them . " she also said paris and berlin were " on the same path as regards putting in place a concerted and coherent reaction for the euro zone . "
the chancellor , however , added that there was also " naturally room for maneuver for each member state . " both leaders also rejected establishing a common european fund to aid banks .
sarkozy said a pan-european pot would create " gigantic problems . " this is n't about a european fund , but about balanced behavior by all member states , " merkel added . euro zone mulls following british lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone will discuss following the bank of england in partially nationalizing banks the heads of the european union 's four biggest economies - britain , france , germany and italy - had held a first emergency summit one week earlier but merkel and sarkozy were split over the need for a common plan . after a week of plunging stock markets , and crisis talks on friday between the finance ministers of the g7 industrial powers , the euro zone has agreed to try once more to coordinate a response . sunday 's meeting follows a move by britain 's prime minister gordon brown to guarantee inter-bank lending and to offer to take stakes in some of the country 's biggest banks in a program of partial nationalization . french finance minister christine lagarde said that while french banks were in a relatively good position and would probably not need a government buy-in , other european economies may benefit from following the british example . " it 's very likely , because european banks are also under-capitalized , " she said in an interview with france info radio on saturday .
" we have seen great britain , which is outside the euro zone , make propositions in this area .
we 'll have to see about that in the euro zone , but i suppose it 's one of the options . " germany on verge of new rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders and investors around the world are hoping for an end to falling markets there is a better chance of leaders making a nationalization deal after berlin , which has expressed its reluctance to governments taking stakes in private banks , was reportedly preparing a new bank rescue package that includes such an option . merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . " this is about providing the banks with sufficient capital , " merkel told reporters .
" i do n't rule out that there will be capital injections . " german media reported that merkel 's cabinet would meet to discuss the rescue package on monday and work to push it through parliament in an expedited process . the plan to be discussed at the euro-zone leaders ' meeting includes a mix of state guarantees and the possibility of the government buying a stake in faltering banks and could cost a total of between 300 billion euros and 400 billion euros , handelsblatt.com reported saturday . " i hope that the guarantees for inter-bank credit and a easing of accounting policies will be enough for german banks , " michael meister , the christian coalition 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the web site . he added that if the government did shore up banks with new capital , it would " demand substantial services in return .

but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful .

when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "

when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

poles have consequently accused the commission of germanizing the name of the father of astronomy , nicolas copernicus .
but there is more to the matter than simply a few letters .
copernicus ' nationality has since long been a source of argument between germans and poles .
viewed in poland as one of the nation 's greatest figures , germans also consider the man to be one of their own .
rewriting history ?
conservative polish member of the european parliament adam bielan , in a letter to the european commission , took aim at verheugen 's historical interpretation regarding copernicus .
“ by using the german spelling , verheugen falsifies history and betrays either a lack of awareness or bad intentions , " he wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just a game when it comes to the letters in this astronomer 's name janusz ziolkowski , vice president of the space and satellite studies department of the polish academy of science also expressed displeasure with the new german spelling , but proposed a diplomatic solution .
" we are not insisting that the eu program necessarily use the polish spelling , mikolaj kopernik .
this would make the astronomer less universal , ” he said .
“ we would like to see the latin spelling - copernicus - used . ”
a never-ending debate the debate over copernicus ' origins wo n't be put to rest anytime soon however due to the political circumstances surrounding his birth .
he was born in 1473 in torun , which is now a polish city but had been ruled under both polish and prussian governance in the past . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "
speaking shortly before the g7 meeting , merkel said : " we feel more than ever in these times that it is no longer enough to have national rules . "
g7 plan short on detail but the g7 statement was a sign of the group 's reluctance to offer a common , cross-border solution to shore up banks on the brink of bankruptcy in their own countries . italian finance minister giulio tremonti complained the statement was " too weak " shortly before it was adopted , according to bloomberg news . but paulson defended the lack of specifics coming out of the g7 meeting and said no one had any reason to expect a one-size-fits all solution . " some in the markets are naive if they think that different countries with different financial systems , economies in different stages of development , economies with totally different structures ... and different political systems , different laws are going to come up with precisely the same policy to deal with the issues , " he said . he called the statement an " aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in global financial markets and the stresses on our financial institutions . " world " on the cusp of recession " the g7 bloc also promised " robust " guarantees for the savings deposits of consumers , but did not specify a level .
a number of countries have raised guarantees to ease people 's fears over the safety of their bank savings . some in europe such as ireland have extended full guarantees , prompting a few concerns over competition . imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn warned friday that the only way to restore market confidence was through " government intervention which is clear , comprehensive and cooperative among countries . " the g7 meeting came at a time when there have been suggestions that the bloc is an outdated tool to manage a crisis that has spread well beyond the united states and europe .
a group of 24 countries also meeting friday urged wealthier nations to include them in talks on resolving the financial turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders are working to quell a global financial maelstrom paulson will meet finance ministers from the group of 20 - which brings together the top advanced and emerging economies - on saturday , in a nod to the spreading nature of the crisis . strauss-kahn on thursday said the world was on the " cusp " of a recession after the imf forecast global growth of 3 per cent next year .
growth below 3 per cent is considered a global recession by the imf . the international monetary fund and world bank also hold their annual meetings in washington this weekend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny .
-lrb- 11.01.2007 -rrb- hitler comedy breaks german taboos is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?
director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits .

" i want to see that each player is fully prepared mentally and physically for this game , otherwise they will not play , " he said .
" only players who are able to give 100 percent will start the match . "
in the lead-up to saturday 's clash against guus hiddink 's russia , the baden-wuerttemberger has had to deal with a conflict between team manager oliver bierhoff and ballack and also sort out a problem with his players ' jerseys .

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

the imf warned of the growing possibility of a global finance " meltdown . " germany is expected to guarantee interbank loans for up to several hundred billion euros and bail out banks in exchange for shares in the institution , similar to the partial nationalization plan announced in britain this week . " this is about providing the banks with sufficient capital , " merkel told reporters .
" i do n't rule out that there will be capital injections . " chancellor angela merkel has said on saturday , oct .
11 , that she will sign off with fellow euro zone leaders sunday before going into the rescue plan 's details .
merkel 's cabinet is set to approve the plan on monday , the web site of the german business daily handelsblatt reported . the bail-out represents a change our course for germany , which tried to sit out the crisis before stock markets around the world plunged last week . " the objective is to pass the necessary laws as soon as possible so the markets calm , " an anonymous government official told the paper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks could be getting a shot of money the extra liquidity would be pumped into german banks and government guarantees would be offered as a backstop , while the sum of 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 134 billion -rrb- at the most was tagged as an equity injection , handelsblatt quoted a german delegation source in washington saying . the news magazine der spiegel quoted " government experts " saying the plan would likely cost between 50 billion euros and 100 billion euros . equity is important in the current crisis because the distressed loans vastly outweigh the assets that the banks own themselves . expedited parliamentary passage the timetable requires the two parliamentary groups in merkel 's coalition to meet by tuesday to approve the legislation .
for her part , merkel has promised " clarity by monday . " merkel 's party 's commitment to private enterprise means the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- will be hostile to any government interference in the rescued banks ' day to day affairs , so the legislation may have to forbid state influence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the credit crunch will likely keep german parliamentarians busy next week handelsblatt said the bundestag budget committee would hold hearings on the legislation on wednesday , with pressure for a first reading of the legislation in parliament before the week was out . an even faster passage was planned , with both chambers of parliament and germany 's mainly ceremonial president , horst koehler , approving the package by week 's end , according to der spiegel . foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , the ranking social democrat in the merkel coalition , told the german news agency dpa , " we 've never needed such sustained crisis management skills as at the moment . " imf : globe at brink of systemic meltdown der spiegel quoted him as also calling for international financial reforms in wake of the on-going credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants the imf to take on a new oversight role " we need a world financial group , an enhanced g8 , to discuss a new order of global financial relations , " he said .
" in addition to the g8 states , the emerging economic powers like brazil , india and china should belong to it with equal rights and obligations and perhaps this or that country from the arab world . " he also called for a " completely new financial overseer under the aegis of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , " saying he had already discussed this with imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn . earlier , strauss-kahn said the global financial system was at the " brink of systemic meltdown . " " intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest us-based and european financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown , " strauss-kahn said after a meeting of the g7 and the world bank . european central bank president jean-claude trichet said time was needed to assess a series of steps taken by world central banks in recent days , including pouring billions of dollars into financial markets and lowering interest rates in the broadest coordinated cut on record . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is also reportedly set to present its own rescue deal . the pair met at the home village and final resting place of general charles de gaulle on saturday , oct .
11 , one day before a paris summit on the global credit crisis of the leaders of all 15 members of the euro zone . france and germany have " exactly the same view " on the financial crisis , sarkozy told reporters . " we have prepared a certain number of decisions that we will submit to our partners in the presence of the president of the european commission and the governor of the -lrb- european -rrb- central bank , " he said . " all decisions , all preparations and all analyses , we 're making together . " merkel agreed on the need for unity , and said governments would have to " redirect the markets so that they serve the people , and not ruin them . " she also said paris and berlin were " on the same path as regards putting in place a concerted and coherent reaction for the euro zone . "
the chancellor , however , added that there was also " naturally room for maneuver for each member state . " both leaders also rejected establishing a common european fund to aid banks .
sarkozy said a pan-european pot would create " gigantic problems . " this is n't about a european fund , but about balanced behavior by all member states , " merkel added . euro zone mulls following british lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone will discuss following the bank of england in partially nationalizing banks the heads of the european union 's four biggest economies - britain , france , germany and italy - had held a first emergency summit one week earlier but merkel and sarkozy were split over the need for a common plan . after a week of plunging stock markets , and crisis talks on friday between the finance ministers of the g7 industrial powers , the euro zone has agreed to try once more to coordinate a response . sunday 's meeting follows a move by britain 's prime minister gordon brown to guarantee inter-bank lending and to offer to take stakes in some of the country 's biggest banks in a program of partial nationalization . french finance minister christine lagarde said that while french banks were in a relatively good position and would probably not need a government buy-in , other european economies may benefit from following the british example . " it 's very likely , because european banks are also under-capitalized , " she said in an interview with france info radio on saturday .
" we have seen great britain , which is outside the euro zone , make propositions in this area .
we 'll have to see about that in the euro zone , but i suppose it 's one of the options . " germany on verge of new rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders and investors around the world are hoping for an end to falling markets there is a better chance of leaders making a nationalization deal after berlin , which has expressed its reluctance to governments taking stakes in private banks , was reportedly preparing a new bank rescue package that includes such an option . merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . " this is about providing the banks with sufficient capital , " merkel told reporters .
" i do n't rule out that there will be capital injections . " german media reported that merkel 's cabinet would meet to discuss the rescue package on monday and work to push it through parliament in an expedited process . the plan to be discussed at the euro-zone leaders ' meeting includes a mix of state guarantees and the possibility of the government buying a stake in faltering banks and could cost a total of between 300 billion euros and 400 billion euros , handelsblatt.com reported saturday . " i hope that the guarantees for inter-bank credit and a easing of accounting policies will be enough for german banks , " michael meister , the christian coalition 's deputy parliamentary leader , told the web site . he added that if the government did shore up banks with new capital , it would " demand substantial services in return .

" the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "
speaking shortly before the g7 meeting , merkel said : " we feel more than ever in these times that it is no longer enough to have national rules . "
g7 plan short on detail but the g7 statement was a sign of the group 's reluctance to offer a common , cross-border solution to shore up banks on the brink of bankruptcy in their own countries . italian finance minister giulio tremonti complained the statement was " too weak " shortly before it was adopted , according to bloomberg news . but paulson defended the lack of specifics coming out of the g7 meeting and said no one had any reason to expect a one-size-fits all solution . " some in the markets are naive if they think that different countries with different financial systems , economies in different stages of development , economies with totally different structures ... and different political systems , different laws are going to come up with precisely the same policy to deal with the issues , " he said . he called the statement an " aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in global financial markets and the stresses on our financial institutions . " world " on the cusp of recession " the g7 bloc also promised " robust " guarantees for the savings deposits of consumers , but did not specify a level .
a number of countries have raised guarantees to ease people 's fears over the safety of their bank savings . some in europe such as ireland have extended full guarantees , prompting a few concerns over competition . imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn warned friday that the only way to restore market confidence was through " government intervention which is clear , comprehensive and cooperative among countries . " the g7 meeting came at a time when there have been suggestions that the bloc is an outdated tool to manage a crisis that has spread well beyond the united states and europe .
a group of 24 countries also meeting friday urged wealthier nations to include them in talks on resolving the financial turmoil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european leaders are working to quell a global financial maelstrom paulson will meet finance ministers from the group of 20 - which brings together the top advanced and emerging economies - on saturday , in a nod to the spreading nature of the crisis . strauss-kahn on thursday said the world was on the " cusp " of a recession after the imf forecast global growth of 3 per cent next year .
growth below 3 per cent is considered a global recession by the imf . the international monetary fund and world bank also hold their annual meetings in washington this weekend . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poles have consequently accused the commission of germanizing the name of the father of astronomy , nicolas copernicus .
but there is more to the matter than simply a few letters .
copernicus ' nationality has since long been a source of argument between germans and poles .

conservative polish member of the european parliament adam bielan , in a letter to the european commission , took aim at verheugen 's historical interpretation regarding copernicus .
“ by using the german spelling , verheugen falsifies history and betrays either a lack of awareness or bad intentions , " he wrote .

" we are not insisting that the eu program necessarily use the polish spelling , mikolaj kopernik .
this would make the astronomer less universal , ” he said .
“ we would like to see the latin spelling - copernicus - used . ”
a never-ending debate the debate over copernicus ' origins wo n't be put to rest anytime soon however due to the political circumstances surrounding his birth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 11.10.2008 g7 vows urgent , decisive action to tackle financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 ministers vowed concerted , urgent action but details of the plan remain sketchy the world 's seven leading economies agreed to do everything in their power to beat a financial crisis threatening to plunge the world into recession , saying they will use " all available tools " to save tottering banks . at a crisis meeting in washington on friday , the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers and central bank heads said they would use " all available tools " to stabilize the financial system and unblock credit markets that have come to a virtual halt in the united states and europe . " the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .
" the economy is in the service of people , " not the inverse , she said , and the role of politicians was to show this " clearly . "
speaking shortly before the g7 meeting , merkel said : " we feel more than ever in these times that it is no longer enough to have national rules . "
g7 plan short on detail but the g7 statement was a sign of the group 's reluctance to offer a common , cross-border solution to shore up banks on the brink of bankruptcy in their own countries . italian finance minister giulio tremonti complained the statement was " too weak " shortly before it was adopted , according to bloomberg news . but paulson defended the lack of specifics coming out of the g7 meeting and said no one had any reason to expect a one-size-fits all solution . " some in the markets are naive if they think that different countries with different financial systems , economies in different stages of development , economies with totally different structures ... and different political systems , different laws are going to come up with precisely the same policy to deal with the issues , " he said . he called the statement an " aggressive action plan to address the turmoil in global financial markets and the stresses on our financial institutions . " world " on the cusp of recession " the g7 bloc also promised " robust " guarantees for the savings deposits of consumers , but did not specify a level .

it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy .

nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .

when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

loew explained wednesday he would examine the performance levels and fitness of his squad during training before deciding on a starting xi .
" i want to see that each player is fully prepared mentally and physically for this game , otherwise they will not play , " he said .
" only players who are able to give 100 percent will start the match . "
in the lead-up to saturday 's clash against guus hiddink 's russia , the baden-wuerttemberger has had to deal with a conflict between team manager oliver bierhoff and ballack and also sort out a problem with his players ' jerseys .
but the 48-year-old has not lost sight of the fixture with euro 2008 semi-finalists russia , whom loew insists demand respect .
" i have rarely seen a team that can change its pace so rapidly .
they are incredibly strong in playing forward , " he said , adding that he believed the russian squad - nicknamed ‘ the red army ' - was as strong as that of european champions spain .
adler to kit up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew has been tight-lipped about germany 's starting line-up one worry loew can abandon , however , is that of who will stand between germany 's sticks .
the man who was expected to fill that position , hannover 96 goalie robert enke , fractured his hand during training wednesday and underwent surgery friday .
the 31-year-old , who became first-choice keeper after stalwart jens lehmann retired earlier this year , is expected to be out for up to three months .
and so the gloves have been tossed to bayer leverkusen young-gun rene adler , who will undergo a baptism of fire tonight in front of an expected sell-out crowd of 70,000 at the westfalenstadion .
" i am looking forward to the game .
this is the highlight of my career , " the 23-year-old adler told a news conference friday .
national goalkeeper coach andreas koepke expressed the full faith of the coaching staff in the ability of uncapped adler , who got the nod ahead of fellow national squad tenderfoot tim wiese of werder bremen .
" we believe in his ability .
rene will play a super match .
i am fully convinced that he will show the same performance as in the bundesliga , " koepke said .
russians eye draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will be without three players in tonight 's clash while germany would be expected to go for maximum points in front of a fiercely passionate home crowd , russian attacking midfielder andrei arshavin said friday his team would be happy to take a solitary point from die mannschaft .
" the most dangerous part of the german team is their attack , " said the 27-year-old zenit st petersberg star .
" and a team in which michael ballack plays is already dangerous . "
russia coach guus hiddink agreed with arshavin 's analysis : " to come to germany and get a point from a stadium like the one we see in dortmund would be an absolute top result . "
" a germany team will never give up . "
russia will line up without striker roman pavlyuchenko , defender denis kolodin and midfielder dmitry torbinsky , all ruled out through injury .
the stakes having beaten liechtenstein 6-0 on sept .
6 and drawn 3-3 with finland in helsinki four days later , germany sits atop group 4 with four points , only one ahead of russia who beat wales 2-1 , also early last month .
a win by either germany or russia tonight would see them go top of their group , which also features minnows azerbaijan .
should germany lose tonight 's clash with russia they could drop to third place if wales happens to beat liechtenstein in cardiff tonight .
in 10 clashes between russia and germany , the former has been victorious on only one occasion - a friendly in 1985 .
likely squad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain michael ballack returns from injury to lead his country against russia at an open training session in dusseldorf on tuesday night watched by 21,500 fans , loew gave some indication as to who might start tonight 's clash .
lukas podolski featured as an attacking midfielder playing from the left , while leverkusen 's simon rolfes was seen in the centre of midfield just in front of ballack .
the bundesliga 's top scorer , patrick helmes , was partnered with miroslav klose up front .
" patrick helmes plays an important role in my planning .
he is playing very well at the moment , " loew said .
expected to start the match are , among those just mentioned , arne friedrich , per mertesacker , philipp lahm and bastian schweinsteiger . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .

when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.10.2008 austria reacts with shock to death of firebrand haider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider helped thrust anti-immigrant politics into the european mainstream austrian politicians from all sides paid tribute to far right leader joerg haider , who was killed in a car crash on saturday , describing him as a talented and charismatic yet highly controversial leader . the accident occurred near klagenfurt , capital of the province of carinthia where 58-year-old haider was governor - around 2 am -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- , police official meinhard schiller told german news agency dpa . haider was driving by himself when his car veered off the road after passing another vehicle .
it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .
i do n't have to become chancellor to do that . " dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i want to see that each player is fully prepared mentally and physically for this game , otherwise they will not play , " he said .
" only players who are able to give 100 percent will start the match . "
in the lead-up to saturday 's clash against guus hiddink 's russia , the baden-wuerttemberger has had to deal with a conflict between team manager oliver bierhoff and ballack and also sort out a problem with his players ' jerseys .

" the most dangerous part of the german team is their attack , " said the 27-year-old zenit st petersberg star .
" and a team in which michael ballack plays is already dangerous . "
russia coach guus hiddink agreed with arshavin 's analysis : " to come to germany and get a point from a stadium like the one we see in dortmund would be an absolute top result . "
" a germany team will never give up . "
russia will line up without striker roman pavlyuchenko , defender denis kolodin and midfielder dmitry torbinsky , all ruled out through injury .
the stakes having beaten liechtenstein 6-0 on sept .

a win by either germany or russia tonight would see them go top of their group , which also features minnows azerbaijan .

poles have consequently accused the commission of germanizing the name of the father of astronomy , nicolas copernicus .
but there is more to the matter than simply a few letters .
copernicus ' nationality has since long been a source of argument between germans and poles .
viewed in poland as one of the nation 's greatest figures , germans also consider the man to be one of their own .
rewriting history ?
conservative polish member of the european parliament adam bielan , in a letter to the european commission , took aim at verheugen 's historical interpretation regarding copernicus .
“ by using the german spelling , verheugen falsifies history and betrays either a lack of awareness or bad intentions , " he wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just a game when it comes to the letters in this astronomer 's name janusz ziolkowski , vice president of the space and satellite studies department of the polish academy of science also expressed displeasure with the new german spelling , but proposed a diplomatic solution .
" we are not insisting that the eu program necessarily use the polish spelling , mikolaj kopernik .
this would make the astronomer less universal , ” he said .
“ we would like to see the latin spelling - copernicus - used . ”
a never-ending debate the debate over copernicus ' origins wo n't be put to rest anytime soon however due to the political circumstances surrounding his birth .
he was born in 1473 in torun , which is now a polish city but had been ruled under both polish and prussian governance in the past . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 11.10.2008 g7 vows urgent , decisive action to tackle financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g7 ministers vowed concerted , urgent action but details of the plan remain sketchy the world 's seven leading economies agreed to do everything in their power to beat a financial crisis threatening to plunge the world into recession , saying they will use " all available tools " to save tottering banks . at a crisis meeting in washington on friday , the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- finance ministers and central bank heads said they would use " all available tools " to stabilize the financial system and unblock credit markets that have come to a virtual halt in the united states and europe . " the g7 agrees today that the current situation calls for urgent and exceptional action , " read a joint statement .
governments would " take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 is under pressure to act fast as global stocks plummet the meeting in washington came as stocks around the world plunged in record levels this week amid widespread fears of a global recession . the finance ministers of japan , germany , britain , france , canada , us and italy did not announce specific joint moves , but the group did suggest all seven governments were ready to shovel public funds into banks that are threatened with collapse for a lack of capital . the seven countries promised to " ensure that our banks ... can raise capital from public as well as private sources in sufficient amounts to re-establish confidence and permit them to continue lending to households and businesses . " germany working on british-style rescue plan ? on the sidelines of the meeting , some g7 members said they were planning to take equity stakes in their banks as part of a broader rescue plan and injection of capital . treasury secretary henry paulson said the us would buy shares in financial institutions in return for taking on their troubled mortgage assets , under authority already granted in the 700-billion-dollar rescue package approved by congress last week . in a sharp policy reversal , german finance minister peer steinbrueck said a similar plan for germany would be unveiled on monday .
britain passed its own bailout package earlier this week . " i 'm convinced we wo n't be making any headway by taking case-by-case measures , " steinbrueck said in washington .
" we have to move away from discretionary behavior and try to find an approach that works for the sector as a whole . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has vowed to unveil a new action plan for germany on monday german newspaper die welt reported that the government is working on a british-style rescue plan for its financial sector .
in a preview of an article to appear saturday , the paper reported without citing sources that the government is considering a plan to guarantee interbank loans , offer direct credit and take stakes in financial institutions . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel called friday for a framework of international market rules - in place of national regulations - to prevent financial crises like the one now threatening the world economy .

it then hit several obstacles , including a concrete foundation of a fence , and flipped over several times . the politician died on the way to a local hospital from serious injuries to the head , neck and chest , according to thomas koperna , medical chief of the klagenfurt hospital .
his left arm was almost severed , he said .
police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident , in which no one else was injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian police inspect the wreckage of haider 's car ' the end of the world ' haider , a charismatic populist and leader of the far-right alliance for the future of austria , was a deeply controversial figure and his death sparked strong reactions . " for us , this is like the end of the world , " alliance spokesman and deputy leader stefan petzner was quoted as saying by the austrian press agency apa . haider " was a politician who moved and changed austria , " petzner said at a press conference during which he was frequently overcome with emotion . austrian president heinz fischer said he was " deeply affected " by the death of haider .
but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy . "
nazi germany had enslaved jews and foreigners for its wartime economy .
haider was forced to sep down as governor of carinthia after that comment .
he was reelected as governor in 1999 . conservative leader josef proell said haider had brought a new style to austrian politics that had been " very successful . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist leader 's alliance won almost 11 per cent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s . in 2000 , haider led the freedom party into a government coalition as a junior partner of the conservative people 's party .
when the alliance was formed in 2005 , its officials took over the freedom party 's seats in cabinet until the coalition broke down in 2006 . the 2000 centre-right coalition , in which haider was not a cabinet member , met with strong criticism from european union members , who reacted by implementing diplomatic sanctions against austria . haider responsible for " incredible changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider with his supporters in september after his alliance won almost 11 percent of the vote freedom party leader heinz-christian strache , haider 's right-wing political rival , said saturday that haider was responsible for " incredible changes " in austria which for a long time had been dominated by a " fabric of power " spun by social democrats and mainstream conservatives .
filip dewinter , a leader of belgium 's far-right , anti-foreigner flemish party vlaams belang , praised haider on saturday as a " model of a modern , current successful right-nationalist politician , " who had given voice to the " silent majority of the population . "
in his last interview published by the regional kleine zeitung on saturday , haider indicated he no longer had ambitions for leading the country . " we changed a lot in carinthia and we will go on doing so in austria .

but he also pointed to the divisive nature of his politics , saying haider had been a " politician of great talent , " who had sparked enthusiasm as well as criticism . notorious for nazi-friendly comments haider turned austria 's small far right movement into a force to be reckoned with by often denigrating political opponents , and by tapping into revisionist and anti-immigrant sentiments . haider was notorious for provocative statements , such as his assertion in 1991 that the third reich under hitler had a " proper employment policy .

" i want to see that each player is fully prepared mentally and physically for this game , otherwise they will not play , " he said .
" only players who are able to give 100 percent will start the match . "
in the lead-up to saturday 's clash against guus hiddink 's russia , the baden-wuerttemberger has had to deal with a conflict between team manager oliver bierhoff and ballack and also sort out a problem with his players ' jerseys .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.10.2008 new nazi comedy hits german cinema screens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is parody the right genre for movies about world war two ?
a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .
controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brilliant comedy - or just bad tase ?
that 's not to say the results are uncontroversial .
when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .
the very first german-made film comedy about the nazis aired on public television network ard in 2002 .
in " goebbels and geduldig , " the nazi propaganda minister and a good-humoured jewish lookalike swap places in 1944 .
allegedly , the script had to be re-written dozens of times by nervous tv executives .
but these days , hitler and the nazis are fair game .
and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .
the production team already raised eyebrows in berlin in recent weeks when it advertised for extras with " aryan " looks and , ideally , amputed limbs .
times have changed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new movie is a send-up of " das boot " star of " u-900 , " atze schroeder is one of germany 's most popular stand-up comedians .
he said he was fully aware of the country 's sensitivies , but that times have changed .
" making nazis look foolish - that 's something honorable for a comedian in this day and age , " schroeder told german magazine tv spielfilm .
" it 's not a history lesson but rather it 's just a comedy about a guy who manages to get himself out of just about every possible jam you could imagine . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de jewish opinion divided over new hitler comedy jewish groups are split on " mein führer , " germany 's first home-grown comedy film about the former dictator .
critics debated the wisdom of portraying hitler as a buffoon - and the difficulty of making him funny .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits .

a world war ii comedy that hit cinema screens this week is the latest german movie to tackle what has long been an off-limits subject : the third reich . the plot of sven unterwaldt 's comedy " u-900 " involves a german forced to flee hitler 's germany after being caught in flagrante with a nazi bigwig 's daughter , whose life he later manages to save by hijacking a submarine .
it premiered across germany this week as the latest in the recent series of movies that take a comic approach to the holocaust .
unimaginable for decades , german film makers have become increasingly confident about treating world war ii as a bit of a farce .

when jewish director dani levy made the slapstick comedy " my fuehrer - the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " and depicted hitler as a bumbling fool who likes to play with a toy battleship in the bath , it was panned by critics , even though it did well at the box office .

and germany does n't seem to mind others sending up the third reich either .
right now , us director and king of trash quentin tarantino is in berlin to shoot " inglorious bastards , " starring hollywood actors brad pitt and diane kruger .
according to early reports , the movie is about a group of jewish soldiers in the us army sent on a nearly suicidal mission in france during world war ii .
it has already come in for criticism due to what is seen by many as a somewhat frivolous attitude towards the horrors of the second world war .

his critics saw him as an ambitious , racist opportunist who used anti-immigrant and pro-nazi rhetoric to stir up populist sentiment .
what is doubtless is that haider - whose death in a car crash at the age of 58 leaves a widow and two daughters - had charisma .
commentators said he worked a room like former us president bill clinton , embracing supporters and using the familiar " du " form of address .
joerg haider was born in the upper austrian town of bad goisern in 1950 and his parents were very early members of the nazi party , who moved to germany where they became party officials .
after the war , they were punished for their affiliations and forced to take up menial work .
critics say haider 's views were shaped by this background , although he said his family seldom discussed the past .
divisive figure after school , where he was regularly top of the class , haider studied law in vienna and joined the freedom party in 1976 .
he quickly rose through the ranks , becoming the party 's leader 10 years later .
around the same time he became party leader , haider inherited a controversial $ 16m estate in the southern province of carinthia where he became governor in 1989 .
joerg haider : key dates 1950 : born in upper austria 1976 : joins freedom party 1986 : elected party 's leader 1989 : elected governor of carinthia 2000 : resigns as party leader 2005 : founds alliance for austria 's future barental , or bear valley , was bought during world war ii by his great uncle from an italian jew who fled in 1940 .
critics say the sale was illegitimately forced upon the jewish owner by the nazis , but haider consistently denied this .
he amassed a formidable power base in carinthia , but his first stint as governor in 1989 ended abruptly when he praised the employment policies of nazi germany and was forced to resign .
he was re-elected , however , in 1999 and 2003 .
when he became leader of the freedom party , it was winning barely 5 % at the polls .
he had increased that support six-fold by 2000 , when he resigned his leadership after the party entered into a coalition government with the conservative people 's party .
despite his resignation as chairman , haider remained a key figure within the party apparatus .
he showed he still had considerable personal appeal with voters when he was re-elected as governor of the southern province of carinthia in 2004 , although national surveys at the time suggested many austrians mistrust him .
in 2005 , he launched a new party - the alliance for austria 's future - after a split in the freedom party threatened the ruling coalition .
he was subsequently expelled from the freedom party .
the new party 's increasing popularity won it 11 % of the vote in september 's general elections .
carinthia powerbase haider gained notoriety for his pro-nazi comments .
he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army which should be honoured " .
he also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
he later apologised for the comments although suspicions remained that his real views did not change .
haider always denied being an extremist and even compared himself politically to former uk prime minister tony blair .
during the 1999 austrian election campaign , he whipped up feeling against immigrants and suggested that without them the government 's austerity budget would not be necessary .
he tried to stop austria joining the european union in 1995 and attempted to force a referendum on whether to join the single currency .
on both issues he failed , but his views on the eu remained trenchant .
he opposed plans to let in new countries and called it a ' ' declaration of war against all working and upstanding people " .
the eu reciprocated haider 's sentiments , imposing sanctions against austria in 2000 in protest against his party 's role in government .

joerg haider : key dates 1950 : born in upper austria 1976 : joins freedom party 1986 : elected party 's leader 1989 : elected governor of carinthia 2000 : resigns as party leader 2005 : founds alliance for austria 's future barental , or bear valley , was bought during world war ii by his great uncle from an italian jew who fled in 1940 .
critics say the sale was illegitimately forced upon the jewish owner by the nazis , but haider consistently denied this .
he amassed a formidable power base in carinthia , but his first stint as governor in 1989 ended abruptly when he praised the employment policies of nazi germany and was forced to resign .
he was re-elected , however , in 1999 and 2003 .
when he became leader of the freedom party , it was winning barely 5 % at the polls .
he had increased that support six-fold by 2000 , when he resigned his leadership after the party entered into a coalition government with the conservative people 's party .
despite his resignation as chairman , haider remained a key figure within the party apparatus .
he showed he still had considerable personal appeal with voters when he was re-elected as governor of the southern province of carinthia in 2004 , although national surveys at the time suggested many austrians mistrust him .
in 2005 , he launched a new party - the alliance for austria 's future - after a split in the freedom party threatened the ruling coalition .
he was subsequently expelled from the freedom party .
the new party 's increasing popularity won it 11 % of the vote in september 's general elections .
carinthia powerbase haider gained notoriety for his pro-nazi comments .
he described world war ii concentration camps as " punishment camps " and said the nazi ss was " a part of the german army which should be honoured " .
with his death at 58 , haider leaves a widow and two daughters he also compared the deportation of jews by the nazis to the expulsion of sudeten germans from czechoslovakia after the war .
he later apologised for the comments although suspicions remained that his real views did not change .
haider always denied being an extremist and even compared himself politically to former uk prime minister tony blair .
during the 1999 austrian election campaign , he whipped up feeling against immigrants and suggested that without them the government 's austerity budget would not be necessary .
he tried to stop austria joining the european union in 1995 and attempted to force a referendum on whether to join the single currency .
on both issues he failed , but his views on the eu remained trenchant .
he opposed plans to let in new countries and called it a ' ' declaration of war against all working and upstanding people " .
the eu reciprocated haider 's sentiments , imposing sanctions against austria in 2000 in protest against his party 's role in government .

reports say the talks have been going on for a month but details of the deal vary from a merger to an acquisition by gm of chrysler .
gm is the leading manufacturer and chrysler third after ford .
all have been suffering with a plunge in us sales to 15-year lows .
neither of the parties have made any direct official comment .
ford move sources told the wall street journal that cerberus capital management , which owns 80.1 % of chrysler had proposed trading its automotive operations to gm in return for gm 's stake in the auto lender gmac financial services .
the new york times 's sources spoke of a merger that was a " 50-50 " possibility , although it could take weeks to finalise and had been stalled by the turmoil in the financial markets .
gm spokesman tony cervone said : " without referencing this specific rumour , as we 've often said , gm officials routinely discuss issues of mutual interest with other automakers . "
analysts have questioned chrysler 's position , given its reliance on north america for 90 % of its revenue .
both companies have been hard hit by falling truck and suv sales and are struggling to push through job cuts against union opposition .
gm shares hit a 60-year low this week .
it posted a second-quarter net loss of $ 15.5bn.
separately , reuters reports that ford is planning to sell most of its 33.4 % holding in japan 's mazda .

the g7 nations issued a five-point plan of " decisive action " to unfreeze credit markets , after a meeting in washington .
widespread fears of a global recession caused asian , european and us markets to tumble on friday despite rate cuts and cash injections by central banks .
the us also said it would invest directly in banks for the first time since the 1930s , following a uk move .
as well as the washington meeting of the g7 - which comprises the us , japan , britain , germany , france , italy and canada - the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- will hold talks in the us capital over the weekend .
leaders of the eurozone countries are also scheduled to meet in paris on sunday .
' protect savers ' after friday 's g7 meeting , us treasury secretary henry paulson said the group had a clear vision of what needed doing , and was working together to stabilise the world 's panic-stricken money markets .
" we are squarely focused on the immediate need to stabilise our financial market and recognise that investor confidence is critical to restore liquidity and enhance the stability of our financial system , " he said .
the five-point plan is intended to protect major banks and financial institutions from failure and ensure they can raise capital from public and private sources .
it includes steps to unfreeze the flow of credit and protect savers , although it did not reveal any specific measures .
it pledged to take " decisive action and use all available tools " to support financial institutions .
it also vowed to take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets ; ensure banks can raise capital from public as well as private sources ; and ensure national deposit insurance and guarantee programs are robust .
mr paulson said the us was working closely with china and japan - both of which hold large amounts of us treasury bonds - to resolve the crisis .
he added that the us government would buy bank equity .
" we 're going to do it as soon as we can do it and do it effectively , " mr paulson said .
on wednesday , the uk announced it would set aside £ 50bn to buy shares in the nation 's banks .
while the g7 statement identifies the main areas requiring urgent attention , it is short on detail , says the bbc 's andrew walker in washington , adding that much will now depend on how each government takes its own plans forward .
panic-stricken markets earlier on friday , us president george w bush said his government would continue to act to resolve the crisis .
speaking on the white house lawn , mr bush said the recent market turmoil was being driven by " uncertainty and fear " .
but he said the us authorities had a comprehensive strategy and a wide range of tools that they were using " aggressively " to fix the problems . "
we 're in this together and we 'll come through this together " president bush peston : global fix needed fear grips global stock markets credit crisis : world in turmoil mr bush defended last week 's rescue package , saying it was big enough , but stressing it would take time to have its full impact .
but volatile market conditions continued despite moves on wednesday by six of the main central banks to cut interest rates by 0.5 % and a separate move by china 's central bank to cut rates by 0.27 % .
wall street has lost a fifth of its value in the past 10 trading days , suffering one of its biggest weekly falls since the dow jones index was created 112 years ago .
markets in france , germany and britain plunged to end friday between seven and nine percent lower .
shares in asia also closed down sharply , with japan 's main nikkei index suffering its biggest one-day drop since the 1987 stock market crash .
as panic mounted , there were trading suspensions in several countries including russia , austria , iceland , romania , ukraine , brazil and indonesia .
amid the gloom , the british pound tumbled to a five-year low against the us dollar and oil prices plummeted to a one-year low .

the g7 nations issued a five-point plan of " decisive action " to unfreeze credit markets , after a meeting in washington .
widespread fears of a global recession caused asian , european and us markets to tumble on friday despite rate cuts and cash injections by central banks .
the us also said it would invest directly in banks for the first time since the 1930s , following a uk move .
as well as the washington meeting of the g7 - which comprises the us , japan , britain , germany , france , italy and canada - the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- will hold talks in the us capital over the weekend .
leaders of the eurozone countries are also scheduled to meet in paris on sunday .
' protect savers ' after friday 's g7 meeting , us treasury secretary henry paulson said the group had a clear vision of what needed doing , and was working together to stabilise the world 's panic-stricken money markets .

henry paulson says " it is critical for governments to provide much needed liquidity " " we are squarely focused on the immediate need to stabilise our financial market and recognise that investor confidence is critical to restore liquidity and enhance the stability of our financial system , " he said .
the five-point plan is intended to protect major banks and financial institutions from failure and ensure they can raise capital from public and private sources .
it includes steps to unfreeze the flow of credit and protect savers , although it did not reveal any specific measures .
it pledged to take " decisive action and use all available tools " to support financial institutions .
it also vowed to take all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets ; ensure banks can raise capital from public as well as private sources ; and ensure national deposit insurance and guarantee programs are robust .
mr paulson said the us was working closely with china and japan - both of which hold large amounts of us treasury bonds - to resolve the crisis .
he added that the us government would buy bank equity .
" we 're going to do it as soon as we can do it and do it effectively , " mr paulson said .
on wednesday , the uk announced it would set aside £ 50bn to buy shares in the nation 's banks .
while the g7 statement identifies the main areas requiring urgent attention , it is short on detail , says the bbc 's andrew walker in washington , adding that much will now depend on how each government takes its own plans forward .
panic-stricken markets earlier on friday , us president george w bush said his government would continue to act to resolve the crisis .
speaking on the white house lawn , mr bush said the recent market turmoil was being driven by " uncertainty and fear " .
but he said the us authorities had a comprehensive strategy and a wide range of tools that they were using " aggressively " to fix the problems .

alaska 's governor sarah palin was accused of sacking a senior state official over a family feud .
but the mccain-palin campaign team said that the report showed mrs palin acted within " proper and lawful authority " .
the report could have an impact on republican hopes of winning next month 's us presidential election .
" i find that governor sarah palin abused her power by violating alaska statute 39.52.110 -lrb- a -rrb- of the alaska executive branch ethics act , " investigator steve branchflower concluded in the panel 's 263-page report .
report 's findings sarah palin abused her power monegan 's refusal to fire wooten was not sole reason for his dismissal , but a contributing factor sarah palin 's acted within her rights as governor of alaska economy could deflect sting mrs palin has always denied any wrongdoing , and her supporters say the charges were motivated by her political opponents .
" this was a partisan-led inquiry run by -lsb- democratic candidate barack -rsb- obama supporters and the palins were completely justified in their concern , " a mccain campaign spokesperson said .
mrs palin was accused of dismissing mr monegan for refusing to sack a state trooper who was in a bitter custody battle with her sister .
the report concluded a family grudge was not the sole reason for the dismissal , but was a likely contributing factor .
however , the report said that the actual sacking of mr monegan was not beyond mrs palin 's legal powers .
speaking after a bipartisan investigating panel reached its decision on what has become known as troopergate , mr monegan said he felt " vindicated " .
" it sounds like they 've validated my belief and opinions , " he said .
" and that tells me i 'm not totally out in left field . "
ethical violation the panel found mrs palin in violation of a state ethics law prohibiting public officials from using their office for personal gain .
i would encourage people to be very cautious , to look at -lsb- the report -rsb- with a jaundiced eye gary stevens republican state senator legislators do not have the power to take formal legal action against the governor ; that would be up to alaska 's personnel board .
if the board decides mrs palin violated state law , the case will be referred to the president of the state senate .
mrs palin 's lawyer said that the report had not been conclusive .
" in order to violate the ethics law , there has to be some personal gain , " said thomas van flein .
" mr branchflower has failed to identify any financial gain . "
and alaskan state senator gary stevens , a republican , said there were " some problems " with the finding .
palin 's supporters say the probe was politically motivated " i would encourage people to be very cautious , to look at this with a jaundiced eye , " said senator stevens , after the report 's release was announced .
several republican politicians had earlier attempted to have the investigation stopped on the grounds that it was politically motivated .
the investigation into the affair began before mr mccain selected mrs palin as his running mate in august .
the us presidential race has now become so polarised both republicans and democrats will likely see the report 's findings as vindication for their own trenchant views about mrs palin , says the bbc 's richard lister in washington .
alaska 's governor will either be seen as the victim of a democratic party hatchet job , or a hypocrite .
most voters , for now at least , seem more concerned about who will extract them from the current economic crisis , rather than any questions about political infighting in far-off alaska , our correspondent adds .
' budget row ' mrs palin maintains she fired mr monegan in july over a budgetary dispute .
but mr monegan said he was dismissed for resisting pressure from mrs palin and her husband , todd , to fire state trooper mike wooten , mrs palin 's former brother-in-law .
mr monegan said he simply wanted the truth to be made known .
sarah palin has denied any wrongdoing over the affair " the governor did want me to fire -lsb- mr wooten -rsb- , and i chose to not , " he told the associated press news agency .
" he did n't do anything under my watch to result in termination . "
todd palin has admitted he did publicise what he called the " injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge " .
but he said his wife , who did not give evidence to the enquiry , then told him to drop the matter .

alaska 's governor sarah palin was accused of sacking a senior state official over a family feud .
but the mccain-palin campaign team said that the report showed mrs palin acted within " proper and lawful authority " .
the report could have an impact on republican hopes of winning next month 's us presidential election .
" i find that governor sarah palin abused her power by violating alaska statute 39.52.110 -lrb- a -rrb- of the alaska executive branch ethics act , " investigator steve branchflower concluded in the panel 's 263-page report .
report 's findings sarah palin abused her power monegan 's refusal to fire wooten was not sole reason for his dismissal , but a contributing factor sarah palin 's acted within her rights as governor of alaska economy could deflect sting mrs palin has always denied any wrongdoing , and her supporters say the charges were motivated by her political opponents .
" this was a partisan-led inquiry run by -lsb- democratic candidate barack -rsb- obama supporters and the palins were completely justified in their concern , " a mccain campaign spokesperson said .
mrs palin was accused of dismissing mr monegan for refusing to sack a state trooper who was in a bitter custody battle with her sister .
the report concluded a family grudge was not the sole reason for the dismissal , but was a likely contributing factor .
however , the report said that the actual sacking of mr monegan was not beyond mrs palin 's legal powers .
speaking after a bipartisan investigating panel reached its decision on what has become known as troopergate , mr monegan said he felt " vindicated " .
" it sounds like they 've validated my belief and opinions , " he said .
" and that tells me i 'm not totally out in left field . "
ethical violation the panel found mrs palin in violation of a state ethics law prohibiting public officials from using their office for personal gain .
i would encourage people to be very cautious , to look at -lsb- the report -rsb- with a jaundiced eye gary stevens republican state senator legislators do not have the power to take formal legal action against the governor ; that would be up to alaska 's personnel board .
if the board decides mrs palin violated state law , the case will be referred to the president of the state senate .
mrs palin 's lawyer said that the report had not been conclusive .
" in order to violate the ethics law , there has to be some personal gain , " said thomas van flein .
" mr branchflower has failed to identify any financial gain . "
and alaskan state senator gary stevens , a republican , said there were " some problems " with the finding .
palin 's supporters say the probe was politically motivated " i would encourage people to be very cautious , to look at this with a jaundiced eye , " said senator stevens , after the report 's release was announced .
several republican politicians had earlier attempted to have the investigation stopped on the grounds that it was politically motivated .
the investigation into the affair began before mr mccain selected mrs palin as his running mate in august .
the us presidential race has now become so polarised both republicans and democrats will likely see the report 's findings as vindication for their own trenchant views about mrs palin , says the bbc 's richard lister in washington .
alaska 's governor will either be seen as the victim of a democratic party hatchet job , or a hypocrite .
most voters , for now at least , seem more concerned about who will extract them from the current economic crisis , rather than any questions about political infighting in far-off alaska , our correspondent adds .
' budget row ' mrs palin maintains she fired mr monegan in july over a budgetary dispute .
but mr monegan said he was dismissed for resisting pressure from mrs palin and her husband , todd , to fire state trooper mike wooten , mrs palin 's former brother-in-law .
mr monegan said he simply wanted the truth to be made known .
sarah palin has denied any wrongdoing over the affair " the governor did want me to fire -lsb- mr wooten -rsb- , and i chose to not , " he told the associated press news agency .
" he did n't do anything under my watch to result in termination . "
todd palin has admitted he did publicise what he called the " injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge " .
but he said his wife , who did not give evidence to the enquiry , then told him to drop the matter .
