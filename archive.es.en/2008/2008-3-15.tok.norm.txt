rediske : it 's created a platform for people , journalists and activists who in the past were denied a voice .
the bar for media production has been lowered .
today , anyone can start a blog and easily send and receive information beyond national borders .
on the other hand , it has also mobilized authorities and governments who do n't tolerate dissenting voices within the media .
they no longer merely impose wide-scale bans , such as in cuba and china .
countries like china can now also avail themselves of technical tools to practice censorship .
according to figures published by your organization , the number of murdered journalists has risen by almost 250 percent in the last five years .
two journalists are arrested every day .
does this reflect the rise of online journalism ?
no .
the number of murdered journalists has risen because of civil war , primarily in iraq , where over 50 percent of journalists have been killed , and afghanistan .
what online journalism has done , however , is trigger greater oppression .
in countries like burma and china , the jails are full .
of the 120 journalists behind bars , 60 are online dissidents .
bildunterschrift : michael rediske is online journalism a threat or a boon to press freedom ?
individuals now have greater scope to be heard .
but there are few possibilities to overcome the information barrier and reach a broad public .
take russia , where there is very little internet censorship because the government feels it is unnecessary given that it controls the television , radio and even the newspapers .
the internet , however , is not really used by very many people .
is there greater press freedom in 2008 than in 1995 , before the internet became a mass medium ?
the fight for press freedom is ongoing .
there is greater press freedom in countries where democratic movements have made progress .
but press freedom can disappear overnight .

" we feel very encouraged at the first meetings of the over-arching process because they have resulted in a drafting process and we hope to give a final product to the president of the un general assembly soon , " he said .
as one of the main candidates for a permanent seat , germany has a vested interest in the outcome .
others include japan , india , brazil and an undetermined african state . germany has long been arguing its right to a seat . the third largest contributor to the un regular budgets , it has also become one of the largest contributors of troops .
german soldiers are engaged in afghanistan , kosovo and bosnia and joined peace missions to cambodia , somalia and the persian gulf .

she called for both the demonstrators and the chinese security forces to show moderation and to respect the rights of individuals .
" a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " the chancellor 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a statement .
the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , is a popular figure in germany .
beijing cancelled a number of high-level meetings with german officials after merkel last year became the first german chancellor to meet with the dalai lama , whom the chinese government views as a separatist . explosive situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government deployed riot police to prevent further protests meanwhile , chinese authorities on saturday deployed troops and tanks in lhasa , demanding that tibetan rioters surrender to police or face more serious punishment for the violence that reportedly claimed dozens of lives following escalating pro-independence protests .
" we have unconfirmed reports that about 100 people have been killed and martial law imposed in lhasa , " the tibetan government-in-exile , based in the indian city of dharamsala , said in a statement .
us-based radio free asia on saturday also quoted tibetans in lhasa as saying up to 80 people could have died in the rioting .
" there could be about 80 dead , or more , but there is too much commotion here to give an exact number , " the broadcaster quoted one tibetan witness as saying .
china acknowledges protests state television on saturday broadcast its first footage of the rioting , showing burning buildings and vehicles , and groups of protesters breaking into shops apparently unchallenged by police .
" the outbreak of violence died down in lhasa friday night , after a tumultuous day that saw windows smashed , shops robbed , a mosque burnt down and reportedly many casualties , " the government 's official xinhua news agency said .
bildunterschrift : china wants to make sure that its grip on tibet remains as tight as possible the agency quoted officials as saying that at least 10 " innocent civilians , " including two hotel employees and two shop owners , had died in some of the 60 fires recorded in the city on friday .
" the number of injured and other losses kept rising " and " many policemen on duty were badly injured , " it said without elaborating .
paramilitary police rescued some 580 people , including three japanese tourists , from banks , supermarkets , schools and hospitals that were set alight , it said .

rediske : it 's created a platform for people , journalists and activists who in the past were denied a voice .
the bar for media production has been lowered .
today , anyone can start a blog and easily send and receive information beyond national borders .
on the other hand , it has also mobilized authorities and governments who do n't tolerate dissenting voices within the media .
they no longer merely impose wide-scale bans , such as in cuba and china .
countries like china can now also avail themselves of technical tools to practice censorship .
according to figures published by your organization , the number of murdered journalists has risen by almost 250 percent in the last five years .
two journalists are arrested every day .
does this reflect the rise of online journalism ?
no .
the number of murdered journalists has risen because of civil war , primarily in iraq , where over 50 percent of journalists have been killed , and afghanistan .
what online journalism has done , however , is trigger greater oppression .

she called for both the demonstrators and the chinese security forces to show moderation and to respect the rights of individuals .
" a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " the chancellor 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a statement .
the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , is a popular figure in germany .
beijing cancelled a number of high-level meetings with german officials after merkel last year became the first german chancellor to meet with the dalai lama , whom the chinese government views as a separatist . explosive situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government deployed riot police to prevent further protests meanwhile , chinese authorities on saturday deployed troops and tanks in lhasa , demanding that tibetan rioters surrender to police or face more serious punishment for the violence that reportedly claimed dozens of lives following escalating pro-independence protests .
" we have unconfirmed reports that about 100 people have been killed and martial law imposed in lhasa , " the tibetan government-in-exile , based in the indian city of dharamsala , said in a statement .
us-based radio free asia on saturday also quoted tibetans in lhasa as saying up to 80 people could have died in the rioting .
" there could be about 80 dead , or more , but there is too much commotion here to give an exact number , " the broadcaster quoted one tibetan witness as saying .
china acknowledges protests state television on saturday broadcast its first footage of the rioting , showing burning buildings and vehicles , and groups of protesters breaking into shops apparently unchallenged by police .
" the outbreak of violence died down in lhasa friday night , after a tumultuous day that saw windows smashed , shops robbed , a mosque burnt down and reportedly many casualties , " the government 's official xinhua news agency said .
bildunterschrift : china wants to make sure that its grip on tibet remains as tight as possible the agency quoted officials as saying that at least 10 " innocent civilians , " including two hotel employees and two shop owners , had died in some of the 60 fires recorded in the city on friday .

rediske : it 's created a platform for people , journalists and activists who in the past were denied a voice .
the bar for media production has been lowered .
today , anyone can start a blog and easily send and receive information beyond national borders .
on the other hand , it has also mobilized authorities and governments who do n't tolerate dissenting voices within the media .
they no longer merely impose wide-scale bans , such as in cuba and china .
countries like china can now also avail themselves of technical tools to practice censorship .
according to figures published by your organization , the number of murdered journalists has risen by almost 250 percent in the last five years .
two journalists are arrested every day .
does this reflect the rise of online journalism ?
no .
the number of murdered journalists has risen because of civil war , primarily in iraq , where over 50 percent of journalists have been killed , and afghanistan .
what online journalism has done , however , is trigger greater oppression .
in countries like burma and china , the jails are full .

individuals now have greater scope to be heard .

the internet , however , is not really used by very many people .
is there greater press freedom in 2008 than in 1995 , before the internet became a mass medium ?
the fight for press freedom is ongoing .

she called for both the demonstrators and the chinese security forces to show moderation and to respect the rights of individuals .
" a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " the chancellor 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a statement .
the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , is a popular figure in germany .
beijing cancelled a number of high-level meetings with german officials after merkel last year became the first german chancellor to meet with the dalai lama , whom the chinese government views as a separatist . explosive situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government deployed riot police to prevent further protests meanwhile , chinese authorities on saturday deployed troops and tanks in lhasa , demanding that tibetan rioters surrender to police or face more serious punishment for the violence that reportedly claimed dozens of lives following escalating pro-independence protests .
" we have unconfirmed reports that about 100 people have been killed and martial law imposed in lhasa , " the tibetan government-in-exile , based in the indian city of dharamsala , said in a statement .
us-based radio free asia on saturday also quoted tibetans in lhasa as saying up to 80 people could have died in the rioting .
" there could be about 80 dead , or more , but there is too much commotion here to give an exact number , " the broadcaster quoted one tibetan witness as saying .
china acknowledges protests state television on saturday broadcast its first footage of the rioting , showing burning buildings and vehicles , and groups of protesters breaking into shops apparently unchallenged by police .
" the outbreak of violence died down in lhasa friday night , after a tumultuous day that saw windows smashed , shops robbed , a mosque burnt down and reportedly many casualties , " the government 's official xinhua news agency said .
bildunterschrift : china wants to make sure that its grip on tibet remains as tight as possible the agency quoted officials as saying that at least 10 " innocent civilians , " including two hotel employees and two shop owners , had died in some of the 60 fires recorded in the city on friday .
" the number of injured and other losses kept rising " and " many policemen on duty were badly injured , " it said without elaborating .
paramilitary police rescued some 580 people , including three japanese tourists , from banks , supermarkets , schools and hospitals that were set alight , it said .
the rioters would be treated leniently if they turned themselves in by midnight on monday , and unspecified rewards and protection would be given to anyone providing information on the violence , said a joint notice from the high court , police and state prosecutors in the tibet autonomous region .
germany rejects separatist aims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered in front of the chinese embassy in berlin on saturday germany remains committed to religious and cultural autonomy for the himalayan territory but is equally committed to a one-china policy that rejected any separatist aims , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
on monday , around 920 german cities and towns hoisted the tibetan flag to back the territory 's demand for cultural autonomy .
the day was chosen to mark the 49th anniversary of the tibetan uprising against china , which seized the himalayan country in 1950-51 .
on friday the german foreign ministry issued a travel warning for tibet in response to the protests .
" in view of the unclear situation , the foreign ministry advises against travel to the autonomous region of tibet , " a spokesman said .
friday 's rioting followed protests by tibetan monks that began monday , the 49th anniversary of an uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops .
the protests have since spread to several other monasteries in other tibetan areas of china . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we feel very encouraged at the first meetings of the over-arching process because they have resulted in a drafting process and we hope to give a final product to the president of the un general assembly soon , " he said .
as one of the main candidates for a permanent seat , germany has a vested interest in the outcome .
others include japan , india , brazil and an undetermined african state . germany has long been arguing its right to a seat . the third largest contributor to the un regular budgets , it has also become one of the largest contributors of troops .
german soldiers are engaged in afghanistan , kosovo and bosnia and joined peace missions to cambodia , somalia and the persian gulf .
moreover , german diplomacy plays a constructive role on the international stage . anachronistic but while germany 's bid is supported by japan , india , brazil , france , the united kingdom and russia , among other countries , italy , for example , firmly opposes it . against the backdrop of such disagreement , diplomats said that even if negotiations on expanding the council get under way , there is no guarantee they will succeed . the council is currently made up of five permanent members with veto rights - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , considered the victors of world war two - while 10 non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms according to regions . reform is , however , long overdue .

she called for both the demonstrators and the chinese security forces to show moderation and to respect the rights of individuals .
" a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " the chancellor 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a statement .
the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , is a popular figure in germany .
beijing cancelled a number of high-level meetings with german officials after merkel last year became the first german chancellor to meet with the dalai lama , whom the chinese government views as a separatist . explosive situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government deployed riot police to prevent further protests meanwhile , chinese authorities on saturday deployed troops and tanks in lhasa , demanding that tibetan rioters surrender to police or face more serious punishment for the violence that reportedly claimed dozens of lives following escalating pro-independence protests .
" we have unconfirmed reports that about 100 people have been killed and martial law imposed in lhasa , " the tibetan government-in-exile , based in the indian city of dharamsala , said in a statement .
us-based radio free asia on saturday also quoted tibetans in lhasa as saying up to 80 people could have died in the rioting .
" there could be about 80 dead , or more , but there is too much commotion here to give an exact number , " the broadcaster quoted one tibetan witness as saying .
china acknowledges protests state television on saturday broadcast its first footage of the rioting , showing burning buildings and vehicles , and groups of protesters breaking into shops apparently unchallenged by police .
" the outbreak of violence died down in lhasa friday night , after a tumultuous day that saw windows smashed , shops robbed , a mosque burnt down and reportedly many casualties , " the government 's official xinhua news agency said .
bildunterschrift : china wants to make sure that its grip on tibet remains as tight as possible the agency quoted officials as saying that at least 10 " innocent civilians , " including two hotel employees and two shop owners , had died in some of the 60 fires recorded in the city on friday .
" the number of injured and other losses kept rising " and " many policemen on duty were badly injured , " it said without elaborating .
paramilitary police rescued some 580 people , including three japanese tourists , from banks , supermarkets , schools and hospitals that were set alight , it said .
the rioters would be treated leniently if they turned themselves in by midnight on monday , and unspecified rewards and protection would be given to anyone providing information on the violence , said a joint notice from the high court , police and state prosecutors in the tibet autonomous region .
germany rejects separatist aims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered in front of the chinese embassy in berlin on saturday germany remains committed to religious and cultural autonomy for the himalayan territory but is equally committed to a one-china policy that rejected any separatist aims , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
on monday , around 920 german cities and towns hoisted the tibetan flag to back the territory 's demand for cultural autonomy .
the day was chosen to mark the 49th anniversary of the tibetan uprising against china , which seized the himalayan country in 1950-51 .
on friday the german foreign ministry issued a travel warning for tibet in response to the protests .
" in view of the unclear situation , the foreign ministry advises against travel to the autonomous region of tibet , " a spokesman said .
friday 's rioting followed protests by tibetan monks that began monday , the 49th anniversary of an uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops .
the protests have since spread to several other monasteries in other tibetan areas of china . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " the chancellor 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a statement .
the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , is a popular figure in germany .
beijing cancelled a number of high-level meetings with german officials after merkel last year became the first german chancellor to meet with the dalai lama , whom the chinese government views as a separatist . explosive situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government deployed riot police to prevent further protests meanwhile , chinese authorities on saturday deployed troops and tanks in lhasa , demanding that tibetan rioters surrender to police or face more serious punishment for the violence that reportedly claimed dozens of lives following escalating pro-independence protests .
" we have unconfirmed reports that about 100 people have been killed and martial law imposed in lhasa , " the tibetan government-in-exile , based in the indian city of dharamsala , said in a statement .
us-based radio free asia on saturday also quoted tibetans in lhasa as saying up to 80 people could have died in the rioting .
" there could be about 80 dead , or more , but there is too much commotion here to give an exact number , " the broadcaster quoted one tibetan witness as saying .
china acknowledges protests state television on saturday broadcast its first footage of the rioting , showing burning buildings and vehicles , and groups of protesters breaking into shops apparently unchallenged by police .
" the outbreak of violence died down in lhasa friday night , after a tumultuous day that saw windows smashed , shops robbed , a mosque burnt down and reportedly many casualties , " the government 's official xinhua news agency said .
bildunterschrift : china wants to make sure that its grip on tibet remains as tight as possible the agency quoted officials as saying that at least 10 " innocent civilians , " including two hotel employees and two shop owners , had died in some of the 60 fires recorded in the city on friday .
" the number of injured and other losses kept rising " and " many policemen on duty were badly injured , " it said without elaborating .
paramilitary police rescued some 580 people , including three japanese tourists , from banks , supermarkets , schools and hospitals that were set alight , it said .
the rioters would be treated leniently if they turned themselves in by midnight on monday , and unspecified rewards and protection would be given to anyone providing information on the violence , said a joint notice from the high court , police and state prosecutors in the tibet autonomous region .
germany rejects separatist aims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered in front of the chinese embassy in berlin on saturday germany remains committed to religious and cultural autonomy for the himalayan territory but is equally committed to a one-china policy that rejected any separatist aims , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
on monday , around 920 german cities and towns hoisted the tibetan flag to back the territory 's demand for cultural autonomy .
the day was chosen to mark the 49th anniversary of the tibetan uprising against china , which seized the himalayan country in 1950-51 .
on friday the german foreign ministry issued a travel warning for tibet in response to the protests .
" in view of the unclear situation , the foreign ministry advises against travel to the autonomous region of tibet , " a spokesman said .
friday 's rioting followed protests by tibetan monks that began monday , the 49th anniversary of an uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops .
the protests have since spread to several other monasteries in other tibetan areas of china . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the composition of the 15-nation watchdog of international peace and security has become outdated and should adapt to the new world order . even if negotiations do succeed and the general assembly agrees to expand the council within the year , experts say it would take up to three years for member states to ratify the plan . german ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke in new york last september after german reunification in 1990 , the government stepped up its efforts to secure a permanent seat on the security council . the campaign gained unprecedented momentum under the previous government , with former chancellor gerhard schroeder coordinating a push for inclusion with the governments of japan , brazil and india . in september 2007 , chancellor angela merkel raised the issue once again when she spoke at the united nations general assembly .

she called for both the demonstrators and the chinese security forces to show moderation and to respect the rights of individuals .
" a lasting solution to the tibet question can perhaps only be found through a peaceful and direct dialogue between the chinese government and the dalai lama , " the chancellor 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a statement .
the tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , who lives in exile in india , is a popular figure in germany .
beijing cancelled a number of high-level meetings with german officials after merkel last year became the first german chancellor to meet with the dalai lama , whom the chinese government views as a separatist . explosive situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government deployed riot police to prevent further protests meanwhile , chinese authorities on saturday deployed troops and tanks in lhasa , demanding that tibetan rioters surrender to police or face more serious punishment for the violence that reportedly claimed dozens of lives following escalating pro-independence protests .
" we have unconfirmed reports that about 100 people have been killed and martial law imposed in lhasa , " the tibetan government-in-exile , based in the indian city of dharamsala , said in a statement .
us-based radio free asia on saturday also quoted tibetans in lhasa as saying up to 80 people could have died in the rioting .
" there could be about 80 dead , or more , but there is too much commotion here to give an exact number , " the broadcaster quoted one tibetan witness as saying .
china acknowledges protests state television on saturday broadcast its first footage of the rioting , showing burning buildings and vehicles , and groups of protesters breaking into shops apparently unchallenged by police .
" the outbreak of violence died down in lhasa friday night , after a tumultuous day that saw windows smashed , shops robbed , a mosque burnt down and reportedly many casualties , " the government 's official xinhua news agency said .
bildunterschrift : china wants to make sure that its grip on tibet remains as tight as possible the agency quoted officials as saying that at least 10 " innocent civilians , " including two hotel employees and two shop owners , had died in some of the 60 fires recorded in the city on friday .
" the number of injured and other losses kept rising " and " many policemen on duty were badly injured , " it said without elaborating .
paramilitary police rescued some 580 people , including three japanese tourists , from banks , supermarkets , schools and hospitals that were set alight , it said .
the rioters would be treated leniently if they turned themselves in by midnight on monday , and unspecified rewards and protection would be given to anyone providing information on the violence , said a joint notice from the high court , police and state prosecutors in the tibet autonomous region .
germany rejects separatist aims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors gathered in front of the chinese embassy in berlin on saturday germany remains committed to religious and cultural autonomy for the himalayan territory but is equally committed to a one-china policy that rejected any separatist aims , merkel 's spokesman ulrich wilhelm said .
on monday , around 920 german cities and towns hoisted the tibetan flag to back the territory 's demand for cultural autonomy .
the day was chosen to mark the 49th anniversary of the tibetan uprising against china , which seized the himalayan country in 1950-51 .
on friday the german foreign ministry issued a travel warning for tibet in response to the protests .
" in view of the unclear situation , the foreign ministry advises against travel to the autonomous region of tibet , " a spokesman said .
friday 's rioting followed protests by tibetan monks that began monday , the 49th anniversary of an uprising against chinese rule that was crushed by troops .
the protests have since spread to several other monasteries in other tibetan areas of china . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we feel very encouraged at the first meetings of the over-arching process because they have resulted in a drafting process and we hope to give a final product to the president of the un general assembly soon , " he said .
as one of the main candidates for a permanent seat , germany has a vested interest in the outcome .
others include japan , india , brazil and an undetermined african state . germany has long been arguing its right to a seat . the third largest contributor to the un regular budgets , it has also become one of the largest contributors of troops .
german soldiers are engaged in afghanistan , kosovo and bosnia and joined peace missions to cambodia , somalia and the persian gulf .
moreover , german diplomacy plays a constructive role on the international stage . anachronistic but while germany 's bid is supported by japan , india , brazil , france , the united kingdom and russia , among other countries , italy , for example , firmly opposes it . against the backdrop of such disagreement , diplomats said that even if negotiations on expanding the council get under way , there is no guarantee they will succeed . the council is currently made up of five permanent members with veto rights - britain , china , france , russia and the united states , considered the victors of world war two - while 10 non-permanent members are elected for two-year terms according to regions . reform is , however , long overdue .
critics say the composition of the 15-nation watchdog of international peace and security has become outdated and should adapt to the new world order . even if negotiations do succeed and the general assembly agrees to expand the council within the year , experts say it would take up to three years for member states to ratify the plan . german ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel spoke in new york last september after german reunification in 1990 , the government stepped up its efforts to secure a permanent seat on the security council . the campaign gained unprecedented momentum under the previous government , with former chancellor gerhard schroeder coordinating a push for inclusion with the governments of japan , brazil and india . in september 2007 , chancellor angela merkel raised the issue once again when she spoke at the united nations general assembly . " germany is ready to take more responsibility with the assumption of a permanent seat on the security council , " she said , emphasizing that the current composition of the security council no longer reflects today 's world .

rediske : it 's created a platform for people , journalists and activists who in the past were denied a voice .
the bar for media production has been lowered .
today , anyone can start a blog and easily send and receive information beyond national borders .
on the other hand , it has also mobilized authorities and governments who do n't tolerate dissenting voices within the media .
they no longer merely impose wide-scale bans , such as in cuba and china .
countries like china can now also avail themselves of technical tools to practice censorship .
according to figures published by your organization , the number of murdered journalists has risen by almost 250 percent in the last five years .
two journalists are arrested every day .
does this reflect the rise of online journalism ?
no .
the number of murdered journalists has risen because of civil war , primarily in iraq , where over 50 percent of journalists have been killed , and afghanistan .
what online journalism has done , however , is trigger greater oppression .
in countries like burma and china , the jails are full .
of the 120 journalists behind bars , 60 are online dissidents .
bildunterschrift : michael rediske is online journalism a threat or a boon to press freedom ?
individuals now have greater scope to be heard .
but there are few possibilities to overcome the information barrier and reach a broad public .
take russia , where there is very little internet censorship because the government feels it is unnecessary given that it controls the television , radio and even the newspapers .
the internet , however , is not really used by very many people .
is there greater press freedom in 2008 than in 1995 , before the internet became a mass medium ?

rediske : it 's created a platform for people , journalists and activists who in the past were denied a voice .
the bar for media production has been lowered .
today , anyone can start a blog and easily send and receive information beyond national borders .
on the other hand , it has also mobilized authorities and governments who do n't tolerate dissenting voices within the media .
they no longer merely impose wide-scale bans , such as in cuba and china .
countries like china can now also avail themselves of technical tools to practice censorship .
according to figures published by your organization , the number of murdered journalists has risen by almost 250 percent in the last five years .
two journalists are arrested every day .
does this reflect the rise of online journalism ?
no .
the number of murdered journalists has risen because of civil war , primarily in iraq , where over 50 percent of journalists have been killed , and afghanistan .
what online journalism has done , however , is trigger greater oppression .
in countries like burma and china , the jails are full .
of the 120 journalists behind bars , 60 are online dissidents .
bildunterschrift : michael rediske is online journalism a threat or a boon to press freedom ?
individuals now have greater scope to be heard .
but there are few possibilities to overcome the information barrier and reach a broad public .
take russia , where there is very little internet censorship because the government feels it is unnecessary given that it controls the television , radio and even the newspapers .
the internet , however , is not really used by very many people .
is there greater press freedom in 2008 than in 1995 , before the internet became a mass medium ?
the fight for press freedom is ongoing .
there is greater press freedom in countries where democratic movements have made progress .
but press freedom can disappear overnight .
there 's no clear-cut answer to this question . oliver samson interviewed michael rediske -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rediske : it 's created a platform for people , journalists and activists who in the past were denied a voice .
the bar for media production has been lowered .
today , anyone can start a blog and easily send and receive information beyond national borders .
on the other hand , it has also mobilized authorities and governments who do n't tolerate dissenting voices within the media .
they no longer merely impose wide-scale bans , such as in cuba and china .
countries like china can now also avail themselves of technical tools to practice censorship .
according to figures published by your organization , the number of murdered journalists has risen by almost 250 percent in the last five years .
two journalists are arrested every day .
does this reflect the rise of online journalism ?
no .
the number of murdered journalists has risen because of civil war , primarily in iraq , where over 50 percent of journalists have been killed , and afghanistan .
what online journalism has done , however , is trigger greater oppression .
in countries like burma and china , the jails are full .
of the 120 journalists behind bars , 60 are online dissidents .
bildunterschrift : michael rediske is online journalism a threat or a boon to press freedom ?
individuals now have greater scope to be heard .
but there are few possibilities to overcome the information barrier and reach a broad public .
take russia , where there is very little internet censorship because the government feels it is unnecessary given that it controls the television , radio and even the newspapers .
the internet , however , is not really used by very many people .
is there greater press freedom in 2008 than in 1995 , before the internet became a mass medium ?
the fight for press freedom is ongoing .
there is greater press freedom in countries where democratic movements have made progress .
but press freedom can disappear overnight .
there 's no clear-cut answer to this question . oliver samson interviewed michael rediske -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

water bills are set to rise by about 6 % across england and wales .
water regulator ofwat says water meters could be a solution for some customers to help them cut costs .
the government is to review water supplies and charges , which may mean compulsory meters where water is in scarce supply .
" fairer system " the minister , phil woolas , told the bbc the government wanted to bring in a fairer system .
" those that do n't have meters - if they 're in small households , small families - are in effect subsidising the people with meters , and that is something that we are looking to change , so that we can have a fairer system " , he said .
the bbc 's sarah pennells said that there are about two million flats where it would be difficult to install water meters , because it would involve separating a shared water supply .
ofwat says the impending increase , which householders start paying from april , will make the average bill -lrb- for water and sewage treatment -rrb- £ 330 a year .
this means a rise of about £ 18 .
but the combined bill rise is nearly 8 % in some areas .
last year 's average price increase was 7 % .
read a selection of your comments on this story : older maisonettes ca n't get meters either .
when i got an offer for a meter and realised just how much i would save .
i live alone and am out all day at work , i tried to get one , but the paperwork wo n't allow it .
jenny , s.london i am a single male living in a council flat .
i would not be able to have a water meter here .
i am paying the same price as a large family for my water , whereas a large family would use at least five times the amount of water i do .
is this fair ?
of course , no-one is interested in helping single people with no dependants ... it 's all about helping families .
keith lewis , birmingham i have not got a meter and do n't want one .
-lrb- though i pay more than £ 500 pa , i am definitely subsidising those who do and i strongly object to the coercion -rrb- .
metering is a retrograde step towards an unwanted -lrb- further -rrb- overregulated , over controlling society .
it costs more than £ 1000 to install a single meter .
so how long will that take to recover in your bill ?
more relevantly : if the water companies spent £ 1000 per customer on fixing leak there would be no problem to solve anyway .
jim , swindon i am 65 yrs old and live alone on state pension in a semi detached 2 bed property .
i had a water meter installed nine months ago and the saving has been in the order of 65 % .
together with prudent use of water , washing up once a day , showers instead of baths and using washing machine for full loads only this action has been very beneficial to my overall financial situation .

outrageous .
julia , london you do n't only pay for the water you use .
you also pay for the water companies ' leaks .
they never repair those properly because it would divert money from the shareholders and anyway they still get away with blaming the victorians .
james , taunton we moved from a house with no meter to one with a meter .
it does make me think more about the water i am using , as i know every litre costs me money .
with increasing demand for water the only fair solution is for everyone to be metered .
this will deliver real savings and stimulate the market to produce further water-saving devices and technologies for the home .
we would n't dream of paying for our petrol on an unmetered basis so why should water be any different ?
gary herring , redhill how can the government minister have got it so wrong ?
it 's the people in large households without meters who are being subsidised .
people with meters are paying their fair share .

water bills are set to rise by about 6 % across england and wales .
water regulator ofwat says water meters could be a solution for some customers to help them cut costs .
the government is to review water supplies and charges , which may mean compulsory meters where water is in scarce supply .
" fairer system " the minister , phil woolas , told the bbc the government wanted to bring in a fairer system .
" those that do n't have meters - if they 're in small households , small families - are in effect subsidising the people with meters , and that is something that we are looking to change , so that we can have a fairer system " , he said .
the bbc 's sarah pennells said that there are about two million flats where it would be difficult to install water meters , because it would involve separating a shared water supply .
ofwat says the impending increase , which householders start paying from april , will make the average bill -lrb- for water and sewage treatment -rrb- £ 330 a year .
this means a rise of about £ 18 .
but the combined bill rise is nearly 8 % in some areas .
last year 's average price increase was 7 % .
read a selection of your comments on this story : older maisonettes ca n't get meters either .
when i got an offer for a meter and realised just how much i would save .
i live alone and am out all day at work , i tried to get one , but the paperwork wo n't allow it .
jenny , s.london i am a single male living in a council flat .
i would not be able to have a water meter here .
i am paying the same price as a large family for my water , whereas a large family would use at least five times the amount of water i do .
is this fair ?
of course , no-one is interested in helping single people with no dependants ... it 's all about helping families .
keith lewis , birmingham i have not got a meter and do n't want one .
-lrb- though i pay more than £ 500 pa , i am definitely subsidising those who do and i strongly object to the coercion -rrb- .
metering is a retrograde step towards an unwanted -lrb- further -rrb- overregulated , over controlling society .
it costs more than £ 1000 to install a single meter .
so how long will that take to recover in your bill ?
more relevantly : if the water companies spent £ 1000 per customer on fixing leak there would be no problem to solve anyway .
jim , swindon i am 65 yrs old and live alone on state pension in a semi detached 2 bed property .
i had a water meter installed nine months ago and the saving has been in the order of 65 % .
together with prudent use of water , washing up once a day , showers instead of baths and using washing machine for full loads only this action has been very beneficial to my overall financial situation .

water regulator ofwat says water meters could be a solution for some customers to help them cut costs .
the government is to review water supplies and charges , which may mean compulsory meters where water is in scarce supply .
" fairer system " the minister , phil woolas , told the bbc the government wanted to bring in a fairer system .
" those that do n't have meters - if they 're in small households , small families - are in effect subsidising the people with meters , and that is something that we are looking to change , so that we can have a fairer system " , he said .
the bbc 's sarah pennells said that there are about two million flats where it would be difficult to install water meters , because it would involve separating a shared water supply .
ofwat says the impending increase , which householders start paying from april , will make the average bill -lrb- for water and sewage treatment -rrb- £ 330 a year .
this means a rise of about £ 18 .
but the combined bill rise is nearly 8 % in some areas .
last year 's average price increase was 7 % .
read a selection of your comments on this story : older maisonettes ca n't get meters either .
when i got an offer for a meter and realised just how much i would save .
i live alone and am out all day at work , i tried to get one , but the paperwork wo n't allow it .
jenny , s.london i am a single male living in a council flat .
i would not be able to have a water meter here .
i am paying the same price as a large family for my water , whereas a large family would use at least five times the amount of water i do .
is this fair ?
of course , no-one is interested in helping single people with no dependants ... it 's all about helping families .
keith lewis , birmingham i have not got a meter and do n't want one .
-lrb- though i pay more than £ 500 pa , i am definitely subsidising those who do and i strongly object to the coercion -rrb- .
metering is a retrograde step towards an unwanted -lrb- further -rrb- overregulated , over controlling society .
it costs more than £ 1000 to install a single meter .
so how long will that take to recover in your bill ?
more relevantly : if the water companies spent £ 1000 per customer on fixing leak there would be no problem to solve anyway .
jim , swindon i am 65 yrs old and live alone on state pension in a semi detached 2 bed property .
i had a water meter installed nine months ago and the saving has been in the order of 65 % .
together with prudent use of water , washing up once a day , showers instead of baths and using washing machine for full loads only this action has been very beneficial to my overall financial situation .
peter winfield , leeds how can water companies justify an above inflation increase when they are making record profits year on year .
stuart evans , wigan our un-metered water / sewage charge was £ 500 .
now that we have a meter it is £ 195 per year .
we now collect water from the roof for the garden .
ian young , spencers wood , reading the problem with water is it 's based on the council tax bands .
if i go to tesco i pay the same as everyone else for whatever i buy but with water you pay on the value of your home .
petrol , food , gas , electric we all pay the same except for water .
its time there was a flat rate for everyone for water as it 's something you can not do without .
les watson , swansea i have just received my water bills for next year and they have gone up 10 % , how can they justify the increase , my wage goes up on ave 3 % per annum how can i afford to pay for this unjustifiable increase , its daylight robbery ! ! ! ! ! ! !
mark storey , carnforth , lancashire these comments are a further attack by the government on large families .
in the end only the very rich will be able to afford to have more than two children .
outrageous .
julia , london you do n't only pay for the water you use .
you also pay for the water companies ' leaks .
they never repair those properly because it would divert money from the shareholders and anyway they still get away with blaming the victorians .
james , taunton we moved from a house with no meter to one with a meter .
it does make me think more about the water i am using , as i know every litre costs me money .
with increasing demand for water the only fair solution is for everyone to be metered .
this will deliver real savings and stimulate the market to produce further water-saving devices and technologies for the home .
we would n't dream of paying for our petrol on an unmetered basis so why should water be any different ?
gary herring , redhill how can the government minister have got it so wrong ?
it 's the people in large households without meters who are being subsidised .
people with meters are paying their fair share .

baa , owned by the spanish company ferrovial , runs london 's heathrow , gatwick and stansted airports , glasgow , edinburgh , aberdeen and southampton .
mps said baa 's dominance is " bad for passengers " and the aviation industry .
baa said a break-up would only delay " the provision of extra runway and terminal capacity " .
the company serves almost 150m passengers a year and opened heathrow 's new terminal 5 on friday .
expansion supported but the report by the house of commons transport committee said baa had " mismanaged resources " and competition was being " stifled by common ownership of several major airports " .
this , it said , resulted in the natural development of the market being " held back " . "
ending baa 's common ownership will encourage airports to compete for traffic " gwyneth dunwoody mp the report said : " baa may feel as though it is taking a lot of the flak for things that are not part of its day-to-day responsibility , but this does not detract from the serious questions raised over mismanagement of resources and failure to plan adequately for contingencies which were far from unexpected , let alone inconceivable .
" with the ever-present possibility of extraordinary circumstances such as strikes or terrorist incidents , queues at airports are almost inevitable from time to time .
" our criticism of baa is that it should have predicted the predictable and planned accordingly .
" baa 's monopoly position in the uk airports sector is unnecessary .
indeed , it is bad for passengers and bad for the aviation industry .
" we do not agree that the status quo is a necessary condition of sustained investment and development . "
' huge benefits ' the committee 's chairman , gwyneth dunwoody mp , said there was room for more competition , particularly between london airports .
" baa airports account for such a large proportion of air travel , and the company 's future is of central importance to the uk 's transport infrastructure , " she said .
" ending baa 's common ownership will encourage airports to compete for traffic .
the committee firmly believes that increased competition is possible and could have huge benefits for both airlines and passengers . "
the committee did add its support for the government 's proposals to expand heathrow , which could lead to a third runway and a sixth terminal .
baa , which runs seven uk airports in total , said breaking up the company would only bring delays to improvements for the country 's aviation .
it said : " we firmly believe that a break-up would only delay not just the much-needed investment , but also what the government , and the committee itself in this latest report , have consistently identified as the overwhelming priority in the south east of england since the 2003 -lrb- aviation -rrb- white paper - the provision of extra runway and terminal capacity . "
another member of the transport select committee , graham stringer , said passengers were getting a bad deal because of baa 's monopoly .
he said the company had grown lazy .
" when you talk to the airlines , when you talk to passengers : they 're getting very poor quality service because baa do n't have to compete with anybody .
" so that 's bad on that side of the equation , but where baa do have to compete with international airports like charles de gaulle , schiphol , copenhagen , they are losing ground to them " , mr stringer said .
criticism rejected baa 's director of corporate and public affairs , tom kelly , defended its customer service record .
he told the bbc that baa needed to be able to expand services in order to improve them .
" the key problem is not lack of competition .
the key problem , as the committee itself acknowledges , is lack of capacity " , mr kelly said .
" this week we have opened t5 -lsb- heathrow terminal 5 -rsb- .
we have also ... lodged an application for a new runway at stansted .
nobody else is prepared to make that kind of long-term commitment .
" i defy anybody who looked at the pictures of terminal 5 yesterday to suggest that we do n't value quality of service " , mr kelly said .

baa , owned by the spanish company ferrovial , runs london 's heathrow , gatwick and stansted airports , glasgow , edinburgh , aberdeen and southampton .
mps said baa 's dominance is " bad for passengers " and the aviation industry .
baa said a break-up would only delay " the provision of extra runway and terminal capacity " .
the company serves almost 150m passengers a year and opened heathrow 's new terminal 5 on friday .
expansion supported but the report by the house of commons transport committee said baa had " mismanaged resources " and competition was being " stifled by common ownership of several major airports " .
this , it said , resulted in the natural development of the market being " held back " .
ending baa 's common ownership will encourage airports to compete for traffic gwyneth dunwoody mp the report said : " baa may feel as though it is taking a lot of the flak for things that are not part of its day-to-day responsibility , but this does not detract from the serious questions raised over mismanagement of resources and failure to plan adequately for contingencies which were far from unexpected , let alone inconceivable .
" with the ever-present possibility of extraordinary circumstances such as strikes or terrorist incidents , queues at airports are almost inevitable from time to time .
" our criticism of baa is that it should have predicted the predictable and planned accordingly .
" baa 's monopoly position in the uk airports sector is unnecessary .
indeed , it is bad for passengers and bad for the aviation industry .
" we do not agree that the status quo is a necessary condition of sustained investment and development . "
' huge benefits ' the committee 's chairman , gwyneth dunwoody mp , said there was room for more competition , particularly between london airports .
" baa airports account for such a large proportion of air travel , and the company 's future is of central importance to the uk 's transport infrastructure , " she said .
" ending baa 's common ownership will encourage airports to compete for traffic .
the committee firmly believes that increased competition is possible and could have huge benefits for both airlines and passengers . "
the committee did add its support for the government 's proposals to expand heathrow , which could lead to a third runway and a sixth terminal .
baa , which runs seven uk airports in total , said breaking up the company would only bring delays to improvements for the country 's aviation .
it said : " we firmly believe that a break-up would only delay not just the much-needed investment , but also what the government , and the committee itself in this latest report , have consistently identified as the overwhelming priority in the south east of england since the 2003 -lrb- aviation -rrb- white paper - the provision of extra runway and terminal capacity . "
another member of the transport select committee , graham stringer , said passengers were getting a bad deal because of baa 's monopoly .
he said the company had grown lazy .
" when you talk to the airlines , when you talk to passengers : they 're getting very poor quality service because baa do n't have to compete with anybody .
" so that 's bad on that side of the equation , but where baa do have to compete with international airports like charles de gaulle , schiphol , copenhagen , they are losing ground to them " , mr stringer said .
criticism rejected baa 's director of corporate and public affairs , tom kelly , defended its customer service record .
he told the bbc that baa needed to be able to expand services in order to improve them .
" the key problem is not lack of competition .
the key problem , as the committee itself acknowledges , is lack of capacity " , mr kelly said .
" this week we have opened t5 -lsb- heathrow terminal 5 -rsb- .
we have also ... lodged an application for a new runway at stansted .

it has the highest population density of any nation on the planet ; and a half of its people are without adequate sanitation .
as a result , the rivers and fields are polluted with human waste that enters the food chain .
according to figures from water aid , 125,000 children under the age of five die each year from diarrhoeal diseases .
" in one year , 140 people died in this village from diarrhoea ; we saw it with our own eyes , " a bangladeshi man tells the television trust for the environment 's -lrb- tve -rrb- earth report programme .
" they all died within 15 to 20 days , and people who used to dig their graves had their lunch beside the graves because they did not have time to go home . "
help yourselves the floodplains of bangladesh are considered to be among the most fertile soils in the world .
however , the reason behind the richness of the land is also a major threat for the rice farmers who grow their crops here .
for up to six months each year , the fields are covered by water , which increases the risk of diseases like cholera .
to stop the spread of diseases , an awareness raising scheme called community led total sanitation -lrb- clts -rrb- is helping local people to help themselves .
" in the clts approach , the solutions are not imposed from the outside and the community is not told what to do , " explains clts founder kamal kar .
" the community is empowered and the solutions emerge from within . "
dr kamal and his team of workers from the aid charity care are taking their scheme to jarganath pur , a village in northern bangladesh .
" open defecation is rampant in this village and we are going to trigger clts , " he explains .
he begins by asking the villagers to gather together for a general meeting , and the team plots a map of where everyone goes to the toilet around the village and surrounding area .
the team then show how easily people and livestock spread faeces around the village and into homes .
dr kamal drives home the point by asking his shocked audience if he can take a photo of any villager who is happy to eat their neighbours ' faeces .
he says the aim of this is to shame the community into action .
it is not too long before the first villager volunteers to build the first toilet .
" the most important thing in clts is that outsiders are definitely not asking the community to stop open defecation or change their hygiene behaviour practice , " says dr kamal .
" it is just empowering people to analyse their own sanitation ; everyone is a human being and no-one wants to live in a filthy and dirty condition . "
when the team returned to the village three days later , they were told that 15 toilets were either completed or were being built .
" we did n't realise before that open defecation can cause a lot of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera , " reveals one villager .
" that 's why we are doing this now . "
as well as stopping the spread of diseases , building toilets also means that villagers can now grow food on land once used as a lavatory .
the extra crops mean that no-one suffers during " monga " , a period of seasonal hunger between the sowing and harvesting of crops .
dr kamal hopes the international community will look at the success of clts .
" many development agencies money and resources ; they spend huge amounts of money , " he explains .
" but in clts , you empower the community , triggering all these things and you also create a conducive environment for the community to move on .
" as a matter of fact , this is a whole shift in the paradigm of development interventions . "

it has the highest population density of any nation on the planet ; and a half of its people are without adequate sanitation .
as a result , the rivers and fields are polluted with human waste that enters the food chain .
according to figures from water aid , 125,000 children under the age of five die each year from diarrhoeal diseases .
" in one year , 140 people died in this village from diarrhoea ; we saw it with our own eyes , " a bangladeshi man tells the television trust for the environment 's -lrb- tve -rrb- earth report programme .
" they all died within 15 to 20 days , and people who used to dig their graves had their lunch beside the graves because they did not have time to go home . "
help yourselves the floodplains of bangladesh are considered to be among the most fertile soils in the world .
living in close proximity helped spread diseases however , the reason behind the richness of the land is also a major threat for the rice farmers who grow their crops here .
for up to six months each year , the fields are covered by water , which increases the risk of diseases like cholera .
to stop the spread of diseases , an awareness raising scheme called community led total sanitation -lrb- clts -rrb- is helping local people to help themselves .
" in the clts approach , the solutions are not imposed from the outside and the community is not told what to do , " explains clts founder kamal kar .
" the community is empowered and the solutions emerge from within . "
dr kamal and his team of workers from the aid charity care are taking their scheme to jarganath pur , a village in northern bangladesh .
a large map illustrates the extent of the sanitation problem " open defecation is rampant in this village and we are going to trigger clts , " he explains .
he begins by asking the villagers to gather together for a general meeting , and the team plots a map of where everyone goes to the toilet around the village and surrounding area .
the team then show how easily people and livestock spread faeces around the village and into homes .
dr kamal drives home the point by asking his shocked audience if he can take a photo of any villager who is happy to eat their neighbours ' faeces .
he says the aim of this is to shame the community into action .
it is not too long before the first villager volunteers to build the first toilet .
" the most important thing in clts is that outsiders are definitely not asking the community to stop open defecation or change their hygiene behaviour practice , " says dr kamal .
" it is just empowering people to analyse their own sanitation ; everyone is a human being and no-one wants to live in a filthy and dirty condition . "
the introduction of toilets allows more land to be farmed for food when the team returned to the village three days later , they were told that 15 toilets were either completed or were being built .
" we did n't realise before that open defecation can cause a lot of diseases like diarrhoea and cholera , " reveals one villager .
" that 's why we are doing this now . "
as well as stopping the spread of diseases , building toilets also means that villagers can now grow food on land once used as a lavatory .
the extra crops mean that no-one suffers during " monga " , a period of seasonal hunger between the sowing and harvesting of crops .
dr kamal hopes the international community will look at the success of clts .
" many development agencies money and resources ; they spend huge amounts of money , " he explains .
" but in clts , you empower the community , triggering all these things and you also create a conducive environment for the community to move on .

the road at llandrindod wells lake is to close nightly for the next three weeks to aid the breeding season .
the population of frogs , toads and newts is one of the most significant in wales but since 1970 it has fallen by nearly two thirds .
up to 2,000 creatures , including great crested newts , cross the road on their way to breed in the lake .
this year 's temporary overnight closure - from 2000 gmt to 0600 gmt - is a week longer than previously , lasting until saturday 5 april .
powys council said hundreds of toads cross the road every spring on their way from nearby woods to the lake to spawn with many falling victim to passing vehicles .
gareth morgan , board member with portfolio responsibility for countryside services , said the local authority had a statutory duty to help conserve biodiversity .
he said : " this is a perfect example of how we can make a real difference to our local wildlife with a relatively small amount of effort . "
' faithful ' conservationists are set to help the lakeside love-in by using buckets to carry as many of the amphibians as they can across the road .
biodiversity officer emma durward said : " toads are faithful to the same breeding site , returning year after year .
" unfortunately , this means that lethal obstacles situated along their annual migration routes , such as busy roads , could pose a significant threat to the long-term survival of the population .
" we appreciate that some drivers have to change their routine for a few days and we 're very grateful for their co-operation . "

the road at llandrindod wells lake is to close nightly for the next three weeks to aid the breeding season .
the population of frogs , toads and newts is one of the most significant in wales but since 1970 it has fallen by nearly two thirds .
up to 2,000 creatures , including great crested newts , cross the road on their way to breed in the lake .
this year 's temporary overnight closure - from 2000 gmt to 0600 gmt - is a week longer than previously , lasting until saturday 5 april .
powys council said hundreds of toads cross the road every spring on their way from nearby woods to the lake to spawn with many falling victim to passing vehicles .
gareth morgan , board member with portfolio responsibility for countryside services , said the local authority had a statutory duty to help conserve biodiversity .
he said : " this is a perfect example of how we can make a real difference to our local wildlife with a relatively small amount of effort . "
' faithful ' conservationists are set to help the lakeside love-in by using buckets to carry as many of the amphibians as they can across the road .
biodiversity officer emma durward said : " toads are faithful to the same breeding site , returning year after year .
" unfortunately , this means that lethal obstacles situated along their annual migration routes , such as busy roads , could pose a significant threat to the long-term survival of the population .
" we appreciate that some drivers have to change their routine for a few days and we 're very grateful for their co-operation . "

one of the very few is nauru , a pacific island nation halfway between australia and hawaii .
the island of nauru is the world 's smallest independent republic dubbed pleasant island in the 18th century by the captain of a passing british ship - it is the world 's smallest independent republic , a coral speck dwarfed by the vastness of the pacific ocean .
on most assignments , one of the first tasks is to hire a car .
on nauru , it did n't really seem worth the bother , i opted instead for a battered mountain bike .
it took me about an hour and a half to cycle the narrow coast road , sweating profusely beneath the fierce equatorial sun .
before i knew it , i was back where i started .
i had just circumnavigated the entire country .
nauru may be little , but it once enjoyed enormous wealth .
in fact nauruans were among the richest people , per capita , in the world .
hardly anyone thought of investing the money .
dollar notes were even used as toilet paper a quirk of nature means that their island consists of some of the world 's purest phosphate - the legacy of millions of years of sea bird droppings reacting with an uplifted coral .
spending spree from independence from britain and australia in 1968 , until the 1990s , nauru earned a fortune exporting its phosphate for fertiliser .
islanders are returning to fishing now the money has run out the decades of mining left the once-lush interior a bleak moonscape of strange , grey coral spikes - all that is left once the phosphate-rich top soil is scooped out of the ground - but nauruans did not care .
they gave up their jobs , brought in migrants from other pacific islands to do the hot , dirty work of digging and sat back waiting for the royalty cheques to drop into their hands .
they then went on an extraordinary spending spree .
families who had never left the island would charter aircraft to take them on shopping expeditions in hawaii , fiji and singapore .
sports cars were imported , despite the fact that nauru has only one paved road and the speed limit is 25mph .
a police chief memorably bought a sleek yellow lamborghini , only to find he was too portly to fit in the driver 's seat .
" we just did n't know how to handle it all , " a barefoot islander told me as he played his guitar beneath a tree .
" hardly anyone thought of investing the money .
dollar notes were even used as toilet paper , " his friend told me .
" it 's true , " he insisted seeing my look of disbelief .
" it was like every day was party day . "
the nauraun children are still hopeful for the island 's future a procession of conmen and carpetbaggers persuaded successive governments to invest in a string of bizarre schemes , including a west end musical about the life of leonardo da vinci .
nauru amassed a property portfolio of hotels and office blocks around the world .
but corruption and downright incompetence took their toll and by the early part of this century , most of the assets had to be sold off to pay for the country 's mounting debts .
now all the money is gone .
angry islanders signs of nauru 's former wealth are few and far between .
homes are dilapidated , with holes punched through their walls .
an area known as location is one of the most squalid slums i have come across in the south pacific , a concrete ghetto of smashed windows , stray dogs and graffiti .
we 're doing our best to climb out of it .
it wo n't be like in our heyday , but at least we 'll be comfortable marcus stephen , nauru president the brand new cars which islanders bought are rusted wrecks smothered in tropical undergrowth .
last week a mob of angry islanders burnt down nauru 's only prison in what the government said was politically motivated unrest orchestrated by a former president .
now comes another blow to this micronesian micro-nation .
a refugee detention centre , set up by australia seven years ago , will close down at the end of this month .
it was built by the government of prime minister john howard at a time when hundreds of boat people were trying to reach australia .
it proved a huge vote-winner , but mr howard was turfed out in november and his successor , labour prime minister kevin rudd , swiftly moved to shut it down .
nauruans are distraught - the facility brought much-needed jobs and hundreds of big-spending contractors , police and officials .
phosphate mining has resumed in on the island of nauru despite all these trials , nauru is determined to get back on its feet .
a new reformist government is hatching plans to establish the island as a pit-stop for international tuna boats to refuel and repair .
a mining company hopes to extract precious metals from the surrounding sea-bed .
phosphate mining has resumed with the government claiming there is another 30 years of reserves up in the scarred interior .
hangover " we find ourselves in a big hole , " concedes newly-elected president and former weight-lifting champion , marcus stephen .
" we 're doing our best to climb out of it .
it wo n't be like in our heyday , but at least we 'll be comfortable . "
nauruans realise that the party is well and truly over .
now comes the hangover and then , with luck , some sort of recovery .
but it will take squeaky clean governance , hard work and rock-solid investments for pleasant island to once again live up to its name .
it may not yet be paradise lost , but it is most definitely paradise postponed .

one of the very few is nauru , a pacific island nation halfway between australia and hawaii .
the island of nauru is the world 's smallest independent republic dubbed pleasant island in the 18th century by the captain of a passing british ship - it is the world 's smallest independent republic , a coral speck dwarfed by the vastness of the pacific ocean .
on most assignments , one of the first tasks is to hire a car .
on nauru , it did n't really seem worth the bother , i opted instead for a battered mountain bike .
it took me about an hour and a half to cycle the narrow coast road , sweating profusely beneath the fierce equatorial sun .
before i knew it , i was back where i started .
i had just circumnavigated the entire country .
nauru may be little , but it once enjoyed enormous wealth .
in fact nauruans were among the richest people , per capita , in the world .
hardly anyone thought of investing the money .
dollar notes were even used as toilet paper a quirk of nature means that their island consists of some of the world 's purest phosphate - the legacy of millions of years of sea bird droppings reacting with an uplifted coral .
spending spree from independence from britain and australia in 1968 , until the 1990s , nauru earned a fortune exporting its phosphate for fertiliser .
islanders are returning to fishing now the money has run out the decades of mining left the once-lush interior a bleak moonscape of strange , grey coral spikes - all that is left once the phosphate-rich top soil is scooped out of the ground - but nauruans did not care .
they gave up their jobs , brought in migrants from other pacific islands to do the hot , dirty work of digging and sat back waiting for the royalty cheques to drop into their hands .
they then went on an extraordinary spending spree .
families who had never left the island would charter aircraft to take them on shopping expeditions in hawaii , fiji and singapore .
sports cars were imported , despite the fact that nauru has only one paved road and the speed limit is 25mph .
a police chief memorably bought a sleek yellow lamborghini , only to find he was too portly to fit in the driver 's seat .
" we just did n't know how to handle it all , " a barefoot islander told me as he played his guitar beneath a tree .
" hardly anyone thought of investing the money .
dollar notes were even used as toilet paper , " his friend told me .
" it 's true , " he insisted seeing my look of disbelief .
" it was like every day was party day . "
the nauraun children are still hopeful for the island 's future a procession of conmen and carpetbaggers persuaded successive governments to invest in a string of bizarre schemes , including a west end musical about the life of leonardo da vinci .
nauru amassed a property portfolio of hotels and office blocks around the world .
but corruption and downright incompetence took their toll and by the early part of this century , most of the assets had to be sold off to pay for the country 's mounting debts .
now all the money is gone .

speaking publicly for the first time about its decision not to refer ms alexander to prosecutors , the commission dismissed criticism .
it followed an investigation into an illegal £ 950 donation made to her campaign from a developer in jersey .
critics branded the process a whitewash but the commission said it was robust .
head of the electoral commission in scotland andy o 'neill said the 10-week process had been necessary .
you simply ca n't say it will take a week or two weeks andy o 'neill electoral commission in scotland he said : " i actually personally do n't think that was a particularly long time .
" you have to bear in mind there are other investigations which are still ongoing which have n't reported , yet started before this one .
" you simply ca n't say it will take a week or two weeks - you have to be robust and thorough , which is what we 've tried to be . "
ms alexander 's leadership campaign team solicited a payment of £ 950 from jersey-based businessman paul green .
ballot review the donation was illegal because it came from someone not on the electoral register .
the commission ruled ms alexander did not take all reasonable steps to comply with the law , but found she had taken " significant " steps .
the scottish labour leader said the decision had proven her " honesty and integrity " .
in a wide-ranging interview on bbc radio scotland , mr o 'neill also said the commission was in the process of setting standards for the design of election ballot papers in a bid to prevent a repeat of last year 's scottish election fiasco .
snp msp roseanna cunningham said : " clearly the electoral commission want to justify their investigation into wendy alexander .
" the problem the commission now faces is that there is little faith left in its enforcement of the laws . "
ms cunningham said there were still questions the commission needed to answer .
she said : " when is an illegal donation actually illegal ?
what will happen to anyone accepting , knowingly or otherwise , an illegal donation in the future ?
" the commission may feel it acted properly in the investigation but the wendy alexander decision has created a black hole in our electoral laws . "

homecoming scotland in 2009 - backed by public agencies and the scottish government - is being targeted at expats in the usa and canada .
by coincidence next year is the 250th anniversary of the fall of quebec .
scottish regiments were heavily involved in the battle which played a role in the birth of canada .
the homecoming celebrations , an initiative led by the scottish government and supported by eventscotland and visitscotland , will aim to highlight scotland 's history , achievements and industries .
next year also marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of bard robert burns and it was this event with which homecoming was set up to co-incide .

historians credit the fall of quebec as the beginning of the end of new france - french-held territories in modern day canada - and the emergence of quebecois , people who considered themselves neither french nor british .

" ten years after culloden , highlanders were recruited into the british army for service in north america - until then highlanders were seen by the south of scotland and england as rebels . "
prof hunter added : " it was successes at places like quebec , the highland fighter in his kilt became the absolute archetype of the british military and british empire . "
the director of the uhi centre for history said he visited the battlefield for a bbc programme several years ago .
