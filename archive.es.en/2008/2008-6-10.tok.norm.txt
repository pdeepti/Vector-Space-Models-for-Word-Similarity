sony bmg owns top record labels such as columbia and epic and has a list of blockbuster artists such as alicia keys , leona lewis and avril lavigne .
record sales continue to drop bertelsmann boss hartmut ostrowski wants to get out of the music business as internet downloads have caused sales to fall .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "

france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "

sony has an option to buy should bertelsmann decided to sell its stake , the faz newspaper said , without identifying its source .
sony bmg owns top record labels such as columbia and epic and has a list of blockbuster artists such as alicia keys , leona lewis and avril lavigne .
record sales continue to drop bertelsmann boss hartmut ostrowski wants to get out of the music business as internet downloads have caused sales to fall .
the partners have not agreed on a price , but the deal could be finalized within a few months , according to the faz report .
even if bertelsmann eventually gives up its share in sony bmg , it will still have record and book clubs .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2008 bring on the trash , hamburg tells naples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is willing to take all this and more the italian city of naples , rocked by a series of garbage crises in recent months , can count on some german help in taking care of the stinky situation . from naples , the italian city with nowhere to dump its rubbish , the freight trains take 44 hours to reach hamburg , a german city that is only too happy to incinerate the stinking mess .
hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even the laconic german playmaker turned sports broadcaster could not help expressing his " huge admiration " for 24-year-old dutchmen wesley sneijder .
the young midfielder was all over the pitch in holland 's 3-0 thrashing of italy on monday , june 9 , winning balls , feeding ruud van nistelrooy for his side 's first goal and scoring the second with a superb volley past arguably the best keeper in the world .
sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?

but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makelele could soon be getting a golden handshake and france , whose goalless draw against romania provided the lowlight of the tournament thus far , is even more ancient .

" we have made an important breakthrough on this subject where initially our positions were very , very far apart , " merkel said at a franco-german summit in the southern german town of straubing .
" i am very happy to be able to say that we both support the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometre on all new eu cars by 2012 . "
merkel said the countries would agree to a european commission goal of cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for new cars , but would allow a longer phasing-in period for older cars .
germany has been concerned that planned european union rules will put its luxury automobile industry at a disadvantage .
french president nicolas sarkozy joined merkel at the press conference .
the announcement was a surprise as the two countries were seen as still being too far apart for a compromise to be found .
different cars , different concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they found an acceptable compromise germany and france build very different types of cars .
german companies like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to sell larger , luxury vehicles with higher emissions . french carmakers like peugeot and renault sell a larger percentage of smaller cars which pollute less .
the deal supports an eu goal to limit emissions to 120 grams per kilometer starting in 2012 .
berlin and paris have been looking for a compromise on burden-sharing of co2 reductions for months .
" the details will still have to be worked out by our environmental ministers but we believe that this is a giant step ahead , " merkel said .
" we have proven again that france and germany can work together .
we have agreed to work together . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .

the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .

green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”

nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.06.2008 europe hold its breath ahead of irish vote on eu treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland 's no camp is warning voters the eu treaty will leave a bitter aftertaste as ireland counts down for the european union 's only referendum on the lisbon treaty , eu and irish leaders are keeping their fingers crossed as they hope to avoid disaster . an opinion poll published in the irish times friday showed the no camp five points ahead of the yes , for the first time since the campaign began .
that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important .

three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .

treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions .

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”

“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .

the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one really can not say that george w. bush made the world better , " klose said .
world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .
bush wants backup in afghanistan the us has also kept up pressure on european allies to do more in afghanistan and bush seemed likely to continue to press the issue .
the us wants european nations to supply more combat troops for the nato-led security force .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .

sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?
germany , portugal on the rise bildunterschrift : podolski - a sub at bayern , a star for germany germany 's two biggest stars are miroslav klose and michael ballack .
but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makelele could soon be getting a golden handshake and france , whose goalless draw against romania provided the lowlight of the tournament thus far , is even more ancient .
willy sagnol , lilian thuram , william gallas , claude makelele - all fabulous players in the past - looked riper for retirement than for one last international title .
their combined ages are a century-and-a-third - hardly a statistic that would lead many to believe that les bleus go far in the world 's toughest soccer tournament . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have made an important breakthrough on this subject where initially our positions were very , very far apart , " merkel said at a franco-german summit in the southern german town of straubing .
" i am very happy to be able to say that we both support the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometre on all new eu cars by 2012 . "
merkel said the countries would agree to a european commission goal of cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for new cars , but would allow a longer phasing-in period for older cars .
germany has been concerned that planned european union rules will put its luxury automobile industry at a disadvantage .
french president nicolas sarkozy joined merkel at the press conference .
the announcement was a surprise as the two countries were seen as still being too far apart for a compromise to be found .
different cars , different concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they found an acceptable compromise germany and france build very different types of cars .
german companies like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to sell larger , luxury vehicles with higher emissions . french carmakers like peugeot and renault sell a larger percentage of smaller cars which pollute less .
the deal supports an eu goal to limit emissions to 120 grams per kilometer starting in 2012 .
berlin and paris have been looking for a compromise on burden-sharing of co2 reductions for months .
" the details will still have to be worked out by our environmental ministers but we believe that this is a giant step ahead , " merkel said .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .
there was better news for greece coach otto rehhagel with the news that the german will have a full squad to pick from for the defending champions ' group d clash tuesday with sweden in salzburg .
uefa have confirmed that there will be no extra security for wednesday 's tie between switzerland and turkey .

i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .

zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .

" i trust there will be a serious discussion about the prospects of peace in the middle east , and on whether it will be possible as promised to have a palestinian state by the end of the year , " mussa told a news conference in ljubljana monday .
slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , hosted mussa on a two-day visit just ahead of the eu-us summit to be held tuesday .
" we hope ... there will be a viable real state by the end of the year , " he said .
" this is a question that should be addressed to him -lrb- president bush -rrb- , an appeal that should be expressed . " initial reports , however , suggest that the question of a middle east peace agreement is not on the table at this conference . taking steps toward peace still , the arab league is searching for a resolution . " i think one of the important steps to face -lrb- in this situation -rrb- is for fatah and hamas to close ranks , and this is our -lrb- the arab league 's -rrb- task to achieve , " mussa said . at the same time , mussa accused israel of standing in the way of an accord .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2008 bring on the trash , hamburg tells naples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is willing to take all this and more the italian city of naples , rocked by a series of garbage crises in recent months , can count on some german help in taking care of the stinky situation . from naples , the italian city with nowhere to dump its rubbish , the freight trains take 44 hours to reach hamburg , a german city that is only too happy to incinerate the stinking mess .
hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .

the industry 's hoping that the three-week championships will give a one-to-two percent kick to beer sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public viewing areas ramp up crowds and beer sales " the breweries are completely euphoric , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , spokesman for the german brewery association .
much like the national team 's fans , the nation 's breweries are hoping for a repeat of the 2006 world cup - dubbed the summer fairy tale throughout the country as the home team placed third amid a national frenzy . breweries hoping to reverse a downward trend but apart from mirroring the beer sales clocked up in germany two years ago , the nation 's brewery industry hopes that an increase in beer consumption during the european championships will also help to lift the country 's annual beer sales out of the doldrums . the home of oktoberfest is losing its taste for beer as germans have been switching in recent years to the finer art of wine drinking .
industry figures showed that wine consumption last year hit an all-time high averaging 20.6 liters per head of the population . german beer consumption , meanwhile , has slumped from an average of 142.7 litres a head each year in 1990 to a record low of 111.7 liters last year .

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .

some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .

nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions . " island voting meanwhile , voting got underway monday on five islands off the north-western coast , three days before the rest of the country . in total 745 people are entitled to vote on the islands off the coast of county donegal .
arranmore , gola , inishbofin , inishfree and tory traditionally vote early in case bad weather cuts them off , delaying the collection of ballot boxes . the islanders ' votes will be taken by helicopter to the mainland and counted with the remainder of the donegal constituency 's votes on friday . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions . " island voting meanwhile , voting got underway monday on five islands off the north-western coast , three days before the rest of the country . in total 745 people are entitled to vote on the islands off the coast of county donegal .
arranmore , gola , inishbofin , inishfree and tory traditionally vote early in case bad weather cuts them off , delaying the collection of ballot boxes . the islanders ' votes will be taken by helicopter to the mainland and counted with the remainder of the donegal constituency 's votes on friday . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "

no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions . " island voting meanwhile , voting got underway monday on five islands off the north-western coast , three days before the rest of the country . in total 745 people are entitled to vote on the islands off the coast of county donegal .
arranmore , gola , inishbofin , inishfree and tory traditionally vote early in case bad weather cuts them off , delaying the collection of ballot boxes . the islanders ' votes will be taken by helicopter to the mainland and counted with the remainder of the donegal constituency 's votes on friday . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 10.06.2008 germany to help russia destroy chemical weapon stockpile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has the world 's largest chemical weapons arsenal the russian town of pochep is home to a massive stockpile of chemical weapons , some decades old .
too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

the industry 's hoping that the three-week championships will give a one-to-two percent kick to beer sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public viewing areas ramp up crowds and beer sales " the breweries are completely euphoric , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , spokesman for the german brewery association .
much like the national team 's fans , the nation 's breweries are hoping for a repeat of the 2006 world cup - dubbed the summer fairy tale throughout the country as the home team placed third amid a national frenzy . breweries hoping to reverse a downward trend but apart from mirroring the beer sales clocked up in germany two years ago , the nation 's brewery industry hopes that an increase in beer consumption during the european championships will also help to lift the country 's annual beer sales out of the doldrums . the home of oktoberfest is losing its taste for beer as germans have been switching in recent years to the finer art of wine drinking .
industry figures showed that wine consumption last year hit an all-time high averaging 20.6 liters per head of the population . german beer consumption , meanwhile , has slumped from an average of 142.7 litres a head each year in 1990 to a record low of 111.7 liters last year .
eight years ago consumption stood at 125.6 liters . the fall in beer consumption in germany has already sparked a major shakeout in the nation 's beer business with smaller breweries closing their doors or being taken over by larger rivals . but already in may , retailers began stocking up their supplies ahead of the start of the soccer championships and the european summer sporting season .
breweries are hoping that the trend to higher beer consumption during the european championships will continue through to the beijing olympics in august . this combination of sporting events has brewers hopeful that beer consumption per head this year could edge back up to the 2006 level of about 116 liters . public fan gatherings a boon to brewers a boon to the breweries has the emergence of public viewing areas at the world cup . in a sense , access to the electricity supply for a television screen and somewhere to keep the crates of beer cold are the only key components for creating public viewing areas . this means that in addition to major vantage points such as berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , bars , restaurants , street corners and even vacant blocks of land have been transformed into areas for fans to gather and watch the games . bildunterschrift : all that 's needed is for the national eleven to advance still , other factors will determine if it is a successful european championship for the german brewers .
for one , there is the weather , which according to forecasts is to turn cooler and wetter from wednesday onwards . perhaps more importantly , though , german captain michael ballack 's team needs to keep the germans ' hopes alive of their first european championship title since 1996 by progressing towards the final in vienna on june 29 .

but even the laconic german playmaker turned sports broadcaster could not help expressing his " huge admiration " for 24-year-old dutchmen wesley sneijder .
the young midfielder was all over the pitch in holland 's 3-0 thrashing of italy on monday , june 9 , winning balls , feeding ruud van nistelrooy for his side 's first goal and scoring the second with a superb volley past arguably the best keeper in the world .
sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?

but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .

military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .

bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .

it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .

russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions . " island voting meanwhile , voting got underway monday on five islands off the north-western coast , three days before the rest of the country . in total 745 people are entitled to vote on the islands off the coast of county donegal .
arranmore , gola , inishbofin , inishfree and tory traditionally vote early in case bad weather cuts them off , delaying the collection of ballot boxes . the islanders ' votes will be taken by helicopter to the mainland and counted with the remainder of the donegal constituency 's votes on friday . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have made an important breakthrough on this subject where initially our positions were very , very far apart , " merkel said at a franco-german summit in the southern german town of straubing .
" i am very happy to be able to say that we both support the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometre on all new eu cars by 2012 . "
merkel said the countries would agree to a european commission goal of cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for new cars , but would allow a longer phasing-in period for older cars .
germany has been concerned that planned european union rules will put its luxury automobile industry at a disadvantage .
french president nicolas sarkozy joined merkel at the press conference .
the announcement was a surprise as the two countries were seen as still being too far apart for a compromise to be found .
different cars , different concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they found an acceptable compromise germany and france build very different types of cars .
german companies like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to sell larger , luxury vehicles with higher emissions . french carmakers like peugeot and renault sell a larger percentage of smaller cars which pollute less .
the deal supports an eu goal to limit emissions to 120 grams per kilometer starting in 2012 .
berlin and paris have been looking for a compromise on burden-sharing of co2 reductions for months .
" the details will still have to be worked out by our environmental ministers but we believe that this is a giant step ahead , " merkel said .

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

" one really can not say that george w. bush made the world better , " klose said .
world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .
bush wants backup in afghanistan the us has also kept up pressure on european allies to do more in afghanistan and bush seemed likely to continue to press the issue .
the us wants european nations to supply more combat troops for the nato-led security force .

bush , merkel to have informal chat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets a big texas welcome at the bush ranch german chancellor angela merkel has a better relationship than most world leaders with bush .
bush and merkel will meet together at the secluded schloss meseberg near berlin after the summt finishes tuesday .
bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .
trade , weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar just is n't what it used to be a main message bush will bring to europe is his concern about the weak us economy and the fall of the dollar , which has tumbled to record lows against the euro this year .
as he spoke to reporters monday , the euro reached a six-week high of $ 1.5845 .
" i 'll talk about our nation 's commitment to a strong dollar , " he said .
" a strong dollar is in our nation 's interests .
it is in the interests of the global economy . "
rising food and oil prices are also likely to be a theme as bush meets with european leaders .

merkel said the countries would agree to a european commission goal of cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for new cars , but would allow a longer phasing-in period for older cars .
germany has been concerned that planned european union rules will put its luxury automobile industry at a disadvantage .

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i trust there will be a serious discussion about the prospects of peace in the middle east , and on whether it will be possible as promised to have a palestinian state by the end of the year , " mussa told a news conference in ljubljana monday .
slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , hosted mussa on a two-day visit just ahead of the eu-us summit to be held tuesday .
" we hope ... there will be a viable real state by the end of the year , " he said .
" this is a question that should be addressed to him -lrb- president bush -rrb- , an appeal that should be expressed . " initial reports , however , suggest that the question of a middle east peace agreement is not on the table at this conference . taking steps toward peace still , the arab league is searching for a resolution . " i think one of the important steps to face -lrb- in this situation -rrb- is for fatah and hamas to close ranks , and this is our -lrb- the arab league 's -rrb- task to achieve , " mussa said . at the same time , mussa accused israel of standing in the way of an accord . " israel does n't seem ready to give anything or enter into a deal , " he said . saudi king abdullah and palestinian president mahmud abbas on sunday agreed that the arab league should oversee truce talks between the palestinian groups fatah and hamas . last week , abbas had called for dialogue with hamas , breaking with his previous policy of rejecting any opening until they cede control of the territory . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .

fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have made an important breakthrough on this subject where initially our positions were very , very far apart , " merkel said at a franco-german summit in the southern german town of straubing .
" i am very happy to be able to say that we both support the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometre on all new eu cars by 2012 . "
merkel said the countries would agree to a european commission goal of cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for new cars , but would allow a longer phasing-in period for older cars .
germany has been concerned that planned european union rules will put its luxury automobile industry at a disadvantage .
french president nicolas sarkozy joined merkel at the press conference .
the announcement was a surprise as the two countries were seen as still being too far apart for a compromise to be found .
different cars , different concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they found an acceptable compromise germany and france build very different types of cars .
german companies like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to sell larger , luxury vehicles with higher emissions . french carmakers like peugeot and renault sell a larger percentage of smaller cars which pollute less .
the deal supports an eu goal to limit emissions to 120 grams per kilometer starting in 2012 .
berlin and paris have been looking for a compromise on burden-sharing of co2 reductions for months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2008 bring on the trash , hamburg tells naples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is willing to take all this and more the italian city of naples , rocked by a series of garbage crises in recent months , can count on some german help in taking care of the stinky situation . from naples , the italian city with nowhere to dump its rubbish , the freight trains take 44 hours to reach hamburg , a german city that is only too happy to incinerate the stinking mess .
hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one really can not say that george w. bush made the world better , " klose said .
world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .

bush and merkel will meet together at the secluded schloss meseberg near berlin after the summt finishes tuesday .
bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .

it is in the interests of the global economy . "
rising food and oil prices are also likely to be a theme as bush meets with european leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 10.06.2008 opinion : knock-out round is a disservice to teams , fans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former french star deschamps and ex-germany coach klinsmann at the euro draw for hardcore soccer fans , there 's no better tournament than the european championship .
too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .

" one really can not say that george w. bush made the world better , " klose said .
world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .

bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .
trade , weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar just is n't what it used to be a main message bush will bring to europe is his concern about the weak us economy and the fall of the dollar , which has tumbled to record lows against the euro this year .
as he spoke to reporters monday , the euro reached a six-week high of $ 1.5845 .
" i 'll talk about our nation 's commitment to a strong dollar , " he said .
" a strong dollar is in our nation 's interests .
it is in the interests of the global economy . "
rising food and oil prices are also likely to be a theme as bush meets with european leaders .
" the current oil and food price rises show how important the eu-us cooperation is at a global level , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso in a statement monday .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .
there was better news for greece coach otto rehhagel with the news that the german will have a full squad to pick from for the defending champions ' group d clash tuesday with sweden in salzburg .
uefa have confirmed that there will be no extra security for wednesday 's tie between switzerland and turkey .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .

but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2008 bring on the trash , hamburg tells naples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is willing to take all this and more the italian city of naples , rocked by a series of garbage crises in recent months , can count on some german help in taking care of the stinky situation . from naples , the italian city with nowhere to dump its rubbish , the freight trains take 44 hours to reach hamburg , a german city that is only too happy to incinerate the stinking mess .
hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have made an important breakthrough on this subject where initially our positions were very , very far apart , " merkel said at a franco-german summit in the southern german town of straubing .
" i am very happy to be able to say that we both support the eu goal of 120 grams per kilometre on all new eu cars by 2012 . "
merkel said the countries would agree to a european commission goal of cutting carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for new cars , but would allow a longer phasing-in period for older cars .
germany has been concerned that planned european union rules will put its luxury automobile industry at a disadvantage .
french president nicolas sarkozy joined merkel at the press conference .
the announcement was a surprise as the two countries were seen as still being too far apart for a compromise to be found .
different cars , different concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they found an acceptable compromise germany and france build very different types of cars .
german companies like bmw , daimler and porsche tend to sell larger , luxury vehicles with higher emissions . french carmakers like peugeot and renault sell a larger percentage of smaller cars which pollute less .
the deal supports an eu goal to limit emissions to 120 grams per kilometer starting in 2012 .
berlin and paris have been looking for a compromise on burden-sharing of co2 reductions for months .
" the details will still have to be worked out by our environmental ministers but we believe that this is a giant step ahead , " merkel said .

" one really can not say that george w. bush made the world better , " klose said .
world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .
bush wants backup in afghanistan the us has also kept up pressure on european allies to do more in afghanistan and bush seemed likely to continue to press the issue .
the us wants european nations to supply more combat troops for the nato-led security force .
" got a lot of work to do in afghanistan , " bush said monday at the white house before leaving for europe .
" the countries i 'm going to have committed troops to afghanistan , and , of course , i want to thank them , and remind them there 's a lot of work to be done . "

bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .
trade , weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar just is n't what it used to be a main message bush will bring to europe is his concern about the weak us economy and the fall of the dollar , which has tumbled to record lows against the euro this year .
as he spoke to reporters monday , the euro reached a six-week high of $ 1.5845 .
" i 'll talk about our nation 's commitment to a strong dollar , " he said .
" a strong dollar is in our nation 's interests .
it is in the interests of the global economy . "
rising food and oil prices are also likely to be a theme as bush meets with european leaders .

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .
there was better news for greece coach otto rehhagel with the news that the german will have a full squad to pick from for the defending champions ' group d clash tuesday with sweden in salzburg .
uefa have confirmed that there will be no extra security for wednesday 's tie between switzerland and turkey .

is this a trend in the making ? as an old-school footballer , günter netzer is n't usually quick with superlatives .
but even the laconic german playmaker turned sports broadcaster could not help expressing his " huge admiration " for 24-year-old dutchmen wesley sneijder .
the young midfielder was all over the pitch in holland 's 3-0 thrashing of italy on monday , june 9 , winning balls , feeding ruud van nistelrooy for his side 's first goal and scoring the second with a superb volley past arguably the best keeper in the world .
sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?
germany , portugal on the rise bildunterschrift : podolski - a sub at bayern , a star for germany germany 's two biggest stars are miroslav klose and michael ballack .
but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makelele could soon be getting a golden handshake and france , whose goalless draw against romania provided the lowlight of the tournament thus far , is even more ancient .
willy sagnol , lilian thuram , william gallas , claude makelele - all fabulous players in the past - looked riper for retirement than for one last international title .
their combined ages are a century-and-a-third - hardly a statistic that would lead many to believe that les bleus go far in the world 's toughest soccer tournament . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the industry 's hoping that the three-week championships will give a one-to-two percent kick to beer sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public viewing areas ramp up crowds and beer sales " the breweries are completely euphoric , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , spokesman for the german brewery association .
much like the national team 's fans , the nation 's breweries are hoping for a repeat of the 2006 world cup - dubbed the summer fairy tale throughout the country as the home team placed third amid a national frenzy . breweries hoping to reverse a downward trend but apart from mirroring the beer sales clocked up in germany two years ago , the nation 's brewery industry hopes that an increase in beer consumption during the european championships will also help to lift the country 's annual beer sales out of the doldrums . the home of oktoberfest is losing its taste for beer as germans have been switching in recent years to the finer art of wine drinking .
industry figures showed that wine consumption last year hit an all-time high averaging 20.6 liters per head of the population . german beer consumption , meanwhile , has slumped from an average of 142.7 litres a head each year in 1990 to a record low of 111.7 liters last year .
eight years ago consumption stood at 125.6 liters . the fall in beer consumption in germany has already sparked a major shakeout in the nation 's beer business with smaller breweries closing their doors or being taken over by larger rivals . but already in may , retailers began stocking up their supplies ahead of the start of the soccer championships and the european summer sporting season .
breweries are hoping that the trend to higher beer consumption during the european championships will continue through to the beijing olympics in august . this combination of sporting events has brewers hopeful that beer consumption per head this year could edge back up to the 2006 level of about 116 liters . public fan gatherings a boon to brewers a boon to the breweries has the emergence of public viewing areas at the world cup . in a sense , access to the electricity supply for a television screen and somewhere to keep the crates of beer cold are the only key components for creating public viewing areas . this means that in addition to major vantage points such as berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , bars , restaurants , street corners and even vacant blocks of land have been transformed into areas for fans to gather and watch the games . bildunterschrift : all that 's needed is for the national eleven to advance still , other factors will determine if it is a successful european championship for the german brewers .
for one , there is the weather , which according to forecasts is to turn cooler and wetter from wednesday onwards . perhaps more importantly , though , german captain michael ballack 's team needs to keep the germans ' hopes alive of their first european championship title since 1996 by progressing towards the final in vienna on june 29 . " the national eleven also has to contribute , " said huhnholz . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "

sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .

but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions . " island voting meanwhile , voting got underway monday on five islands off the north-western coast , three days before the rest of the country . in total 745 people are entitled to vote on the islands off the coast of county donegal .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions . " island voting meanwhile , voting got underway monday on five islands off the north-western coast , three days before the rest of the country . in total 745 people are entitled to vote on the islands off the coast of county donegal .

" one really can not say that george w. bush made the world better , " klose said .
world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .
bush wants backup in afghanistan the us has also kept up pressure on european allies to do more in afghanistan and bush seemed likely to continue to press the issue .
the us wants european nations to supply more combat troops for the nato-led security force .
" got a lot of work to do in afghanistan , " bush said monday at the white house before leaving for europe .
" the countries i 'm going to have committed troops to afghanistan , and , of course , i want to thank them , and remind them there 's a lot of work to be done . "
bush , merkel to have informal chat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets a big texas welcome at the bush ranch german chancellor angela merkel has a better relationship than most world leaders with bush .
bush and merkel will meet together at the secluded schloss meseberg near berlin after the summt finishes tuesday .
bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .
trade , weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar just is n't what it used to be a main message bush will bring to europe is his concern about the weak us economy and the fall of the dollar , which has tumbled to record lows against the euro this year .
as he spoke to reporters monday , the euro reached a six-week high of $ 1.5845 .
" i 'll talk about our nation 's commitment to a strong dollar , " he said .
" a strong dollar is in our nation 's interests .
it is in the interests of the global economy . "
rising food and oil prices are also likely to be a theme as bush meets with european leaders .
" the current oil and food price rises show how important the eu-us cooperation is at a global level , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso in a statement monday .
after visiting berlin , bush will move on to italy , the vatican , france and britain . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .

russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 10.06.2008 opinion : knock-out round is a disservice to teams , fans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former french star deschamps and ex-germany coach klinsmann at the euro draw for hardcore soccer fans , there 's no better tournament than the european championship .
too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

the industry 's hoping that the three-week championships will give a one-to-two percent kick to beer sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public viewing areas ramp up crowds and beer sales " the breweries are completely euphoric , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , spokesman for the german brewery association .
much like the national team 's fans , the nation 's breweries are hoping for a repeat of the 2006 world cup - dubbed the summer fairy tale throughout the country as the home team placed third amid a national frenzy . breweries hoping to reverse a downward trend but apart from mirroring the beer sales clocked up in germany two years ago , the nation 's brewery industry hopes that an increase in beer consumption during the european championships will also help to lift the country 's annual beer sales out of the doldrums . the home of oktoberfest is losing its taste for beer as germans have been switching in recent years to the finer art of wine drinking .
industry figures showed that wine consumption last year hit an all-time high averaging 20.6 liters per head of the population . german beer consumption , meanwhile , has slumped from an average of 142.7 litres a head each year in 1990 to a record low of 111.7 liters last year .
eight years ago consumption stood at 125.6 liters . the fall in beer consumption in germany has already sparked a major shakeout in the nation 's beer business with smaller breweries closing their doors or being taken over by larger rivals . but already in may , retailers began stocking up their supplies ahead of the start of the soccer championships and the european summer sporting season .
breweries are hoping that the trend to higher beer consumption during the european championships will continue through to the beijing olympics in august . this combination of sporting events has brewers hopeful that beer consumption per head this year could edge back up to the 2006 level of about 116 liters . public fan gatherings a boon to brewers a boon to the breweries has the emergence of public viewing areas at the world cup . in a sense , access to the electricity supply for a television screen and somewhere to keep the crates of beer cold are the only key components for creating public viewing areas . this means that in addition to major vantage points such as berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , bars , restaurants , street corners and even vacant blocks of land have been transformed into areas for fans to gather and watch the games . bildunterschrift : all that 's needed is for the national eleven to advance still , other factors will determine if it is a successful european championship for the german brewers .
for one , there is the weather , which according to forecasts is to turn cooler and wetter from wednesday onwards . perhaps more importantly , though , german captain michael ballack 's team needs to keep the germans ' hopes alive of their first european championship title since 1996 by progressing towards the final in vienna on june 29 . " the national eleven also has to contribute , " said huhnholz . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this a trend in the making ? as an old-school footballer , günter netzer is n't usually quick with superlatives .
but even the laconic german playmaker turned sports broadcaster could not help expressing his " huge admiration " for 24-year-old dutchmen wesley sneijder .
the young midfielder was all over the pitch in holland 's 3-0 thrashing of italy on monday , june 9 , winning balls , feeding ruud van nistelrooy for his side 's first goal and scoring the second with a superb volley past arguably the best keeper in the world .
sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?
germany , portugal on the rise bildunterschrift : podolski - a sub at bayern , a star for germany germany 's two biggest stars are miroslav klose and michael ballack .
but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makelele could soon be getting a golden handshake and france , whose goalless draw against romania provided the lowlight of the tournament thus far , is even more ancient .
willy sagnol , lilian thuram , william gallas , claude makelele - all fabulous players in the past - looked riper for retirement than for one last international title .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .
there was better news for greece coach otto rehhagel with the news that the german will have a full squad to pick from for the defending champions ' group d clash tuesday with sweden in salzburg .

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one really can not say that george w. bush made the world better , " klose said .
world " worse off " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : past bush visits have brought out protestors the view was echoed by the leader of germany 's opposition liberal democrats , guido westerwelle .
" the bush era was not good , neither for america nor for anyone who , like i , considers america a friend , " said westerwelle . bush " made the world noticeably worse , " said former environment minister and green party head juergen trittin , who faulted the us president for ignoring human rights and democracy .
" the credibility of democracy in the world has suffered dramatically because of bush 's double standards , " trittin said .
full agenda at eu summit bush 's first stop in europe will at be the annual european union-us summit being held at a secluded luxury resort outside the slovenian capital of ljubljana .
diplomats said the summit would focus on a joint declaration on issues such as global security , trans-atlantic trade , climate change and energy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top european leaders will meet with bush disagreements over the us 's refusal to include all eu member countries in its visa waiver program are also expected to surface .
" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .
bush wants backup in afghanistan the us has also kept up pressure on european allies to do more in afghanistan and bush seemed likely to continue to press the issue .
the us wants european nations to supply more combat troops for the nato-led security force .
" got a lot of work to do in afghanistan , " bush said monday at the white house before leaving for europe .
" the countries i 'm going to have committed troops to afghanistan , and , of course , i want to thank them , and remind them there 's a lot of work to be done . "
bush , merkel to have informal chat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets a big texas welcome at the bush ranch german chancellor angela merkel has a better relationship than most world leaders with bush .
bush and merkel will meet together at the secluded schloss meseberg near berlin after the summt finishes tuesday .
bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .
trade , weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar just is n't what it used to be a main message bush will bring to europe is his concern about the weak us economy and the fall of the dollar , which has tumbled to record lows against the euro this year .
as he spoke to reporters monday , the euro reached a six-week high of $ 1.5845 .
" i 'll talk about our nation 's commitment to a strong dollar , " he said .
" a strong dollar is in our nation 's interests .
it is in the interests of the global economy . "
rising food and oil prices are also likely to be a theme as bush meets with european leaders .
" the current oil and food price rises show how important the eu-us cooperation is at a global level , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso in a statement monday .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "

the industry 's hoping that the three-week championships will give a one-to-two percent kick to beer sales . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public viewing areas ramp up crowds and beer sales " the breweries are completely euphoric , " said marc-oliver huhnholz , spokesman for the german brewery association .
much like the national team 's fans , the nation 's breweries are hoping for a repeat of the 2006 world cup - dubbed the summer fairy tale throughout the country as the home team placed third amid a national frenzy . breweries hoping to reverse a downward trend but apart from mirroring the beer sales clocked up in germany two years ago , the nation 's brewery industry hopes that an increase in beer consumption during the european championships will also help to lift the country 's annual beer sales out of the doldrums . the home of oktoberfest is losing its taste for beer as germans have been switching in recent years to the finer art of wine drinking .
industry figures showed that wine consumption last year hit an all-time high averaging 20.6 liters per head of the population . german beer consumption , meanwhile , has slumped from an average of 142.7 litres a head each year in 1990 to a record low of 111.7 liters last year .
eight years ago consumption stood at 125.6 liters . the fall in beer consumption in germany has already sparked a major shakeout in the nation 's beer business with smaller breweries closing their doors or being taken over by larger rivals . but already in may , retailers began stocking up their supplies ahead of the start of the soccer championships and the european summer sporting season .
breweries are hoping that the trend to higher beer consumption during the european championships will continue through to the beijing olympics in august . this combination of sporting events has brewers hopeful that beer consumption per head this year could edge back up to the 2006 level of about 116 liters . public fan gatherings a boon to brewers a boon to the breweries has the emergence of public viewing areas at the world cup . in a sense , access to the electricity supply for a television screen and somewhere to keep the crates of beer cold are the only key components for creating public viewing areas . this means that in addition to major vantage points such as berlin 's historic brandenburg gate , bars , restaurants , street corners and even vacant blocks of land have been transformed into areas for fans to gather and watch the games . bildunterschrift : all that 's needed is for the national eleven to advance still , other factors will determine if it is a successful european championship for the german brewers .
for one , there is the weather , which according to forecasts is to turn cooler and wetter from wednesday onwards . perhaps more importantly , though , german captain michael ballack 's team needs to keep the germans ' hopes alive of their first european championship title since 1996 by progressing towards the final in vienna on june 29 . " the national eleven also has to contribute , " said huhnholz . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2008 bring on the trash , hamburg tells naples großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is willing to take all this and more the italian city of naples , rocked by a series of garbage crises in recent months , can count on some german help in taking care of the stinky situation . from naples , the italian city with nowhere to dump its rubbish , the freight trains take 44 hours to reach hamburg , a german city that is only too happy to incinerate the stinking mess .
hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .
under european union rules , all household rubbish is supposed to be burned or recycled from next year . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 10.06.2008 germany to help russia destroy chemical weapon stockpile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has the world 's largest chemical weapons arsenal the russian town of pochep is home to a massive stockpile of chemical weapons , some decades old .
too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .

the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is this a trend in the making ? as an old-school footballer , günter netzer is n't usually quick with superlatives .
but even the laconic german playmaker turned sports broadcaster could not help expressing his " huge admiration " for 24-year-old dutchmen wesley sneijder .
the young midfielder was all over the pitch in holland 's 3-0 thrashing of italy on monday , june 9 , winning balls , feeding ruud van nistelrooy for his side 's first goal and scoring the second with a superb volley past arguably the best keeper in the world .
sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?
germany , portugal on the rise bildunterschrift : podolski - a sub at bayern , a star for germany germany 's two biggest stars are miroslav klose and michael ballack .
but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makelele could soon be getting a golden handshake and france , whose goalless draw against romania provided the lowlight of the tournament thus far , is even more ancient .
willy sagnol , lilian thuram , william gallas , claude makelele - all fabulous players in the past - looked riper for retirement than for one last international title .
their combined ages are a century-and-a-third - hardly a statistic that would lead many to believe that les bleus go far in the world 's toughest soccer tournament . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .
" if you had a no vote based on a high turnout , the eu 's back might be forced against the wall , " hugo brady , of the london-based centre for european reform , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
three years ago , voters in france and the netherlands threw the eu into political turmoil by rejecting the grandly-titled constitutional treaty - a text aimed at giving the bloc a new role in the world .
it took member states 18 months of paralysis and a year of all-night wrangling at summits to come up with a replacement - the lisbon treaty which is the subject of thursday 's irish vote .
treaty " crucial to ireland 's future " with polls showing 30 percent of the country 's 3 million voters still undecided , ireland 's three main political parties teamed up at a joint press conference monday , june 9 , to make the case . " for the generation which will shape ireland in the decades ahead , there is unlikely to be another vote as important as this one , " said irish prime minister brian cowen . the treaty , which replaced the doomed eu constitution and must be ratified by all 27 eu nations , was " crucial to ireland 's future prospects , " according to cowen . presenting a united front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ireland stymied 2002 's nice treaty with a ' no ' cowen - who only took over as fianna fail party head and therefore as taoiseach -lrb- pm -rrb- last month - appeared monday alongside fine gael leader enda kenny and labour chief eamon gilmore .
together , the three parties hold 149 seats in the 166-member dail -lrb- lower house -rrb- . kenny said the leaders appeared together to show they were " united , on one of the most important issues facing our country , " and described the referendum as " profoundly important . " " these are uncertain times , both in ireland , and in the global economy , " added gilmore .
" now , more than ever , we need to know where we are going .
we need to send a message that ireland is open for business . " " in an ever more competitive global environment , it is imperative we do n't give the impression that we are turning our back on europe and the policies that have served us so well , " he said . opposition calls for renegotiation only one party with parliamentary representation - nationalist sinn fein with four seats - has opposed the treaty . sinn fein president gerry adams says he wants the government to renegotiate the lisbon treaty to include opt-outs or vetoes on issues like neutrality , public services and workers rights .
canvassing in limerick monday , adams said a " no " vote would send a strong signal , and renegotiation would be possible if there was a " no " vote on thursday , according to reports by broadcaster rte . kenny disagreed , saying it would be irresponsible and wrong for anyone to claim a " no " vote would not have adverse consequences for ireland . " the first victims would be the irish , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy has long been lauded as an example of the benefits of eu membership . gilmore said the treaty would put a damper on what he called " the race to the bottom in workers ' pay and conditions . " island voting meanwhile , voting got underway monday on five islands off the north-western coast , three days before the rest of the country . in total 745 people are entitled to vote on the islands off the coast of county donegal .
arranmore , gola , inishbofin , inishfree and tory traditionally vote early in case bad weather cuts them off , delaying the collection of ballot boxes . the islanders ' votes will be taken by helicopter to the mainland and counted with the remainder of the donegal constituency 's votes on friday . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : match reports spain overwhelm russia to set up final date with germany spain beat italy on penalties to book semi-final spot germany beat turkey 3-2 in dramatic fashion to reach final hiddink leads russia to stunning win over dutch euro 2008 -pipe- 10.06.2008 netherlands crush italy in euro 2008 upset großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands took early control of the game in a stunning euro 2008 upset , the netherlands went on the attack to beat world champions italy 3-0 .
it was the highlight of tournament to date and made up for the scoreless draw between france and romania . day three of the euro provided some of the most entertaining and most lackluster soccer of the tournament to date with two games that could hardly have been more different .
the dutch put on a stunning performance , sinking italy in their opening match of euro 2008 on monday , june 9 .
the team stormed out of the blocks against the azzurri and deservedly went ahead after 26 minutes when ruud van nistelrooy tapped home wesley sneijder 's cross from what appeared a blatantly offside position .
the real madrid striker was onsides thanks to italian defender christian pannuci .
italy was clearly missing the calming influence of the injured fabio cannavaro in defence and fell further behind just five minutes later when sneijder rifled home dirk kuyt 's cross from a narrow angle .
no stopping the oranje bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was not a good night for italian fans a brilliant defense-splitting pass by rafael van der vaart nearly gave van nistelrooy his second of the game two minutes from the break but gianluigi buffon was quickly off his line to block the shot .
italy got their game together after the break - although the dutch remained dangerous on the counter - and nearly reduced the deficit through fabio grosso in the 78th minute while a minute later edwin van der sar saved brilliantly from an andrea pirlo free-kick .
but they could n't stop the dutch from scoring their third as kuyt 's cross found giovanni van bronckhorst and his header was pushed over the line by gianluca zambrotta .
" i would not have dreamed of such a start , " said dutch coach van basten , who went on to downplay his side 's victory .
" i do not think that we are now favorites , even though we played well .
i did not expect such a result because we were playing against italy and they have so much experience and quality . "
france-romania game a sleeper bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch team is well-positioned for quarter finals while the encounter in berne lived up to its billing as clash of two of the world 's top sides , the game in zurich between world cup finalists france and romania , the team that finished ahead of the dutch in qualifying , was a painfully dull affair .
romania failed to create a single goal chance of note in the 90 minutes while france 's best chance fell to karim benzema on 57 minutes but the lyon forward 's tame shot from 18 meters was easily saved by goalkeeper bogdan lobont .
the draw probably helps italy 's chances of progressing as victory against france and romania , which would guarantee the italians a spot in the quarter finals .
" we now need to think about the next two games and concentrate on them , " said italian coach roberto donadoni .
" the nice thing is that we are now playing against romania and that will give us a chance to show our true worth .
we just have to get the three points against them . "
poland loses captain poland 's woes following monday 's 2-0 defeat by germany were compounded by the news that captain maciej zurawski is out for the remaining matches of the group stage .
team doctors said on monday that zurawski sustained a thigh muscle injury in the first half of the game in klagenfurt .
he was replaced at half-time .
zurawski will miss the next games against austria and croatia which makes the polish task even more difficult to advance to the knockout stages .
there was better news for greece coach otto rehhagel with the news that the german will have a full squad to pick from for the defending champions ' group d clash tuesday with sweden in salzburg .
uefa have confirmed that there will be no extra security for wednesday 's tie between switzerland and turkey .
the two sides last met in the return leg of a world cup qualifying playoff in november 2005 when players and officials from both teams engaged in a post-match punch-up . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

too bad , says dw-world 's jefferson chase , that the bracket system pits the best teams against each other too early . for me , the euro 2008 officially started when i filled out an excel file with my match predictions for the office pool .
defending world cup champions italy , i thought , were a good bet to make the finals , and as a dark horse , i figured i 'd take the netherlands .
utter nonsense - as i discovered when i had a closer look at the brackets .
despite facing each other in the group stage , in ultra-tough group c no less , italy and holland would meet in the semi-finals , should both teams progress to the quarterfinals and then win their matches there .
that 's because soccer 's european governing body , uefa , divides the sixteen-team draw into two halves - with the winners and runners up of groups c and d -lrb- and a and b -rrb- playing each other , and then the two survivors meeting up one round later .
holland thus could survive the group of death but still have to beat italy again to reach the finals - which seems a bit harsh .
meanwhile , germany or portugal could cruise to the big show without necessarily having to face another of the top european sides .
soccer should n't copy tennis euro 2008 organizers clearly did n't understand the implications of the system used to determine who plays whom .
the top bracket / bottom bracket system is employed in other sports - most notably tennis .
but in tennis , individual players are seeded with relative precision on the basis of past results so that the system works to prevent the top two seeds from having to lock horns before the final .
soccer ranking systems are n't at all precise .
indeed , at times they 're absurd .
in 2006 , for example , soccer minnows the united states were ranked fourth-best in the world - for reasons inexplicable to everyone concerned , including the americans .
what 's more , in big tournaments , host nations are not only given automatic berths , but also seeded among the top teams .
the nominal top seeds in group b , for instance , are not three-time world champions germany , but co-hosts austria .
the result is three top european sides -lrb- italy , holland and france -rrb- in group c but only one -lrb- germany -rrb- in group b. and this year , the seeding imbalances have been magnified by the brackets .
in need of repair the solution to the skewed system is blindingly obvious - pair up the winners of the group a / b quarterfinals with those from the other two groups .
that way , teams that faced each other in a strong first-round group could only meet again in the final .
it 's difficult to see why uefa failed to see this easy remedy - perhaps the draw was plotted out by mascots trix and flix .
holland 's historic win over italy on june 9 was a great contest between two top teams - and no real fan would object to seeing a sure-to-be-ill-tempered rematch in the final on june 29 .
unfortunately , due to organizational myopia , that fixture is not on the cards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 10.06.2008 germany to help russia destroy chemical weapon stockpile großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has the world 's largest chemical weapons arsenal the russian town of pochep is home to a massive stockpile of chemical weapons , some decades old .
too dangerous to move , germany is helping build a facility in the town which will destroy the arsenal . the human toll caused by chemical warfare has been well documented in conflicts such as world war i , vietnam and the iran-iraq war .
the dangerous weapons have been outlawed since 1997 , when the multilateral chemical weapons convention -lrb- cwc -rrb- entered into force .
strict timelines have since been set for destroying existing chemical weapons .
the 2012 deadline is fast approaching for countries such as russia , which began construction tuesday , june 10 on a new facility that will dispose of the chemical weapons .
relying on german help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world leaders signalled their support at the g8 in 2002 by 2012 , about 7,500 tons of nerve gas - sarin , soman and vx - will have been destroyed in the western russian city of pochep .
the facility in pochep , which will be up and running in 2009 , is the last of seven to be constructed in russia , which has the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world .
the country faces the daunting task of disposing of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons , one quarter of that has already been destroyed , according to valeriy kapashin , the head of the moscow directorate that oversees the destruction of chemical weapons .
the facility in pochep is being built by a german company and is getting german government support to the tune of 140 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- .
germany 's federal office of defense technology and procurement , which has helped russia over the years with its chemical disarmament , will also provide technical support for the new facility .
the real push to get rid of chemical weapons came at a group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in kananaskis , canada in 2002 .
leaders of the world 's most powerful countries said they wanted to form a “ global partnership against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . ”
to do this , g8 members promised to set aside $ 20 billion over the next 10 years to destroy chemical weapons , dismantle decommissioned nuclear submarines and dispose of fissile material .
germany committed $ 1.5 billion to the project .
fear of public protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agent orange causes cancer and birth deformities russia has sought to destroy the chemical weapons in the places where they were stored , as transporting the weapons is expensive and risky , said stephan robinson from the organization green cross .
some of the oldest chemical weapons have been around for six decades and ca n't be transported without considerable risk , robinson said .
green cross has been very active in russia with regional offices located in areas where chemical weapons were produced .
green cross acts as a go-between for the government and residents of the area .
residents are often not happy to learn that chemical weapons have been stored next door for years and will now be destroyed , robinson said .
green cross gets 1.5 million euros each year from western countries .
the group 's job is to “ create an atmosphere that makes chemical weapons destruction at all possible , ” robinson said .
“ when you do n't work with the communities , you risk bad investments in the billions range .
you can have a completed facility that is operational but because of public protests ca n't work . ”
successful destruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few middle eastern countries are holdouts while countries have refused to give up their nuclear weapons , they seem ready to do away with their chemical weapons arsenals .
“ with the advent of the atomic bomb , chemical weapons became a very dull knife , ” said robinson .
nevertheless , a handful of countries have refused to sign the chemical weapons convention .
egypt , israel and syria are holdouts , although the first two seem ready to negotiate over the topic .
syria is refusing to talk , robinson said .
yet he is still pleased about how well most middle east countries have done in getting rid of their chemical weapons .
if the current agreement to rid the world of chemical weapons succeeds , it would be the first time a government had successfully eliminated a system of weapons of mass destruction .
military spending marches on the positive outlook for ridding the world of chemical weapons stands in stark contrast to overall military spending .
globally , military spending grew 45 percent in the past decade , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- said monday .
military spending grew six percent in 2007 year alone , according to sipri 's annual report .
in 2007 , 1.3 trillion dollars -lrb- 851 billion euros -rrb- was spent on arms and other military expenditure , with the united states spending by far the most . dirk eckert -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i trust there will be a serious discussion about the prospects of peace in the middle east , and on whether it will be possible as promised to have a palestinian state by the end of the year , " mussa told a news conference in ljubljana monday .
slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , hosted mussa on a two-day visit just ahead of the eu-us summit to be held tuesday .
" we hope ... there will be a viable real state by the end of the year , " he said .
" this is a question that should be addressed to him -lrb- president bush -rrb- , an appeal that should be expressed . " initial reports , however , suggest that the question of a middle east peace agreement is not on the table at this conference . taking steps toward peace still , the arab league is searching for a resolution . " i think one of the important steps to face -lrb- in this situation -rrb- is for fatah and hamas to close ranks , and this is our -lrb- the arab league 's -rrb- task to achieve , " mussa said . at the same time , mussa accused israel of standing in the way of an accord . " israel does n't seem ready to give anything or enter into a deal , " he said . saudi king abdullah and palestinian president mahmud abbas on sunday agreed that the arab league should oversee truce talks between the palestinian groups fatah and hamas . last week , abbas had called for dialogue with hamas , breaking with his previous policy of rejecting any opening until they cede control of the territory . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .

is this a trend in the making ? as an old-school footballer , günter netzer is n't usually quick with superlatives .
but even the laconic german playmaker turned sports broadcaster could not help expressing his " huge admiration " for 24-year-old dutchmen wesley sneijder .
the young midfielder was all over the pitch in holland 's 3-0 thrashing of italy on monday , june 9 , winning balls , feeding ruud van nistelrooy for his side 's first goal and scoring the second with a superb volley past arguably the best keeper in the world .
sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?
germany , portugal on the rise bildunterschrift : podolski - a sub at bayern , a star for germany germany 's two biggest stars are miroslav klose and michael ballack .
but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makelele could soon be getting a golden handshake and france , whose goalless draw against romania provided the lowlight of the tournament thus far , is even more ancient .
willy sagnol , lilian thuram , william gallas , claude makelele - all fabulous players in the past - looked riper for retirement than for one last international title .

that poll has set nerves jangling in brussels , as experts warn that a rejection of the treaty could throw the eu into confusion .
" there is no plan b : if there was a no , in ireland or in another country , it would have a very negative effect for the eu , " the head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said on may 26 .

is this a trend in the making ? as an old-school footballer , günter netzer is n't usually quick with superlatives .
but even the laconic german playmaker turned sports broadcaster could not help expressing his " huge admiration " for 24-year-old dutchmen wesley sneijder .
the young midfielder was all over the pitch in holland 's 3-0 thrashing of italy on monday , june 9 , winning balls , feeding ruud van nistelrooy for his side 's first goal and scoring the second with a superb volley past arguably the best keeper in the world .
sneijder made italy look old , which is perhaps not all that surprising since , with an average age of around 31 , the squadra azzurra is in fact relatively long in the tooth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's massimo ambrosini was one dejected thirty-something the importance of any one match should not be exaggerated , and italy still have a good chance of progressing in the tournament .
but sneijder 's performance stood in marked contrast to the efforts of italian strikers , luca toni and alessandro del piero , who are 31 and 33 respectively .
could it be that players in their early 20s are simply fresher in the summer , when many of the euro 2008 participants have already played 40 + matches in international , league and national cup competitions ?
germany , portugal on the rise bildunterschrift : podolski - a sub at bayern , a star for germany germany 's two biggest stars are miroslav klose and michael ballack .
but the man of the match in germany 's clear 2-0 win over poland was 23-year-old lukas podolsksi .
normally a striker , podolski adapted swimmingly to being shifted back to the left side of midfield , scoring both of germany 's goals .
but perhaps more impressive than the fact that he , like sneijder , seemed to be everywhere at once on the pitch .
podolski , who struggled to get playing behind klose and toni at bayern munich , looked like he had more gas left in the tank than either of his teammates .
the story is much the same with portugal , who won 2-0 against turkey , with the winning goal coming from 25 year old defender pepe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pepe also had a second goal controversially allowed pepe played a nifty combination with striker nuno gomes , sprinting past the turkish defense to give the stylish portugese the advantage .
pepe was in and out of the starting line-up of real madrid this season , and he certainly was n't suffering from fatigue in his national team 's opener .
france , czechs looking peaked bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koller was listing against switzerland meanwhile , italy is n't the only veteran side that may be asking itself whether it needs an infusion of young blood .
the czech republic were very fortunate to get by the swiss in their first match - and 35 year old striker jan koller in particular seemed like he was on his last legs .
much the same was true with croatia , who only just squeaked past arguably the worst team in the tournament , austria , and whose sibling defense-midfield tandem of robert and niko kovac are a combined 60 years of age .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makelele could soon be getting a golden handshake and france , whose goalless draw against romania provided the lowlight of the tournament thus far , is even more ancient .
willy sagnol , lilian thuram , william gallas , claude makelele - all fabulous players in the past - looked riper for retirement than for one last international title .
their combined ages are a century-and-a-third - hardly a statistic that would lead many to believe that les bleus go far in the world 's toughest soccer tournament . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .
russia created the first clear chance as captain sergei semak played in the overlapping right-back alexsandr anyukov and his pull back found igor semshov but the dinamo moscow man shot tamely wide .
villa and torres combine to deadly effect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torres set up villa for the first goal on 20 minutes russia were made to pay on 20 minutes as fernando torres latched onto a long through ball from joan capdevila , turned his marker denis kolodin , drew goalkeeper igor akinfeev and slipped the ball inside for villa to slot into an empty net .
it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .
iniesta gets in on the act bildunterschrift : david villa sprints onto a canny iniesta pass to slot in his second on 27 minutes a great move from spain almost resulted in another goal as andres iniesta played in villa , who forced akinfeev into a smart near-post save .
but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .
spain then proceeded to hit russia on the counter-attack at will and had several chances to bury the game , including a marcos senna header from a corner that akinfeev punched clear .
hat-trick hero finishes with aplomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa sweeps home goal number three with 15 minutes left , fabregas threaded a through ball to villa and the diminutive striker turned inside his marker before wrong-footing akinfeev .
russia were restricted to taking long range pot shots , although diniyar bilyaletdinov and roman pavlyuchenko both thrashed efforts just past the post.2 however , pavlyuchenko did score a consolation goal with a close range header four minutes from time as spain went to sleep at a corner but another rapier counter attack saw fabregas head home after xavi 's volley was blocked . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

valencia striker david villa was the hat-trick hero but it was spain 's general incisive play that formed the base of this hugely impressive victory .
russia , coached by dutchman guus hiddink , did not play badly - they had a lot of the ball and created chances - but spain were ruthless .

it was stunning vision from capdevila who cut out a russian pass and launched a 60-metre counter-attack in one movement but kolodin should have stopped torres having got a touch as he was turned , only to clumsily give the ball straight back to the liverpool forward .
russia reacted well as konstantin zyryanov hit the post with a shot from 12 yards following confusion in the spanish box but the iberians launched a rapid counter-attack with torres dinking the ball wide with only akinfeev to beat .

but on the stroke of half-time the same pair combined to give spain a 2-0 lead , iniesta brilliantly picking out villa 's run before the valencia marksmen squeezed the ball between akinfeev 's legs .
russia should have been back in the match just after the break but vladimir bystrov directed his free header from a semak cross straight into iker casillas 's grateful grasp .
spain coach luis aragones responded by bringing off torres for arsenal midfielder cesc fabregas to try to close up the middle of the park .

a former executive at eurocopter , the european helicopter manufacturing company , went on trial in germany for allegedly selling documents about the aircraft to russian spies . werner g. admits he took documents from his employer and passed them on to russian intelligence .
but the 44-year-old engineer claims none of the documents were classified .
" he knows he made a huge mistake , " the defendant 's lawyer said at the beginning of the trial in munich on monday , june 9 .
werner g. was an executive at eurocopter , a division of the european aerospace group eads .
he allegedly met with a russian intelligence agent several times between 2004 and 2006 in germany , austria and croatia .
in exchange for manuals , files and cd-roms , werner g. was paid 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,500 -rrb- by the svr , the successor to the kgb .
prosecutors said he used anonymous webmail accounts to arrange meetings to pass over the information .
all information unclassified the defense lawyer said his client , who worked for eurocopter until the late 1990s , only sold unclassified manuals of various civilian eurocopter helicopters .
federal public prosecutor hans-juergen foerster said the boundaries between civilian and military spying were not always clear .
foerster said such technical documents could allow another manufacturer to save development costs and offer its own aircraft at cheaper prices .
" according to what we know currently , the company was not harmed in any way , " an eads spokesman said .
the defendant , who joined the franco-german helicopter company in 1992 , now runs his own engineering consultancy .
he said he had been in debt and hoped the svr man would help him gain business .
he said he was shocked at his arrest in april 2007 .
a verdict in the case is expected next week .

" it is only right that citizens of all the us ' eu allies be given the opportunity to travel visa-free across the atlantic , " said benita ferrero-waldner , the eu commissioner in charge of handling the bloc 's external relations .
the us currently only allows citizens from some countries to enter the us without a visa and has resisted eu efforts to open trans-atlantic travel to everyone in the bloc .
bush wants backup in afghanistan the us has also kept up pressure on european allies to do more in afghanistan and bush seemed likely to continue to press the issue .
the us wants european nations to supply more combat troops for the nato-led security force .
" got a lot of work to do in afghanistan , " bush said monday at the white house before leaving for europe .

bush , merkel to have informal chat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets a big texas welcome at the bush ranch german chancellor angela merkel has a better relationship than most world leaders with bush .
bush and merkel will meet together at the secluded schloss meseberg near berlin after the summt finishes tuesday .
bush has warm feelings for merkel , who he described as " a fine chancellor , whom i 'm proud to call a friend , " a few months after she took office in november , 2005 .
both are right of center politically , basing their politics on self-help , small government and the family unit .
the friendship persists despite clear differences on major international themes .
merkel staunchly advocates cutting greenhouse gas emissions to counter climate change while bush has been reluctant to act . the german chancellor places the united nations at the center of her international politics while the bush presidency has bypassed the un at every crucial point .
merkel is likely to push bush on trade .
the us and europe need to optimize trade conditions in light of competition from china , india and brazil , merkel wrote in a guest column for the center-left daily sueddeutsche zeitung .
" that means effective economic reforms and ambitious innovation , " she said .
trade , weak dollar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dollar just is n't what it used to be a main message bush will bring to europe is his concern about the weak us economy and the fall of the dollar , which has tumbled to record lows against the euro this year .
as he spoke to reporters monday , the euro reached a six-week high of $ 1.5845 .
" i 'll talk about our nation 's commitment to a strong dollar , " he said .
" a strong dollar is in our nation 's interests .
it is in the interests of the global economy . "
rising food and oil prices are also likely to be a theme as bush meets with european leaders .
" the current oil and food price rises show how important the eu-us cooperation is at a global level , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso in a statement monday .

hamburg 's municipal sanitation department has contracted with the italian government 's garbage supremo to destroy 30,000 tons of garbage from campania , the italian region that includes naples , as part of a german promise to burn 160,000 tons for the italians .
money to be made sanitation spokesman reinhard fiedler declined to say what hamburg is charging to transform all that refuse into ash and flue gas .
but he said the work was not being subsidized by hamburg taxpayers .
this tale of two cities illustrates how the germans leaped with enthusiasm a decade ago into hyper-modern waste treatment that tries to see garbage as a useful resource , whereas campania 's own plans fizzled amid corruption and , some say , organized crime .
hamburg , a city of 1.8 million , produces 1 million tons of garbage a year , 700,000 tons of that from private households .
fiedler says about one third is recycled by compost plants and scrap processors .
not enough to go around ?
germans are disciplined at separating packaging and paper from the rest of their rubbish , and this creates business opportunities .
in recent weeks hamburg has been shaken by an ugly row between two parties that are desperate to receive more rubbish , not less .
in a business where the going rate for incineration work is said by industry sources to be 250 to 350 euros -lrb- 392 to 550 dollars -rrb- per ton , hamburg also " imports " rubbish from surrounding states , including 120,000 tons yearly from the state of lower saxony .
italy promises radiation check last week , geiger counters picked up very weak radiation from the italian garbage .
workers discovered rubbish smeared with radioactive iodine 131 , probably from a doctor 's surgery .
italy promptly agreed to check all the rubbish for radiation before it leaves , and hamburg said to keep the refuse coming .
the first pre-checked trainload was set to arrive on tuesday , june 10 in hamburg , where 3,000 tons of weekly incinerator capacity has been reserved for the italians .
whereas that mostly arrives by truck , italy 's long-distance shipments , comprising 500 to 700 tons each , must be hauled by rail in containers over the alps and across the north german plain to a freight yard a couple of kilometers from the incinerator .
trucks carry the naples waste the last two kilometres to giant concrete holding pens , ready for it to enter the incinerator hopper .
no landfills here the plant is in billbrook , a city district mainly occupied by factories where the residents are used to industry .
billbrook 's canals and thickets of birch trees and weeds give it a certain scruffy charm .
compared to landfills , with their rats , screaming seagulls and seeping effluents , it is a clean place .
germany 's move towards 21st-century methods of clearing garbage gathered pace in the 1990s , when many voters became attuned to green policies .
engineers devised low-pollution incinerators and in 1998 , hamburg completely ceased dumping household rubbish in landfills .
as fiedler points out , liquids and gases coming from the former landfills will have to be monitored for generations .
campania 's rubbish exports are meant to create a breathing space so that streets can be cleared and partly built incinerators can be completed .

the move aims to give temporary workers the same rights in areas like holiday and sick pay as permanent colleagues .
the luxembourg talks also confirmed the uk 's opt-out from the working time directive and a maximum 48-hour week .
business secretary john hutton described the 12-hour meeting 's outcome as " a very good deal for britain " .
under the deal , britain 's 1.3 million agency workers will get the same pay and conditions as permanent staff after being employed for 12 weeks .
firm opt-out the government had rejected original eu proposals to grant equal rights from the first day of an agency contract , suggesting temps should have at least one year 's service to qualify .
last month mr hutton accepted a national agreement between the cbi and tuc for parity after 12 weeks which unblocked the stalled eu negotiations . "
it provides a fair deal for workers without damaging britain 's economic competitiveness or putting jobs at risk . "
john hutton in return for dropping their long-standing opposition , british ministers secured a firmer opt-out from the working time directive , which limits workers to 48 hours each week .
mr hutton said the deal retained crucial job market flexibility .
he said : " it provides a fair deal for workers without damaging britain 's economic competitiveness or putting jobs at risk .
" flexibility has been critical to our ability to create an extra three million jobs over the past decade .
that flexibility has been preserved by ensuring workers can continue to have choice over their working hours in future years . "
critics of the deal include small and medium-sized employers who say they will be hit hard by the measures .
a number of eu countries have criticised the british opt-out on working hours .
the measures now go to the european parliament , where there will be attempts to strengthen protection for workers further .

firm opt-out the government had rejected original eu proposals to grant equal rights from the first day of an agency contract , suggesting temps should have at least one year 's service to qualify .
last month mr hutton accepted a national agreement between the cbi and tuc for parity after 12 weeks which unblocked the stalled eu negotiations .
it provides a fair deal for workers without damaging britain 's economic competitiveness or putting jobs at risk .
john hutton in return for dropping their long-standing opposition , british ministers secured a firmer opt-out from the working time directive , which limits workers to 48 hours each week .
mr hutton said the deal retained crucial job market flexibility .
he said : " it provides a fair deal for workers without damaging britain 's economic competitiveness or putting jobs at risk .
" flexibility has been critical to our ability to create an extra three million jobs over the past decade .
that flexibility has been preserved by ensuring workers can continue to have choice over their working hours in future years . "
critics of the deal include small and medium-sized employers who say they will be hit hard by the measures .
a number of eu countries have criticised the british opt-out on working hours .
the measures now go to the european parliament , where there will be attempts to strengthen protection for workers further .

the announcement , expected later today , is part of a 10-year drive to improve the lives of the uk 's 6m carers .
according to the department of health an extra £ 150m will double the amount of respite time available over 2 years .
but charities are disappointed that improvements to carers ' benefits across the uk have not yet been finalised .
it is almost 10 years since the government 's first carers' strategy introduced annual grants for local councils to provide support for carers .
today 's announcement of a new vision for the next 10 years is - according to the health minister , ivan lewis - supposed to reflect the changing needs of our times .
" in a society where an increasing number of us are caring for ageing parents or sick and disabled relatives , it is right that we recognise carers are at the heart of 21st century families and communities , " he said .
" in the next decade elder care will be the new childcare and it is essential our policies properly meet the scale of the challenge .
enhancing support " thousands of carers , irrespective of their roles or postcode , have told us they want a support system that is on their side , rather than a constant struggle and the right to a life of their own alongside their caring responsibilities . "
according to the department of health the new strategy will also include £ 6 million to support professionals to ensure no child has their childhood stolen through taking on inappropriate caring responsibilities .
and £ 38m will help carers who want to combine a job with their caring role .
a further £ 61m will be aimed at enhancing support to voluntary organisations and ensuring nhs and social care professionals focus on the specific emotional and health needs of carers ; for example , there will be pilot schemes to look at ways of providing annual health checks for carers .
carers ' charities are pleased the government is tackling many of the challenges brought on by our ageing population , but one remains unresolved : carers ' allowance at £ 50 a week is the lowest benefit of its kind in the uk .
many carers of working age have to give up paid jobs and many already retired have just small incomes .
imelda redmond from carers uk told bbc news : " there is a need to radically overhaul benefits for carers .
the system is no longer fit for purpose . "
ministers say they want to improve carers' incomes , but any benefits reform has not yet been finalised .
until it is , many carers will give these plans only a cautious welcome .

it was ordered last year by health minister edwina hart after several patients campaigned against decisions to deny them costly medical procedures .
hcw has a budget of almost £ 550m which pays for treatments normally unavailable on the nhs in wales .
the review is likely to be critical of the way it has dealt with patients .
it is expected to highlight a lack of openness in hcw 's decision-making process and recommend a way forward for the beleaguered body , says bbc wales ' health correspondent hywel griffith .
the report will also consider whether hcw is fit for purpose and has enough money to do its jobs of deciding which patients receive which of the huge array of treatments it has control over - ranging from brain surgery to transplants and kidney services to cancer care .
it was n't working as it was and the hardship it was causing patients to have to deal with the political side of things brian powell in the past patients have often found it very difficult to persuade hcw to fund a specialist treatments .
dave powell who applied to hcw to pay for a specialist prostrate treatment called brachytherapy , was refused funding despite the recommendation of two specialists instead , the decorator from barry , vale of glamorgan launched a campaign to get help .
after eight months and four refusals for treatment the commission suddenly relented allowing him to receive the treatment in august 2007 .
in april , the treatment was expanded across wales but mr powell said more needs to be done to make the process of applying for specialist treatment easier and more transparent .
" out of the blue with no explanation health commission wales just phoned and said you can have the treatment , " he explained .
" there was no reason why they came to that conclusion because they refused me four times in the those eight months .
brian powell campaigned for eight months to get the treatment he needed " the hcw definitely needs change .
it was n't working as it was and the hardship it was causing patients to have to deal with the political side of things .
" they do n't need that when they 've got an illness .
it 's extra pressure on them and their families . "
the assembly 's health committee is also expected to publish a report into proposals to cut the number of local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- across wales .
they are expected to drop from 22 to eight with trusts and lhbs directly funded from the assembly government .
the lhbs are currently set up along the same boundaries as local authorities but it is thought this number will be reduced with an admission they have proved too small to work effectively .
a national board is likely to be created to oversee the service complete with new arrangements to maximise public accountability .
the consultation on the changes closes at the end of june with a final decision expected in the autumn .

brian powell campaigned for eight months to get the treatment he needed " the hcw definitely needs change .
it was n't working as it was and the hardship it was causing patients to have to deal with the political side of things .
" they do n't need that when they 've got an illness .
it 's extra pressure on them and their families . "
the assembly 's health committee is also expected to publish a report into proposals to cut the number of local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- across wales .
they are expected to drop from 22 to eight with trusts and lhbs directly funded from the assembly government .
the lhbs are currently set up along the same boundaries as local authorities but it is thought this number will be reduced with an admission they have proved too small to work effectively .
a national board is likely to be created to oversee the service complete with new arrangements to maximise public accountability .
the consultation on the changes closes at the end of june with a final decision expected in the autumn .

crosfield house in rhayader , powys , is the only royal british legion home in wales but a forecast £ 500,000 deficit could force it to close its doors .
powys council is meeting on tuesday to discuss the property which will be followed by a public meeting .
but the council is not expected to vote in favour of providing extra funding .
last month , the royal british legion -lrb- rbl -rrb- told the council it needed to pay 30 % more for its residents at the home , but it said it could not meet such financial demands .
we remain very happy to consider any constructive and realistic proposals from powys and to consider any new proposals that they may have royal british legion unions claim closing the home , which is home to 50 ex-service people and residents , would also lead to the loss of 80 jobs .
the legion said the deficit was due to increased maintenance costs , under-occupancy , the low rates paid by the council and a higher number of local authority-funded residents .
the council said it had been in discussions with the rbl but they had been disappointing .
" officers have provided a range of options to help secure this development , including block residential and nursing care contracts , domiciliary day care provision , and the possibility of them providing extra care housing on site , " said the council .
" to date all of these suggestions have been declined by the rbl .
" in essence , this centres on the fact that the rbl , in order to secure the future of the home , are requesting fee levels which are substantially in excess of what the council currently pays . "
crosfield house is the only royal british legion home in wales the rbl said certain parts of crosfield house fell short of the standards " required under the care standards act 2000 " , such as the lavatories and washing facilities .
a spokeswoman added : " we have to adhere to the legislative standards which have now been set for some years .
" up ' til now we have been given special dispensation , but we now have to invest to meet the standards set by the government .
" the royal british legion opened discussions with powys council and residents , relatives and staff last october .
" we remain very happy to consider any constructive and realistic proposals from powys and to consider any new proposals that they may have - within the timescale we have set . "
a 30-day consultation period has also started where both parties have been asked to put forward suggestions for saving the home .
their ideas will be passed on to the home 's board of trustees who will discuss the findings at a meeting on 26 june .

but the report , commissioned by the airport on the health impacts of the plans , said there would be a negligible increase in pollution levels .
the airport 's acting managing director , joe kelly , said a team would work to find ways of lessening the impact .
campaigners oppose the plans submitted to the borough council in january .
the application , sent to solihull council , would see the runway extended 405m -lrb- 1,329ft -rrb- towards bickenhill and hampton-in-arden , in warwickshire .
the airport said it means it would be able to accommodate larger aircraft and operate more long haul routes , including direct flights to china and the west coast of america .
' aircraft emissions ' it has commissioned two reports which look at how people would be affected by the plans .
mr kelly said : " we will take the reports and with the professionals create the greater health management plan and that health management plan will then ensure that the negatives are mitigated and the positives are enhanced . "
however , friends of the earth and the birmingham airport anti-noise group -lrb- bang -rrb- have teamed up to protest to the council , saying the expansion is detrimental to the environment and to residents .
they claim the number of people exposed to aircraft noise pollution would double and that aircraft carbon dioxide emissions would treble .

but the report , commissioned by the airport on the health impacts of the plans , said there would be a negligible increase in pollution levels .
the airport 's acting managing director , joe kelly , said a team would work to find ways of lessening the impact .
campaigners oppose the plans submitted to the borough council in january .
the application , sent to solihull council , would see the runway extended 405m -lrb- 1,329ft -rrb- towards bickenhill and hampton-in-arden , in warwickshire .
the airport said it means it would be able to accommodate larger aircraft and operate more long haul routes , including direct flights to china and the west coast of america .
' aircraft emissions ' it has commissioned two reports which look at how people would be affected by the plans .
mr kelly said : " we will take the reports and with the professionals create the greater health management plan and that health management plan will then ensure that the negatives are mitigated and the positives are enhanced . "
however , friends of the earth and the birmingham airport anti-noise group -lrb- bang -rrb- have teamed up to protest to the council , saying the expansion is detrimental to the environment and to residents .
they claim the number of people exposed to aircraft noise pollution would double and that aircraft carbon dioxide emissions would treble .

historic scotland said the project was the most ambitious phase of its plans to conserve the castle 's history .
the work will involve the refurbishment of six halls in the royal palace .
the restoration will also see the stirling heads , a collection of hand-carved oak medallions measuring up to a metre in diameter , go on display .

he added : " we have so far completed the refurbishment of the great hall and the chapel royal .
this phase will help emphasise the grandeur of the palace , the royal lodgings and james v 's aspiration to create a scottish court of european importance . "
those behind the project hope it will increase the castle 's visitor numbers from about 386,000 last year to nearly half a million in the future .
the work is being completed thanks to a £ 9m investment from historic scotland and £ 3m from the scottish government .

last month , police officers in england and wales voted by an overwhelming majority to lobby the government for the right to strike .
what is the row over ?
last year home secretary jacqui smith decided not to backdate to september a 2.5 % pay rise for police in england , wales and northern ireland .
the police say this means their rise , only paid from december 2007 , in reality amounts to 1.9 % and that the home office has therefore breached an agreed deal .
in other words , the dispute is not over the increase set by the police arbitration tribunal , but the manner in which the home office has decided to pay it .
what are officers paid at the moment ?
prior to this rise , new police constables began on £ 21,009 .
at the moment this could rise to £ 32,985 , depending on length of service .
the pay increase sees all constables paid a minimum of £ 21,500 , with those with the longest service receiving £ 33,800 .
the home office says constables have seen a 36 % wage increase since 1997 , which is 10 % above inflation .
sergeants currently start on £ 32,985 , and inspectors on £ 42,264 .
superintendents begin on £ 56,274 , rising to £ 65,565 and chief superintendents have a starting salary of £ 67,200 , rising to £ 71,031 .
why did the government decide to delay the police pay rise ?
prime minister gordon brown decided to stage public sector pay rises when he was still chancellor .
he said staging pay awards was an " essential part " of controlling inflation , keeping interest rates low and creating more jobs .
he also said he would " do nothing " that he believed would put economic stability or low interest rates at risk .
however , officers in scotland have had the full award as scottish ministers have accepted the decision of the police arbitration tribunal .
can police strike ?
no .
the police are banned striking by an act of parliament .
however , some members of the police federation are now calling for this ban to be removed because they say they are now being treated the same as other public sector workers - and should therefore have the same rights .
can police take any form of protest action ?
thousands of police officers from across the country have organised a protest march in london over the issue .
the police federation is also warning that it plans to ballot officers over whether they want to seek full industrial rights .
that vote may happen in february .
chris herbert , editor of police review , said there were a few " fairly limited " ways in which the police could express their anger .
he said : " they could go back to their members to see if they wanted to take a ballot on whether they should have the right to strike or not .
" that could be the most high-profile , headline-grabbing thing they could do .
" or they could withdraw their labour for voluntary posts or jobs that come up .
or they could do what 's called working to minimum standards .
this would see officers following procedures " to the absolute minute , so it in a sense jams up the system , so that all the jobs they have to do would take a lot longer " .
is this dispute a one-off ?
no , the row is part of a much larger dispute .
since 1980 , pay has been set after talks in a special industrial relations body called the police negotiating board .

last month , police officers in england and wales voted by an overwhelming majority to lobby the government for the right to strike .
what is the row over ?
last year home secretary jacqui smith decided not to backdate to september a 2.5 % pay rise for police in england , wales and northern ireland .
the police say this means their rise , only paid from december 2007 , in reality amounts to 1.9 % and that the home office has therefore breached an agreed deal .
in other words , the dispute is not over the increase set by the police arbitration tribunal , but the manner in which the home office has decided to pay it .
what are officers paid at the moment ?
prior to this rise , new police constables began on £ 21,009 .
at the moment this could rise to £ 32,985 , depending on length of service .
the pay increase sees all constables paid a minimum of £ 21,500 , with those with the longest service receiving £ 33,800 .
the home office says constables have seen a 36 % wage increase since 1997 , which is 10 % above inflation .
sergeants currently start on £ 32,985 , and inspectors on £ 42,264 .
superintendents begin on £ 56,274 , rising to £ 65,565 and chief superintendents have a starting salary of £ 67,200 , rising to £ 71,031 .
why did the government decide to delay the police pay rise ?
prime minister gordon brown decided to stage public sector pay rises when he was still chancellor .
he said staging pay awards was an " essential part " of controlling inflation , keeping interest rates low and creating more jobs .
he also said he would " do nothing " that he believed would put economic stability or low interest rates at risk .
however , officers in scotland have had the full award as scottish ministers have accepted the decision of the police arbitration tribunal .
can police strike ?
no .
the police are banned striking by an act of parliament .
however , some members of the police federation are now calling for this ban to be removed because they say they are now being treated the same as other public sector workers - and should therefore have the same rights .
can police take any form of protest action ?
thousands of police officers from across the country have organised a protest march in london over the issue .
the police federation is also warning that it plans to ballot officers over whether they want to seek full industrial rights .
that vote may happen in february .
chris herbert , editor of police review , said there were a few " fairly limited " ways in which the police could express their anger .
he said : " they could go back to their members to see if they wanted to take a ballot on whether they should have the right to strike or not .
" that could be the most high-profile , headline-grabbing thing they could do .
" or they could withdraw their labour for voluntary posts or jobs that come up .
or they could do what 's called working to minimum standards .
this would see officers following procedures " to the absolute minute , so it in a sense jams up the system , so that all the jobs they have to do would take a lot longer " .
is this dispute a one-off ?
no , the row is part of a much larger dispute .
since 1980 , pay has been set after talks in a special industrial relations body called the police negotiating board .
the police federation supports the pnb , saying it provides a good negotiating environment with both sides around the table .
secondly , if the two sides fail to agree , the matter is referred to the independent police arbitration tribunal for a binding decision .
there has been no dispute for years because both sides have abided by its rulings .

last month , police officers in england and wales voted by an overwhelming majority to lobby the government for the right to strike .
what is the row over ?
last year home secretary jacqui smith decided not to backdate to september a 2.5 % pay rise for police in england , wales and northern ireland .
the police say this means their rise , only paid from december 2007 , in reality amounts to 1.9 % and that the home office has therefore breached an agreed deal .
in other words , the dispute is not over the increase set by the police arbitration tribunal , but the manner in which the home office has decided to pay it .
what are officers paid at the moment ?
prior to this rise , new police constables began on £ 21,009 .
at the moment this could rise to £ 32,985 , depending on length of service .
the pay increase sees all constables paid a minimum of £ 21,500 , with those with the longest service receiving £ 33,800 .
the home office says constables have seen a 36 % wage increase since 1997 , which is 10 % above inflation .
sergeants currently start on £ 32,985 , and inspectors on £ 42,264 .
superintendents begin on £ 56,274 , rising to £ 65,565 and chief superintendents have a starting salary of £ 67,200 , rising to £ 71,031 .
why did the government decide to delay the police pay rise ?
prime minister gordon brown decided to stage public sector pay rises when he was still chancellor .
he said staging pay awards was an " essential part " of controlling inflation , keeping interest rates low and creating more jobs .
he also said he would " do nothing " that he believed would put economic stability or low interest rates at risk .
however , officers in scotland have had the full award as scottish ministers have accepted the decision of the police arbitration tribunal .
can police strike ?
no .
the police are banned striking by an act of parliament .
however , some members of the police federation are now calling for this ban to be removed because they say they are now being treated the same as other public sector workers - and should therefore have the same rights .
can police take any form of protest action ?
thousands of police officers from across the country have organised a protest march in london over the issue .
the police federation is also warning that it plans to ballot officers over whether they want to seek full industrial rights .
that vote may happen in february .
chris herbert , editor of police review , said there were a few " fairly limited " ways in which the police could express their anger .
he said : " they could go back to their members to see if they wanted to take a ballot on whether they should have the right to strike or not .
" that could be the most high-profile , headline-grabbing thing they could do .
" or they could withdraw their labour for voluntary posts or jobs that come up .
or they could do what 's called working to minimum standards .
this would see officers following procedures " to the absolute minute , so it in a sense jams up the system , so that all the jobs they have to do would take a lot longer " .
is this dispute a one-off ?
no , the row is part of a much larger dispute .
since 1980 , pay has been set after talks in a special industrial relations body called the police negotiating board .
the police federation supports the pnb , saying it provides a good negotiating environment with both sides around the table .
secondly , if the two sides fail to agree , the matter is referred to the independent police arbitration tribunal for a binding decision .
there has been no dispute for years because both sides have abided by its rulings .
so what went wrong ?
the home office said it wanted to replace this system with a pay review body closer to those in other areas of the public services , partly because of the need to keep public spending in check .
but the federation warned that such a body would ultimately ignore a principle of police pay - that they are no ordinary public servants .
ultimately a standard pay review body would not have the support of officers , it claimed .
the government 's first move away from the old system went to arbitration after months of deadlock and ultimately led to the current crisis .
the home secretary has commissioned a further report into police pay .
it is understood to recommend the public sector-style pay body that the government wants - but the detail has not yet been made public .
chancellor of the exchequer alastair darling has also floated the idea of three-year pay deals , similar to how other public sector spending is broadly set .
unions have not ruled it out - but are worried that living standards could slip if inflation were to outstrip the agreed awards .
