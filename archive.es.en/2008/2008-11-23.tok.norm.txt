but one german state has demanded climate protection rules be watered down to protect carmakers - and jobs . the european union 's planned support package for the 27-member bloc 's industrial sector would not provide automakers with special subsidies , guenther verheugen , the bloc 's industry commissioner , said in an interview on sunday , nov .
23 . " we have a single industrial policy in europe and it has clearly left behind the use of subsidies , " he told german broadcaster ndr .
" and there wo n't be a reoccurrence of the subsidy mentality of the 80s . " verheugen added that the only industry rescue package considered by the eu was one involving the expansion of credit lines provided by the european investment bank .
such new loans would help carmakers adopt climate-friendly technology and produce cleaner cars . " the manufacturers will have to make major investments to meet the guidelines set by politicians in regards to lower consumption and lower pollution cars , " he said . the european union has called on european automakers to reduce carbon dioxide exhaust levels in their fleets down from an average of 160 g / km to 130 g / km by 2012 . bavaria wants slacker rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants penalties eliminated for carmakers who do n't meet eu limits but it 's the climate protection guidelines that bavarian premier horst seehofer said need to be reexamined in the face of the ongoing economic crisis . " the eu 's co2 reduction goals have to be formed in a way that no jobs are put in danger , " the ruling bavarian coalition , made up of seehofer 's christian social union and the free-market liberal fdp , wrote in an open letter to chancellor angela merkel on sunday . home to giant german automakers including bmw and audi , bavaria 's seehofer said the automobile climate restrictions needed to be lowered in smaller steps . " the automobile industry needs more room to maneuver , " he told the mass-market weekly bild am sonntag .
" and the disastrous financial penalties need to be eliminated .
what good are millions of euros in penalties if it means all the jobs are eliminated ? " the european commission is to present an economic stimulus program on wednesday , worth 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- according to the german government . " some are arguing that , given the very difficult economic situation , we can no longer afford our climate change and energy package , " the chief of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said in lisbon on friday .
" they could not be more wrong ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one german state has demanded climate protection rules be watered down to protect carmakers - and jobs . the european union 's planned support package for the 27-member bloc 's industrial sector would not provide automakers with special subsidies , guenther verheugen , the bloc 's industry commissioner , said in an interview on sunday , nov .

" and there wo n't be a reoccurrence of the subsidy mentality of the 80s . " verheugen added that the only industry rescue package considered by the eu was one involving the expansion of credit lines provided by the european investment bank .
such new loans would help carmakers adopt climate-friendly technology and produce cleaner cars . " the manufacturers will have to make major investments to meet the guidelines set by politicians in regards to lower consumption and lower pollution cars , " he said . the european union has called on european automakers to reduce carbon dioxide exhaust levels in their fleets down from an average of 160 g / km to 130 g / km by 2012 . bavaria wants slacker rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants penalties eliminated for carmakers who do n't meet eu limits but it 's the climate protection guidelines that bavarian premier horst seehofer said need to be reexamined in the face of the ongoing economic crisis .

" the automobile industry needs more room to maneuver , " he told the mass-market weekly bild am sonntag .
" and the disastrous financial penalties need to be eliminated .

recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?

you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .

recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .

now , a year after revealing her transsexuality , she has completed gender reassignment surgery . the sky is wide open for yvonne buschbaum , who feels the lightness of being after undergoing extensive surgery to become the man he always felt he was .
now , the athlete goes by the name balian buschbaum .
" courage is the road to freedom , " said a recent diary entry on his web site .
" i woke up in complete freedom today .
the sky is wide open . "
buschbaum is not ready yet for interviews as " i am still flying on my clouds of freedom and wo n't land until the end the november , at the earliest . "
the necessary operations have also taken a toll on the 28-year-old .
" he is still a little weak from the surgery , " said buschbaum 's former coach herbert czingon .
" but he can get up and is upbeat that he can leave for home on the weekend . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buschbaum stays fit and helps other pole vaulters train in mainz a year has passed since buschbaum revealed that she felt like a man trapped in a women 's body and would undergo the gender change to find her personal freedom .
she appeared in television talk shows and also won respect in the athletics scene for her courage .
but the medical implications of the gender change - the use of doping substances - required buschbaum to quit pole vaulting , with european championship bronze medals from 1998 and 2002 the best results for the athlete with a personal best of 4.70 meters .
shortly-cropped hair always made buschbaum look boyish , but now facial hair and muscles are growing , and the voice is deeper .
buschbaum also has a new id card as balian buschbaum .
starting a new life " some friends wished me happy birthday , " she said in her diary shortly before christmas 2007 as the treatment started .
" as if the first testosterone shot was my second birthday .
it was the start of a new life . "
things have gone well even though buschbaum is at time a little unnerved by the wait for further treatment .
the use of testosterone has also given him a unique outlook at the doping issue because , as he says , he is living these changes through the use of banned steroids . buschbaum is keeping fit by training for an upcoming new role as pole vault coach at the usc mainz club in central germany . " i wanted to leave my sport behind but i am more addicted to the drug that is pole vaulting than i thought , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , of a " difficult decision . "
he said former germany defender markus babbel was now in charge and would hopefully " bring the team back on to the road of success . " babbel was an assistant coach in stuttgart after ending his career as a player there in 2007 .
he is now team manager while the daily training is to be conducted by rainer widmaier . veh , 47 , replaced giovanni trapattoni at stuttgart in february 2006 and led them to a surprise bundesliga title in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have n't always impressed since winning the league in 2007 stuttgart finished sixth last season but are now suffering through a poor campaign .
the team has slumped to 11th place with a winless run of four games and just one victory in the last seven league matches . " it was a difficult decision for all they -lrb- veh and assistant alfons higl -rrb- achieved over the past three years , " said staudt . veh admitted on thursday that he was to blame as well along with other club officials for not having brought the right new players to the club after the 2007 title . " i ca n't lash out at the team because i made mistakes as well , " he said . but veh had urged his team around germany players mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger to reverse the negative trend in wolfsburg instead of going down 4-1 at the team of felix magath , himself a former stuttgart coach . major matches ahead the task to motivate the players now lies with babbel who has little time as stuttgart have a uefa cup date at italian club sampdoria on thursday and host schalke 04 in the bundesliga on sunday . " i talked to the team this morning and told the players that they must live up to their potential , " said staudt " the separation from armin veh is no alibi for the players .

23 , of a " difficult decision . "
he said former germany defender markus babbel was now in charge and would hopefully " bring the team back on to the road of success . " babbel was an assistant coach in stuttgart after ending his career as a player there in 2007 .
he is now team manager while the daily training is to be conducted by rainer widmaier . veh , 47 , replaced giovanni trapattoni at stuttgart in february 2006 and led them to a surprise bundesliga title in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have n't always impressed since winning the league in 2007 stuttgart finished sixth last season but are now suffering through a poor campaign .
the team has slumped to 11th place with a winless run of four games and just one victory in the last seven league matches . " it was a difficult decision for all they -lrb- veh and assistant alfons higl -rrb- achieved over the past three years , " said staudt . veh admitted on thursday that he was to blame as well along with other club officials for not having brought the right new players to the club after the 2007 title . " i ca n't lash out at the team because i made mistakes as well , " he said . but veh had urged his team around germany players mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger to reverse the negative trend in wolfsburg instead of going down 4-1 at the team of felix magath , himself a former stuttgart coach . major matches ahead the task to motivate the players now lies with babbel who has little time as stuttgart have a uefa cup date at italian club sampdoria on thursday and host schalke 04 in the bundesliga on sunday . " i talked to the team this morning and told the players that they must live up to their potential , " said staudt " the separation from armin veh is no alibi for the players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one german state has demanded climate protection rules be watered down to protect carmakers - and jobs . the european union 's planned support package for the 27-member bloc 's industrial sector would not provide automakers with special subsidies , guenther verheugen , the bloc 's industry commissioner , said in an interview on sunday , nov .
23 . " we have a single industrial policy in europe and it has clearly left behind the use of subsidies , " he told german broadcaster ndr .
" and there wo n't be a reoccurrence of the subsidy mentality of the 80s . " verheugen added that the only industry rescue package considered by the eu was one involving the expansion of credit lines provided by the european investment bank .
such new loans would help carmakers adopt climate-friendly technology and produce cleaner cars . " the manufacturers will have to make major investments to meet the guidelines set by politicians in regards to lower consumption and lower pollution cars , " he said . the european union has called on european automakers to reduce carbon dioxide exhaust levels in their fleets down from an average of 160 g / km to 130 g / km by 2012 . bavaria wants slacker rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants penalties eliminated for carmakers who do n't meet eu limits but it 's the climate protection guidelines that bavarian premier horst seehofer said need to be reexamined in the face of the ongoing economic crisis . " the eu 's co2 reduction goals have to be formed in a way that no jobs are put in danger , " the ruling bavarian coalition , made up of seehofer 's christian social union and the free-market liberal fdp , wrote in an open letter to chancellor angela merkel on sunday . home to giant german automakers including bmw and audi , bavaria 's seehofer said the automobile climate restrictions needed to be lowered in smaller steps . " the automobile industry needs more room to maneuver , " he told the mass-market weekly bild am sonntag .
" and the disastrous financial penalties need to be eliminated .
what good are millions of euros in penalties if it means all the jobs are eliminated ? " the european commission is to present an economic stimulus program on wednesday , worth 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- according to the german government . " some are arguing that , given the very difficult economic situation , we can no longer afford our climate change and energy package , " the chief of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said in lisbon on friday .
" they could not be more wrong ...
the consequences of ignoring the risks of climate change will be even greater than the consequences of ignoring risks from the financial sector . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a year after revealing her transsexuality , she has completed gender reassignment surgery . the sky is wide open for yvonne buschbaum , who feels the lightness of being after undergoing extensive surgery to become the man he always felt he was .
now , the athlete goes by the name balian buschbaum .
" courage is the road to freedom , " said a recent diary entry on his web site .
" i woke up in complete freedom today .

buschbaum is not ready yet for interviews as " i am still flying on my clouds of freedom and wo n't land until the end the november , at the earliest . "

she appeared in television talk shows and also won respect in the athletics scene for her courage .
but the medical implications of the gender change - the use of doping substances - required buschbaum to quit pole vaulting , with european championship bronze medals from 1998 and 2002 the best results for the athlete with a personal best of 4.70 meters .

but one german state has demanded climate protection rules be watered down to protect carmakers - and jobs . the european union 's planned support package for the 27-member bloc 's industrial sector would not provide automakers with special subsidies , guenther verheugen , the bloc 's industry commissioner , said in an interview on sunday , nov .
23 . " we have a single industrial policy in europe and it has clearly left behind the use of subsidies , " he told german broadcaster ndr .
" and there wo n't be a reoccurrence of the subsidy mentality of the 80s . " verheugen added that the only industry rescue package considered by the eu was one involving the expansion of credit lines provided by the european investment bank .
such new loans would help carmakers adopt climate-friendly technology and produce cleaner cars . " the manufacturers will have to make major investments to meet the guidelines set by politicians in regards to lower consumption and lower pollution cars , " he said . the european union has called on european automakers to reduce carbon dioxide exhaust levels in their fleets down from an average of 160 g / km to 130 g / km by 2012 . bavaria wants slacker rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants penalties eliminated for carmakers who do n't meet eu limits but it 's the climate protection guidelines that bavarian premier horst seehofer said need to be reexamined in the face of the ongoing economic crisis . " the eu 's co2 reduction goals have to be formed in a way that no jobs are put in danger , " the ruling bavarian coalition , made up of seehofer 's christian social union and the free-market liberal fdp , wrote in an open letter to chancellor angela merkel on sunday . home to giant german automakers including bmw and audi , bavaria 's seehofer said the automobile climate restrictions needed to be lowered in smaller steps . " the automobile industry needs more room to maneuver , " he told the mass-market weekly bild am sonntag .
" and the disastrous financial penalties need to be eliminated .
what good are millions of euros in penalties if it means all the jobs are eliminated ? " the european commission is to present an economic stimulus program on wednesday , worth 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- according to the german government . " some are arguing that , given the very difficult economic situation , we can no longer afford our climate change and energy package , " the chief of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said in lisbon on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a year after revealing her transsexuality , she has completed gender reassignment surgery . the sky is wide open for yvonne buschbaum , who feels the lightness of being after undergoing extensive surgery to become the man he always felt he was .
now , the athlete goes by the name balian buschbaum .
" courage is the road to freedom , " said a recent diary entry on his web site .
" i woke up in complete freedom today .
the sky is wide open . "
buschbaum is not ready yet for interviews as " i am still flying on my clouds of freedom and wo n't land until the end the november , at the earliest . "
the necessary operations have also taken a toll on the 28-year-old .
" he is still a little weak from the surgery , " said buschbaum 's former coach herbert czingon .
" but he can get up and is upbeat that he can leave for home on the weekend . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buschbaum stays fit and helps other pole vaulters train in mainz a year has passed since buschbaum revealed that she felt like a man trapped in a women 's body and would undergo the gender change to find her personal freedom .
she appeared in television talk shows and also won respect in the athletics scene for her courage .
but the medical implications of the gender change - the use of doping substances - required buschbaum to quit pole vaulting , with european championship bronze medals from 1998 and 2002 the best results for the athlete with a personal best of 4.70 meters .
shortly-cropped hair always made buschbaum look boyish , but now facial hair and muscles are growing , and the voice is deeper .
buschbaum also has a new id card as balian buschbaum .
starting a new life " some friends wished me happy birthday , " she said in her diary shortly before christmas 2007 as the treatment started .
" as if the first testosterone shot was my second birthday .
it was the start of a new life . "
things have gone well even though buschbaum is at time a little unnerved by the wait for further treatment .
the use of testosterone has also given him a unique outlook at the doping issue because , as he says , he is living these changes through the use of banned steroids . buschbaum is keeping fit by training for an upcoming new role as pole vault coach at the usc mainz club in central germany . " i wanted to leave my sport behind but i am more addicted to the drug that is pole vaulting than i thought , " he said . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one german state has demanded climate protection rules be watered down to protect carmakers - and jobs . the european union 's planned support package for the 27-member bloc 's industrial sector would not provide automakers with special subsidies , guenther verheugen , the bloc 's industry commissioner , said in an interview on sunday , nov .
23 . " we have a single industrial policy in europe and it has clearly left behind the use of subsidies , " he told german broadcaster ndr .
" and there wo n't be a reoccurrence of the subsidy mentality of the 80s . " verheugen added that the only industry rescue package considered by the eu was one involving the expansion of credit lines provided by the european investment bank .
such new loans would help carmakers adopt climate-friendly technology and produce cleaner cars . " the manufacturers will have to make major investments to meet the guidelines set by politicians in regards to lower consumption and lower pollution cars , " he said . the european union has called on european automakers to reduce carbon dioxide exhaust levels in their fleets down from an average of 160 g / km to 130 g / km by 2012 . bavaria wants slacker rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants penalties eliminated for carmakers who do n't meet eu limits but it 's the climate protection guidelines that bavarian premier horst seehofer said need to be reexamined in the face of the ongoing economic crisis . " the eu 's co2 reduction goals have to be formed in a way that no jobs are put in danger , " the ruling bavarian coalition , made up of seehofer 's christian social union and the free-market liberal fdp , wrote in an open letter to chancellor angela merkel on sunday . home to giant german automakers including bmw and audi , bavaria 's seehofer said the automobile climate restrictions needed to be lowered in smaller steps . " the automobile industry needs more room to maneuver , " he told the mass-market weekly bild am sonntag .
" and the disastrous financial penalties need to be eliminated .
what good are millions of euros in penalties if it means all the jobs are eliminated ? " the european commission is to present an economic stimulus program on wednesday , worth 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- according to the german government . " some are arguing that , given the very difficult economic situation , we can no longer afford our climate change and energy package , " the chief of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said in lisbon on friday .
" they could not be more wrong ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .

we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .

23 , of a " difficult decision . "
he said former germany defender markus babbel was now in charge and would hopefully " bring the team back on to the road of success . " babbel was an assistant coach in stuttgart after ending his career as a player there in 2007 .

" i talked to the team this morning and told the players that they must live up to their potential , " said staudt " the separation from armin veh is no alibi for the players .

23 , of a " difficult decision . "
he said former germany defender markus babbel was now in charge and would hopefully " bring the team back on to the road of success . " babbel was an assistant coach in stuttgart after ending his career as a player there in 2007 .
he is now team manager while the daily training is to be conducted by rainer widmaier . veh , 47 , replaced giovanni trapattoni at stuttgart in february 2006 and led them to a surprise bundesliga title in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have n't always impressed since winning the league in 2007 stuttgart finished sixth last season but are now suffering through a poor campaign .
the team has slumped to 11th place with a winless run of four games and just one victory in the last seven league matches . " it was a difficult decision for all they -lrb- veh and assistant alfons higl -rrb- achieved over the past three years , " said staudt . veh admitted on thursday that he was to blame as well along with other club officials for not having brought the right new players to the club after the 2007 title . " i ca n't lash out at the team because i made mistakes as well , " he said . but veh had urged his team around germany players mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger to reverse the negative trend in wolfsburg instead of going down 4-1 at the team of felix magath , himself a former stuttgart coach . major matches ahead the task to motivate the players now lies with babbel who has little time as stuttgart have a uefa cup date at italian club sampdoria on thursday and host schalke 04 in the bundesliga on sunday . " i talked to the team this morning and told the players that they must live up to their potential , " said staudt " the separation from armin veh is no alibi for the players .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .

recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.11.2008 string of disappointments sends stuttgart 's veh packing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : veh said he understood the team 's decision vfb stuttgart fired coach armin veh on after a string of poor bundesliga results culminated in a 4-1 hammering at vfl wolfsburg . stuttgart president erwin staudt spoke sunday , nov .
23 , of a " difficult decision . "
he said former germany defender markus babbel was now in charge and would hopefully " bring the team back on to the road of success . " babbel was an assistant coach in stuttgart after ending his career as a player there in 2007 .
he is now team manager while the daily training is to be conducted by rainer widmaier . veh , 47 , replaced giovanni trapattoni at stuttgart in february 2006 and led them to a surprise bundesliga title in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have n't always impressed since winning the league in 2007 stuttgart finished sixth last season but are now suffering through a poor campaign .
the team has slumped to 11th place with a winless run of four games and just one victory in the last seven league matches . " it was a difficult decision for all they -lrb- veh and assistant alfons higl -rrb- achieved over the past three years , " said staudt . veh admitted on thursday that he was to blame as well along with other club officials for not having brought the right new players to the club after the 2007 title .

recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .

" and there wo n't be a reoccurrence of the subsidy mentality of the 80s . " verheugen added that the only industry rescue package considered by the eu was one involving the expansion of credit lines provided by the european investment bank .
such new loans would help carmakers adopt climate-friendly technology and produce cleaner cars . " the manufacturers will have to make major investments to meet the guidelines set by politicians in regards to lower consumption and lower pollution cars , " he said . the european union has called on european automakers to reduce carbon dioxide exhaust levels in their fleets down from an average of 160 g / km to 130 g / km by 2012 . bavaria wants slacker rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants penalties eliminated for carmakers who do n't meet eu limits but it 's the climate protection guidelines that bavarian premier horst seehofer said need to be reexamined in the face of the ongoing economic crisis .

" the automobile industry needs more room to maneuver , " he told the mass-market weekly bild am sonntag .
" and the disastrous financial penalties need to be eliminated .
what good are millions of euros in penalties if it means all the jobs are eliminated ? " the european commission is to present an economic stimulus program on wednesday , worth 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- according to the german government . " some are arguing that , given the very difficult economic situation , we can no longer afford our climate change and energy package , " the chief of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said in lisbon on friday .

but one german state has demanded climate protection rules be watered down to protect carmakers - and jobs . the european union 's planned support package for the 27-member bloc 's industrial sector would not provide automakers with special subsidies , guenther verheugen , the bloc 's industry commissioner , said in an interview on sunday , nov .
23 . " we have a single industrial policy in europe and it has clearly left behind the use of subsidies , " he told german broadcaster ndr .
" and there wo n't be a reoccurrence of the subsidy mentality of the 80s . " verheugen added that the only industry rescue package considered by the eu was one involving the expansion of credit lines provided by the european investment bank .
such new loans would help carmakers adopt climate-friendly technology and produce cleaner cars . " the manufacturers will have to make major investments to meet the guidelines set by politicians in regards to lower consumption and lower pollution cars , " he said . the european union has called on european automakers to reduce carbon dioxide exhaust levels in their fleets down from an average of 160 g / km to 130 g / km by 2012 . bavaria wants slacker rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer wants penalties eliminated for carmakers who do n't meet eu limits but it 's the climate protection guidelines that bavarian premier horst seehofer said need to be reexamined in the face of the ongoing economic crisis . " the eu 's co2 reduction goals have to be formed in a way that no jobs are put in danger , " the ruling bavarian coalition , made up of seehofer 's christian social union and the free-market liberal fdp , wrote in an open letter to chancellor angela merkel on sunday . home to giant german automakers including bmw and audi , bavaria 's seehofer said the automobile climate restrictions needed to be lowered in smaller steps . " the automobile industry needs more room to maneuver , " he told the mass-market weekly bild am sonntag .
" and the disastrous financial penalties need to be eliminated .
what good are millions of euros in penalties if it means all the jobs are eliminated ? " the european commission is to present an economic stimulus program on wednesday , worth 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 162 billion -rrb- according to the german government . " some are arguing that , given the very difficult economic situation , we can no longer afford our climate change and energy package , " the chief of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , said in lisbon on friday .
" they could not be more wrong ...
the consequences of ignoring the risks of climate change will be even greater than the consequences of ignoring risks from the financial sector . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , a year after revealing her transsexuality , she has completed gender reassignment surgery . the sky is wide open for yvonne buschbaum , who feels the lightness of being after undergoing extensive surgery to become the man he always felt he was .
now , the athlete goes by the name balian buschbaum .
" courage is the road to freedom , " said a recent diary entry on his web site .
" i woke up in complete freedom today .
the sky is wide open . "
buschbaum is not ready yet for interviews as " i am still flying on my clouds of freedom and wo n't land until the end the november , at the earliest . "
the necessary operations have also taken a toll on the 28-year-old .
" he is still a little weak from the surgery , " said buschbaum 's former coach herbert czingon .
" but he can get up and is upbeat that he can leave for home on the weekend . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buschbaum stays fit and helps other pole vaulters train in mainz a year has passed since buschbaum revealed that she felt like a man trapped in a women 's body and would undergo the gender change to find her personal freedom .
she appeared in television talk shows and also won respect in the athletics scene for her courage .
but the medical implications of the gender change - the use of doping substances - required buschbaum to quit pole vaulting , with european championship bronze medals from 1998 and 2002 the best results for the athlete with a personal best of 4.70 meters .
shortly-cropped hair always made buschbaum look boyish , but now facial hair and muscles are growing , and the voice is deeper .
buschbaum also has a new id card as balian buschbaum .
starting a new life " some friends wished me happy birthday , " she said in her diary shortly before christmas 2007 as the treatment started .
" as if the first testosterone shot was my second birthday .
it was the start of a new life . "
things have gone well even though buschbaum is at time a little unnerved by the wait for further treatment .
the use of testosterone has also given him a unique outlook at the doping issue because , as he says , he is living these changes through the use of banned steroids . buschbaum is keeping fit by training for an upcoming new role as pole vault coach at the usc mainz club in central germany .

23 , of a " difficult decision . "
he said former germany defender markus babbel was now in charge and would hopefully " bring the team back on to the road of success . " babbel was an assistant coach in stuttgart after ending his career as a player there in 2007 .
he is now team manager while the daily training is to be conducted by rainer widmaier . veh , 47 , replaced giovanni trapattoni at stuttgart in february 2006 and led them to a surprise bundesliga title in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have n't always impressed since winning the league in 2007 stuttgart finished sixth last season but are now suffering through a poor campaign .
the team has slumped to 11th place with a winless run of four games and just one victory in the last seven league matches . " it was a difficult decision for all they -lrb- veh and assistant alfons higl -rrb- achieved over the past three years , " said staudt . veh admitted on thursday that he was to blame as well along with other club officials for not having brought the right new players to the club after the 2007 title . " i ca n't lash out at the team because i made mistakes as well , " he said . but veh had urged his team around germany players mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger to reverse the negative trend in wolfsburg instead of going down 4-1 at the team of felix magath , himself a former stuttgart coach . major matches ahead the task to motivate the players now lies with babbel who has little time as stuttgart have a uefa cup date at italian club sampdoria on thursday and host schalke 04 in the bundesliga on sunday . " i talked to the team this morning and told the players that they must live up to their potential , " said staudt " the separation from armin veh is no alibi for the players . " veh was the second german top flight coach to get his marching orders this season , following jos luhukay at borussia moenchengladbach . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.11.2008 ford germany ceo : we 're not calling for government aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes does n't believe that helping individual carmakers is the way to go the head of ford germany , bernhard mattes , told dw-tv why he 's rejecting a government bailout for his struggling industry , but still supports a concerted european effort to help carmakers get back on their feet . dw-tv : mr. mattes , you 're the boss of more than 24,000 workers building cars for ford here in germany .
recently your turnover has dropped dramatically , why is that ? bernhard mattes : the financial crisis around the world and here in europe - and the real estate crisis - have unsettled consumers , so they 're buying less .
we do n't just produce cars here for germany , but for other european markets too - that 's forced us to scale back our overall production . how bad is the situation ?
can you still sleep well at night ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller models like the ford fiesta are popular in europe yes , i do sleep well .
you need to regenerate in order to tackle the challenges with renewed vigor .
we have an excellent range of models and a strong european sales structure .
these have allowed us to do relatively well , despite a drop in demand .
we 're the second-strongest car brand in europe and we 've also been able to achieve growth in germany , which is positive , but we 're adapting our production to the overall demand . but in the last few months the picture has changed quite a bit , has n't it ? absolutely .
you can divide the year into two halves .
in the first half we had a strong demand and good sales , and in the second half it has dropped significantly , all over europe , also in markets like spain , italy , france and , of course , germany . would you describe the slump as dramatic ? well , it has taken on quite sizeable dimensions .
if you consider that demand in europe was at 18 million cars and now we 're at about 16 million or perhaps only 15 million this year , then that 's quite a significant drop .
and it calls for flexibility . what does being flexible mean for ford germany ?
you ca n't just lay off workers , it 's not that easy , what are your plans ? we had the advantage that our production was working to capacity , sometimes even more than 100 percent .
so we were able to bring production down to normal levels first and then we also reduced capacity by not renewing the contracts of 100 temporary workers for example .
in our engine plant here in cologne , we also reduced working hours . your parent company in the us is in serious trouble .
to what extent will that affect ford germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have little interest in us-style gas-guzzlers the only direct way we 'll feel it is in our plant here where we build the engines for large us vehicles : we 've had to reduce working hours .
but otherwise our model range is primarily aimed at european markets and so we wo n't feel any effect .
on the contrary , we have developed a plan for the entire ford motor company : to develop cars jointly and manufacture and sell globally .
we will implement this with our parent company and with our colleagues in asia . but what happens if your parent company suddenly ca n't pay its bills anymore ? we have cash reserves of about $ 30 billion -lrb- 24 billion euros -rrb- for the entire concern .
and that 's enough for us to implement our plan to restructure the company and at the same time develop new , fuel efficient cars .
and so we 're not thinking in terms of the kind of scenario you just described . does this means that ford wo n't be asking for state aid then ? that is the reason that we 've said we 're not calling for government aid or guarantees .
we are in a situation where our reserves are adequate for developing our products and implementing our plans . how long will those reserves last ?
is there an end in sight ? we are confident that the economy will slowly start to recover in the second half of 2009 or , at the latest , in 2010 .
by then we 'll be that much stronger worldwide with our products so we 'll be able to react to the market .
so that 's not really a concern for us . all that sounds quite optimistic and relaxed .
so why are all these crisis scenarios for the car industry being tossed around , for instance that the european car industry will need 40 billion euros of support ? well , of course we 're not that relaxed .
we 're looking intensely at our costs .
we 're looking intensely at our productivity and efficiency and we 're looking for ways to further reduce our costs , to stay competitive and to be able to grow profitably .
that 's the one thing .
the other is the competitiveness of the european auto industry .
and here european car makers have proposed a 40-billion-euro package from the european investment bank to provide financial means , payable back with interest , to develop new technologies that ensure european carmakers maintain and expand their ability to compete . but if you 're profitable , why should the state provide money ?
would n't that suspend the rules of the marketplace ? what we 're seeing now is that financing , the availability of financing on world credit markets , has been restricted .
we want to develop efficient vehicles and new technologies as fast as possible , and that 's why we 're asking the european investment bank to make this financing available , as loans - interest-earning loans - so that we can develop progressive technologies , thereby improving our ability to compete . the auto industry is one sector , but there are other sectors too that want government aid .
how can a domino effect be prevented ?
or can it be prevented at all ? first of all there is of course this protective program that the german government has set up .
it 's an outstanding device for financing all sectors , to make resources available .
but this package was not set up just to prop up the finance sector .
it was set up to make loans available so that companies have the ability to make necessary investments and implement research and development projects .
so here is a significant amount of money available , and guarantees , which can be used to do these things and i think it would be quite helpful to accelerate this . your direct competitor , opel , has already applied for state guarantees , and said they are necessary .
would n't that give a company like opel a competitive advantage over other auto makers ?
do these kinds of solo bailouts make sense ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is hoping to get government help well , i 'm sure the european commission will take a very close look at what bailouts for individual companies mean from a competition point of view , and that 's true not just in our industry .
we think that a coordinated action , like the one european makers have proposed , with the european investment bank , is the right answer . so no solo bailouts ? from the point of view of competition , i 'd say a coordinated effort is better than going it alone . how often do you talk with politicians these days ?
are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .
our exchange of information is transparent and we discuss what measures are appropriate and necessary , for instance , to revive demand and growth . that means , if you walk out of here and call chancellor merkel 's office , you 'd be put right through ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mattes has the chancellor 's ear you could see it that way .
right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .
so there is a dialogue with various ministries , and with various state premiers , like here in north rhine-westphalia . interview : manuela kasper-claridge -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are there intensive contacts between automakers and political leaders ? of course .
politicians want to know what 's going on , and i think that 's very welcome , that the german government as well as the european commission are very closely monitoring the well-being of the automobile industry , which is a core industry in europe and in germany .

right now , she has my proposal on her desk - suggesting how a vehicle tax waiver or reduction might be made more effective - or better for the environment - than the proposal that the government has adopted .

23 , of a " difficult decision . "
he said former germany defender markus babbel was now in charge and would hopefully " bring the team back on to the road of success . " babbel was an assistant coach in stuttgart after ending his career as a player there in 2007 .
he is now team manager while the daily training is to be conducted by rainer widmaier . veh , 47 , replaced giovanni trapattoni at stuttgart in february 2006 and led them to a surprise bundesliga title in 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart have n't always impressed since winning the league in 2007 stuttgart finished sixth last season but are now suffering through a poor campaign .
the team has slumped to 11th place with a winless run of four games and just one victory in the last seven league matches . " it was a difficult decision for all they -lrb- veh and assistant alfons higl -rrb- achieved over the past three years , " said staudt . veh admitted on thursday that he was to blame as well along with other club officials for not having brought the right new players to the club after the 2007 title . " i ca n't lash out at the team because i made mistakes as well , " he said . but veh had urged his team around germany players mario gomez and thomas hitzlsperger to reverse the negative trend in wolfsburg instead of going down 4-1 at the team of felix magath , himself a former stuttgart coach . major matches ahead the task to motivate the players now lies with babbel who has little time as stuttgart have a uefa cup date at italian club sampdoria on thursday and host schalke 04 in the bundesliga on sunday . " i talked to the team this morning and told the players that they must live up to their potential , " said staudt " the separation from armin veh is no alibi for the players .

but the monumental steel and concrete structure planned as a nazi-era holiday complex has survived otherwise unscathed .
the gigantic building in the baltic sea resort of prora on the island of ruegen was part of hitler 's so-called " strength through joy " program to keep germans fit and healthy .
never used by vacationers it was to house 20,000 vacationers in 8,000 rooms as part of the nazi program to make soldiers fit for war and workers strong for production .
no holiday-makers ever stayed at prora .
work on the complex , which began in 1936 , slowed in 1939 with the outbreak of war when germany attacked poland and was finally halted in 1943 .
the only germans to live in the half-built resort were refugees from bombed-out cities and those fleeing the invading soviet red army .
after the end of the war , the communist east german military used one of the five 550-meter -lrb- 1,800-foot -rrb- blocks as a convalescence home .
the sweeping six-storey concrete complex is situated on one of ruegen 's most beautiful beaches and was closed to the public with barbed wire and guards armed with sub-machine guns .
following german reunification in 1990 it was taken over by the federal government .
saddled with this unwelcome legacy , officials had been scratching their heads for years over what to do with prora .
decision after years of uncertainty bildunterschrift : visitors have a view of the ocean from nearly anywhere in the complex now , 18 years after unification , a major reconstruction project is about to be launched to turn the site into a huge holiday complex .
the makeover was made possible after private investors and the local government in ruegen purchased four of the blocks , which were under a historical preservation order .
horst schaumann , mayor of the nearby town of binz , said that " after years of uncertainty we expect the construction cranes to start turning in the first half of 2009 . "
the local government is next month expected to approve 14.5 million euros -lrb- $ 18.4 million -rrb- to turn one of the blocks into a youth hostel , providing accommodation for 500 people by 2011 .
a group of investors plans to spend 80 million euros to turn two of the other blocks into hotels , complete with pool area and 150 private apartments .
work here is also expected to begin next year .
the fourth block is to be made into a youth sports facility , event center and hotel complex for holidaymakers at a cost of 50 million euros .
if all goes according to plan , the entire area will provide rooms for 3,000 visitors .
critics say state not taking responsibility some historians have criticized the plans , accusing the government of shirking its historical responsibility by selling the property to private investors .
juergen rostock , chairman of the foundation new culture , says it is " scandalous " to host party-like events at what is essentially a site of remembrance .
" holding parties there is what the ' strength through joy ' program envisaged , " he said .

a number of minor roads were closed in moray and aberdeenshire , particularly around the ski areas .
the met office warned that further snow falls were expected over much of scotland over the weekend , with as much as 10cm likely to fall in some areas .

about 5cm of snow fell in aberdeen on friday night , and the met office has issued severe weather advisories of heavy snowfalls across most of the country over the weekend .
it also warned motorists that roads across scotland were likely to be icy overnight between saturday and sunday .
the freezing conditions were expected to continue to move down the east coast of the uk , with snow showers gradually turning to rain on sunday morning and any lying snow beginning to thaw as temperatures rise .
patrol vehicles motoring organisation the aa advised motorists to only drive as fast as conditions allow and to be aware of the greater stopping distances required in ice and snow .
it said it was deploying snow-busting patrol vehicles to help rescue drivers stranded in ice and snow .
the land rovers , equipped with winches , tow poles and 4x4 capability , are being deployed in northern areas which are likely to bear the main brunt of the cold weather .
bookmakers william hill reported record betting levels on a white christmas , and have cuts the odds on snow falling on christmas day in london from 8/1 to 6/1 and glasgow is now as short as 7/2 .
william hill spokesman rupert adams said : " we have never had so much money in the book with over a month to go .
