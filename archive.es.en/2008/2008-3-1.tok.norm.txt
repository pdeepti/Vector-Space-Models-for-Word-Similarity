it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction . a five-point proposal released friday , feb .
29 , in berlin called for 10 percent of public jobs to go to migrants as well as the introduction of turkish lessons and a course called " intercultural life " in schools . the aim was for turks to enjoy the same rights and participation as others in society , said kenan kolat , chairman of the association of turkish communities in germany . kolat also said that immigrants to germany should receive the right to vote in municipal elections and retain their original citizenship if they decide to become naturalized in germany .
germany currently does not recognize dual-citizenship . turks make up the largest minority in germany .
statistics from 2006 show 1.7 million residents of germany are turkish nationals .
including those acquiring german nationality by birth or naturalization , the turkish community totals 2.4 million in a population of 82 million . fires leave turkish community concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish community is anxious after a series of fires kolat said a recent spate of 17 fires in 24 days in housing complexes used by turks , including one arson attack , had caused a great deal of unrest among the turkish community .
only in a few cases were the fires racially motivated , he said , but nonetheless turks were living in fear and needed germans ' solidarity . " in many cases these are not attacks , but because the fires occurred in a series , a discussion naturally started in the turkish population , " he said .
" and we have the fear that these fires could incite others - including far-right radicals - to other attacks . " his comments came nearly four weeks after a blaze in the south-western city of ludwigshafen claimed the lives of nine turkish immigrants . though the case of the fire remains unclear , initial reports that the blaze was started deliberately were shown by investigators on thursday to be inaccurate . kenan said his organization would cooperate with germany 's trade unions in drafting a code of ethics that would require politicians to refrain from creating an anti-migrant sentiment . earlier this year , the state premier in hesse , roland koch , caused outrage by highlighting crime committed by young foreigners when campaigning for re-election . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it includes renowned museums such as the pergamon museum , with its vast collection of classical and middle eastern antiquities , and the new national gallery , which specializes in modern european and american art . born in munich is 1959 , parzinger was previously the head of the german archaeological institute , which he expanded and modernized .
in an ap interview , parzinger admitted it would be difficult to have less time to dedicate to his passion of archeology , but described his new task as " amazing " and said he was " greatly looking forward to it . " renowned archeologist the prehistorian speaks 10 languages , including turkish , farsi , russian , spanish and greek , and has taken part in numerous archeological digs in countries , more recently in russia and kazakhstan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parzinger has specialized in the scythian culture , which was the focus of a major exhibition in berlin last year for more than a decade , he has intensively researched the scythians , a nation of horse-riding nomads originally of iranian stock .

lehmann will begin his new job as head of germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , on april 1 . he has also said his main tasks will be to create a better network between the different institutions within the foundation , as well as to strengthen the research aspects . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.03.2008 merkel 's challenger under pressure over risky left shift großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck has raised many eyebrows by reversing his position on the left party german politicians and public opinion polls are increasing the pressure on kurt beck , leader of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , over his decision to approve cooperation with a far-left party . the shape of a new government coalition in the state of hesse still remains unclear after stunning losses robbed angela merkel 's conservatives of their clear majority and the far left saw surprise gains in the state elections on jan .
27 .
but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .
beck 's fading fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to win a second term as germany 's chancellor next year the spd , which is in an uneasy federal coalition government with the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is expected to decide early next year about a candidate who will challenge the highly popular merkel in the forthcoming federal elections .
a poll for broadcaster zdf on friday showed only 27 percent of voters believe beck should be the spd 's candidate down from with 40 percent in november .
even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .
a separate poll by forsa this week showed support for the spd down 1 percentage point and merkel 's conservatives up .
the most likely alternative to beck would be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , will see northrup grumman replace 179 of the air force 's tanker aircraft , and could potentially lead to a deal to replace all of the force 's 600 tankers at a value of up to $ 100 billion .
in paris , eads ceo louis gallois described the deal as a " fabulous victory . "
" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .
the award comes as a heavy blow to the us aviation giant , which has long had an edge over its competitors in procuring military contracts .
bloomberg news reported that an analyst survey had unanimously picked boeing to win the contract .
25,000 jobs in alabama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo louis gallois is happy about winning a us defense contract northrup grumman 's proposed kc-45a tanker is based on the airframe of the airbus a330 commercial aircraft .
airbus is a subsidiary of the european aeronotic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .
" we are creating lots of jobs in the united states but we are also creating them in europe , " gallois said .
the air force 's current fleet of kc-135 refueling aircraft were built by boeing in the 1950s and 1960s .
" the kc-45a is the tanker of the future , " the commander of air mobility command , general arthur j. lichte , said in a statement .

27 .
but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .

a poll for broadcaster zdf on friday showed only 27 percent of voters believe beck should be the spd 's candidate down from with 40 percent in november .
even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .

but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction . a five-point proposal released friday , feb .

germany currently does not recognize dual-citizenship . turks make up the largest minority in germany .
statistics from 2006 show 1.7 million residents of germany are turkish nationals .

only in a few cases were the fires racially motivated , he said , but nonetheless turks were living in fear and needed germans ' solidarity . " in many cases these are not attacks , but because the fires occurred in a series , a discussion naturally started in the turkish population , " he said .
" and we have the fear that these fires could incite others - including far-right radicals - to other attacks . " his comments came nearly four weeks after a blaze in the south-western city of ludwigshafen claimed the lives of nine turkish immigrants . though the case of the fire remains unclear , initial reports that the blaze was started deliberately were shown by investigators on thursday to be inaccurate . kenan said his organization would cooperate with germany 's trade unions in drafting a code of ethics that would require politicians to refrain from creating an anti-migrant sentiment . earlier this year , the state premier in hesse , roland koch , caused outrage by highlighting crime committed by young foreigners when campaigning for re-election . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction . a five-point proposal released friday , feb .
29 , in berlin called for 10 percent of public jobs to go to migrants as well as the introduction of turkish lessons and a course called " intercultural life " in schools . the aim was for turks to enjoy the same rights and participation as others in society , said kenan kolat , chairman of the association of turkish communities in germany . kolat also said that immigrants to germany should receive the right to vote in municipal elections and retain their original citizenship if they decide to become naturalized in germany .
germany currently does not recognize dual-citizenship . turks make up the largest minority in germany .
statistics from 2006 show 1.7 million residents of germany are turkish nationals .
including those acquiring german nationality by birth or naturalization , the turkish community totals 2.4 million in a population of 82 million . fires leave turkish community concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish community is anxious after a series of fires kolat said a recent spate of 17 fires in 24 days in housing complexes used by turks , including one arson attack , had caused a great deal of unrest among the turkish community .
only in a few cases were the fires racially motivated , he said , but nonetheless turks were living in fear and needed germans ' solidarity . " in many cases these are not attacks , but because the fires occurred in a series , a discussion naturally started in the turkish population , " he said .
" and we have the fear that these fires could incite others - including far-right radicals - to other attacks . " his comments came nearly four weeks after a blaze in the south-western city of ludwigshafen claimed the lives of nine turkish immigrants . though the case of the fire remains unclear , initial reports that the blaze was started deliberately were shown by investigators on thursday to be inaccurate . kenan said his organization would cooperate with germany 's trade unions in drafting a code of ethics that would require politicians to refrain from creating an anti-migrant sentiment . earlier this year , the state premier in hesse , roland koch , caused outrage by highlighting crime committed by young foreigners when campaigning for re-election . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , will see northrup grumman replace 179 of the air force 's tanker aircraft , and could potentially lead to a deal to replace all of the force 's 600 tankers at a value of up to $ 100 billion .
in paris , eads ceo louis gallois described the deal as a " fabulous victory . "
" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .
the award comes as a heavy blow to the us aviation giant , which has long had an edge over its competitors in procuring military contracts .
bloomberg news reported that an analyst survey had unanimously picked boeing to win the contract .
25,000 jobs in alabama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo louis gallois is happy about winning a us defense contract northrup grumman 's proposed kc-45a tanker is based on the airframe of the airbus a330 commercial aircraft .
airbus is a subsidiary of the european aeronotic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .
" we are creating lots of jobs in the united states but we are also creating them in europe , " gallois said .
the air force 's current fleet of kc-135 refueling aircraft were built by boeing in the 1950s and 1960s .
" the kc-45a is the tanker of the future , " the commander of air mobility command , general arthur j. lichte , said in a statement .
" it will enable us to carry more fuel cargo and allow us the flexibility to refuel any type of receiver on every mission . "
secretary of the air force michael w wynne said the northrop grumman award provided better value to the us taxpayer .
angry reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads will build a factory in alabama some us lawmakers reacted angrily to the deal which is widely seen as a major coup for europe 's aviation industry .
republican senator sam brownback said he was " shocked at this decision and very disappointed . "
" i 'll be calling upon the secretary of defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by boeing , " brownback added .
" it 's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to europe instead of building them in america . "
republican representative todd tiahrt said he was " deeply troubled . "
he added : " we should have an american tanker built by an american company with american workers , " he said .

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction . a five-point proposal released friday , feb .
29 , in berlin called for 10 percent of public jobs to go to migrants as well as the introduction of turkish lessons and a course called " intercultural life " in schools . the aim was for turks to enjoy the same rights and participation as others in society , said kenan kolat , chairman of the association of turkish communities in germany . kolat also said that immigrants to germany should receive the right to vote in municipal elections and retain their original citizenship if they decide to become naturalized in germany .
germany currently does not recognize dual-citizenship . turks make up the largest minority in germany .
statistics from 2006 show 1.7 million residents of germany are turkish nationals .
including those acquiring german nationality by birth or naturalization , the turkish community totals 2.4 million in a population of 82 million . fires leave turkish community concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish community is anxious after a series of fires kolat said a recent spate of 17 fires in 24 days in housing complexes used by turks , including one arson attack , had caused a great deal of unrest among the turkish community .
only in a few cases were the fires racially motivated , he said , but nonetheless turks were living in fear and needed germans ' solidarity . " in many cases these are not attacks , but because the fires occurred in a series , a discussion naturally started in the turkish population , " he said .
" and we have the fear that these fires could incite others - including far-right radicals - to other attacks . " his comments came nearly four weeks after a blaze in the south-western city of ludwigshafen claimed the lives of nine turkish immigrants . though the case of the fire remains unclear , initial reports that the blaze was started deliberately were shown by investigators on thursday to be inaccurate . kenan said his organization would cooperate with germany 's trade unions in drafting a code of ethics that would require politicians to refrain from creating an anti-migrant sentiment . earlier this year , the state premier in hesse , roland koch , caused outrage by highlighting crime committed by young foreigners when campaigning for re-election . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .

in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .

"
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction . a five-point proposal released friday , feb .
29 , in berlin called for 10 percent of public jobs to go to migrants as well as the introduction of turkish lessons and a course called " intercultural life " in schools . the aim was for turks to enjoy the same rights and participation as others in society , said kenan kolat , chairman of the association of turkish communities in germany . kolat also said that immigrants to germany should receive the right to vote in municipal elections and retain their original citizenship if they decide to become naturalized in germany .
germany currently does not recognize dual-citizenship . turks make up the largest minority in germany .
statistics from 2006 show 1.7 million residents of germany are turkish nationals .
including those acquiring german nationality by birth or naturalization , the turkish community totals 2.4 million in a population of 82 million . fires leave turkish community concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish community is anxious after a series of fires kolat said a recent spate of 17 fires in 24 days in housing complexes used by turks , including one arson attack , had caused a great deal of unrest among the turkish community .
only in a few cases were the fires racially motivated , he said , but nonetheless turks were living in fear and needed germans ' solidarity . " in many cases these are not attacks , but because the fires occurred in a series , a discussion naturally started in the turkish population , " he said .
" and we have the fear that these fires could incite others - including far-right radicals - to other attacks . " his comments came nearly four weeks after a blaze in the south-western city of ludwigshafen claimed the lives of nine turkish immigrants . though the case of the fire remains unclear , initial reports that the blaze was started deliberately were shown by investigators on thursday to be inaccurate . kenan said his organization would cooperate with germany 's trade unions in drafting a code of ethics that would require politicians to refrain from creating an anti-migrant sentiment . earlier this year , the state premier in hesse , roland koch , caused outrage by highlighting crime committed by young foreigners when campaigning for re-election . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , will see northrup grumman replace 179 of the air force 's tanker aircraft , and could potentially lead to a deal to replace all of the force 's 600 tankers at a value of up to $ 100 billion .
in paris , eads ceo louis gallois described the deal as a " fabulous victory . "
" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .
the award comes as a heavy blow to the us aviation giant , which has long had an edge over its competitors in procuring military contracts .
bloomberg news reported that an analyst survey had unanimously picked boeing to win the contract .
25,000 jobs in alabama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo louis gallois is happy about winning a us defense contract northrup grumman 's proposed kc-45a tanker is based on the airframe of the airbus a330 commercial aircraft .
airbus is a subsidiary of the european aeronotic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .
" we are creating lots of jobs in the united states but we are also creating them in europe , " gallois said .
the air force 's current fleet of kc-135 refueling aircraft were built by boeing in the 1950s and 1960s .
" the kc-45a is the tanker of the future , " the commander of air mobility command , general arthur j. lichte , said in a statement .
" it will enable us to carry more fuel cargo and allow us the flexibility to refuel any type of receiver on every mission . "
secretary of the air force michael w wynne said the northrop grumman award provided better value to the us taxpayer .
angry reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads will build a factory in alabama some us lawmakers reacted angrily to the deal which is widely seen as a major coup for europe 's aviation industry .
republican senator sam brownback said he was " shocked at this decision and very disappointed . "
" i 'll be calling upon the secretary of defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by boeing , " brownback added .
" it 's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to europe instead of building them in america . "
republican representative todd tiahrt said he was " deeply troubled . "

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election .

with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue .

" russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer .

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction . a five-point proposal released friday , feb .
29 , in berlin called for 10 percent of public jobs to go to migrants as well as the introduction of turkish lessons and a course called " intercultural life " in schools . the aim was for turks to enjoy the same rights and participation as others in society , said kenan kolat , chairman of the association of turkish communities in germany . kolat also said that immigrants to germany should receive the right to vote in municipal elections and retain their original citizenship if they decide to become naturalized in germany .
germany currently does not recognize dual-citizenship . turks make up the largest minority in germany .
statistics from 2006 show 1.7 million residents of germany are turkish nationals .
including those acquiring german nationality by birth or naturalization , the turkish community totals 2.4 million in a population of 82 million . fires leave turkish community concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish community is anxious after a series of fires kolat said a recent spate of 17 fires in 24 days in housing complexes used by turks , including one arson attack , had caused a great deal of unrest among the turkish community .
only in a few cases were the fires racially motivated , he said , but nonetheless turks were living in fear and needed germans ' solidarity . " in many cases these are not attacks , but because the fires occurred in a series , a discussion naturally started in the turkish population , " he said .
" and we have the fear that these fires could incite others - including far-right radicals - to other attacks . " his comments came nearly four weeks after a blaze in the south-western city of ludwigshafen claimed the lives of nine turkish immigrants . though the case of the fire remains unclear , initial reports that the blaze was started deliberately were shown by investigators on thursday to be inaccurate . kenan said his organization would cooperate with germany 's trade unions in drafting a code of ethics that would require politicians to refrain from creating an anti-migrant sentiment . earlier this year , the state premier in hesse , roland koch , caused outrage by highlighting crime committed by young foreigners when campaigning for re-election . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .

"
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .

even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .

29 , will see northrup grumman replace 179 of the air force 's tanker aircraft , and could potentially lead to a deal to replace all of the force 's 600 tankers at a value of up to $ 100 billion .
in paris , eads ceo louis gallois described the deal as a " fabulous victory . "
" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .
the award comes as a heavy blow to the us aviation giant , which has long had an edge over its competitors in procuring military contracts .
bloomberg news reported that an analyst survey had unanimously picked boeing to win the contract .
25,000 jobs in alabama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo louis gallois is happy about winning a us defense contract northrup grumman 's proposed kc-45a tanker is based on the airframe of the airbus a330 commercial aircraft .
airbus is a subsidiary of the european aeronotic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .
" we are creating lots of jobs in the united states but we are also creating them in europe , " gallois said .
the air force 's current fleet of kc-135 refueling aircraft were built by boeing in the 1950s and 1960s .
" the kc-45a is the tanker of the future , " the commander of air mobility command , general arthur j. lichte , said in a statement .
" it will enable us to carry more fuel cargo and allow us the flexibility to refuel any type of receiver on every mission . "
secretary of the air force michael w wynne said the northrop grumman award provided better value to the us taxpayer .
angry reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads will build a factory in alabama some us lawmakers reacted angrily to the deal which is widely seen as a major coup for europe 's aviation industry .
republican senator sam brownback said he was " shocked at this decision and very disappointed . "
" i 'll be calling upon the secretary of defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by boeing , " brownback added .
" it 's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to europe instead of building them in america . "
republican representative todd tiahrt said he was " deeply troubled . "
he added : " we should have an american tanker built by an american company with american workers , " he said .
" i can not believe we would create french jobs in place of kansas jobs . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it suggested a job quota as a step in the right direction . a five-point proposal released friday , feb .
29 , in berlin called for 10 percent of public jobs to go to migrants as well as the introduction of turkish lessons and a course called " intercultural life " in schools . the aim was for turks to enjoy the same rights and participation as others in society , said kenan kolat , chairman of the association of turkish communities in germany . kolat also said that immigrants to germany should receive the right to vote in municipal elections and retain their original citizenship if they decide to become naturalized in germany .
germany currently does not recognize dual-citizenship . turks make up the largest minority in germany .
statistics from 2006 show 1.7 million residents of germany are turkish nationals .
including those acquiring german nationality by birth or naturalization , the turkish community totals 2.4 million in a population of 82 million . fires leave turkish community concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish community is anxious after a series of fires kolat said a recent spate of 17 fires in 24 days in housing complexes used by turks , including one arson attack , had caused a great deal of unrest among the turkish community .
only in a few cases were the fires racially motivated , he said , but nonetheless turks were living in fear and needed germans ' solidarity . " in many cases these are not attacks , but because the fires occurred in a series , a discussion naturally started in the turkish population , " he said .
" and we have the fear that these fires could incite others - including far-right radicals - to other attacks . " his comments came nearly four weeks after a blaze in the south-western city of ludwigshafen claimed the lives of nine turkish immigrants . though the case of the fire remains unclear , initial reports that the blaze was started deliberately were shown by investigators on thursday to be inaccurate . kenan said his organization would cooperate with germany 's trade unions in drafting a code of ethics that would require politicians to refrain from creating an anti-migrant sentiment . earlier this year , the state premier in hesse , roland koch , caused outrage by highlighting crime committed by young foreigners when campaigning for re-election . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .

" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .

27 .
but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .
beck 's fading fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to win a second term as germany 's chancellor next year the spd , which is in an uneasy federal coalition government with the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is expected to decide early next year about a candidate who will challenge the highly popular merkel in the forthcoming federal elections .
a poll for broadcaster zdf on friday showed only 27 percent of voters believe beck should be the spd 's candidate down from with 40 percent in november .
even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .

with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue .

currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer .

27 .
but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .
beck 's fading fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to win a second term as germany 's chancellor next year the spd , which is in an uneasy federal coalition government with the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is expected to decide early next year about a candidate who will challenge the highly popular merkel in the forthcoming federal elections .
a poll for broadcaster zdf on friday showed only 27 percent of voters believe beck should be the spd 's candidate down from with 40 percent in november .
even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .

in paris , eads ceo louis gallois described the deal as a " fabulous victory . "
" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .
the award comes as a heavy blow to the us aviation giant , which has long had an edge over its competitors in procuring military contracts .
bloomberg news reported that an analyst survey had unanimously picked boeing to win the contract .

northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .

29 , will see northrup grumman replace 179 of the air force 's tanker aircraft , and could potentially lead to a deal to replace all of the force 's 600 tankers at a value of up to $ 100 billion .
in paris , eads ceo louis gallois described the deal as a " fabulous victory . "
" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .
the award comes as a heavy blow to the us aviation giant , which has long had an edge over its competitors in procuring military contracts .
bloomberg news reported that an analyst survey had unanimously picked boeing to win the contract .
25,000 jobs in alabama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo louis gallois is happy about winning a us defense contract northrup grumman 's proposed kc-45a tanker is based on the airframe of the airbus a330 commercial aircraft .
airbus is a subsidiary of the european aeronotic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .
" we are creating lots of jobs in the united states but we are also creating them in europe , " gallois said .
the air force 's current fleet of kc-135 refueling aircraft were built by boeing in the 1950s and 1960s .
" the kc-45a is the tanker of the future , " the commander of air mobility command , general arthur j. lichte , said in a statement .
" it will enable us to carry more fuel cargo and allow us the flexibility to refuel any type of receiver on every mission . "
secretary of the air force michael w wynne said the northrop grumman award provided better value to the us taxpayer .
angry reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads will build a factory in alabama some us lawmakers reacted angrily to the deal which is widely seen as a major coup for europe 's aviation industry .
republican senator sam brownback said he was " shocked at this decision and very disappointed . "
" i 'll be calling upon the secretary of defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by boeing , " brownback added .
" it 's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to europe instead of building them in america . "
republican representative todd tiahrt said he was " deeply troubled . "
he added : " we should have an american tanker built by an american company with american workers , " he said .

it includes renowned museums such as the pergamon museum , with its vast collection of classical and middle eastern antiquities , and the new national gallery , which specializes in modern european and american art . born in munich is 1959 , parzinger was previously the head of the german archaeological institute , which he expanded and modernized .
in an ap interview , parzinger admitted it would be difficult to have less time to dedicate to his passion of archeology , but described his new task as " amazing " and said he was " greatly looking forward to it . " renowned archeologist the prehistorian speaks 10 languages , including turkish , farsi , russian , spanish and greek , and has taken part in numerous archeological digs in countries , more recently in russia and kazakhstan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parzinger has specialized in the scythian culture , which was the focus of a major exhibition in berlin last year for more than a decade , he has intensively researched the scythians , a nation of horse-riding nomads originally of iranian stock .

lehmann will begin his new job as head of germany 's cultural institute , the goethe institute , on april 1 . he has also said his main tasks will be to create a better network between the different institutions within the foundation , as well as to strengthen the research aspects . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 .
but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .
beck 's fading fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to win a second term as germany 's chancellor next year the spd , which is in an uneasy federal coalition government with the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is expected to decide early next year about a candidate who will challenge the highly popular merkel in the forthcoming federal elections .
a poll for broadcaster zdf on friday showed only 27 percent of voters believe beck should be the spd 's candidate down from with 40 percent in november .
even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 .

he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue .

" russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer .

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue .

27 .
but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .

with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue .

currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , will see northrup grumman replace 179 of the air force 's tanker aircraft , and could potentially lead to a deal to replace all of the force 's 600 tankers at a value of up to $ 100 billion .
in paris , eads ceo louis gallois described the deal as a " fabulous victory . "
" we are very proud to have won a victory on the american market over boeing , " gallois told france info radio on saturday .
the award comes as a heavy blow to the us aviation giant , which has long had an edge over its competitors in procuring military contracts .
bloomberg news reported that an analyst survey had unanimously picked boeing to win the contract .

northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .
" we are creating lots of jobs in the united states but we are also creating them in europe , " gallois said .
the air force 's current fleet of kc-135 refueling aircraft were built by boeing in the 1950s and 1960s .
" the kc-45a is the tanker of the future , " the commander of air mobility command , general arthur j. lichte , said in a statement .
" it will enable us to carry more fuel cargo and allow us the flexibility to refuel any type of receiver on every mission . "
secretary of the air force michael w wynne said the northrop grumman award provided better value to the us taxpayer .

republican senator sam brownback said he was " shocked at this decision and very disappointed . "
" i 'll be calling upon the secretary of defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by boeing , " brownback added .
" it 's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to europe instead of building them in america . "
republican representative todd tiahrt said he was " deeply troubled . "
he added : " we should have an american tanker built by an american company with american workers , " he said .

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .

with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue .

but some german experts believe that putin 's self-chosen successor will not simply act as a marionette . russians voted on sunday , march 2 , in presidential elections seen by critics as a kremlin-orchestrated plan to divide power between president vladimir putin and his favored successor , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev . with 70 percent of russians telling pollsters they intend to vote for medvedev , no one will be surprised when putin 's self-chosen successor , wins the presidential election . " i 'm in a good mood , " medvedev said as he cast his ballot in moscow , where rain and wet snow sprinkled the streets .
" spring is here .
the season has changed . " the extremely popular president has positioned himself behind his 42-year-old protege , granting medvedev the government 's full backing and appearing with him on campaign posters . improved ties ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could medvedev represent a new era of russian politics ?
with the two russians casting a united front before the election at home , politicians in the europe are wondering if the change in the kremlin will lead to improved ties with moscow . lacking putin 's fierce countenance and sharp tongue , medvedev has been ironically called a " putin-lite . "
but , " despite his gentle , quiet personality , he 's made of steel , " said russian nato delegate dmitry rogosin , as reported by the afp news agency . that might be bad news for european leaders as russian-european relations under putin have been less than smooth over his eight years as president . disputes arose over energy supply , particularly when russia cut off gas to ukraine in 2005 , then ties cooled after the unexplained poisoning death of dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 and russia 's refusal to support kosovar independence created tension in un-sponsored negotiations between pristina and belgrade and continues to divide the un security council . a post-communist generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen just how much power putin will hang on to russia expert thomas kunze from the konrad adenauer foundation in berlin said medvedev would demonstrate continuity with his predecessor , but added that medvedev also represents a new era of russian politicians . " he was born in 1965 and belongs to an entirely different generation than all russian leaders before him , " said kunze .
indeed , medvedev was in his mid-20s and at the beginning of his career when the ussr dissolved in 1991 . " medvedev will be an independent and modern president , " added kunze , contradicting speculation in the western media that the former law professor would simply act as a marionette for putin , who said he would serve as prime minister .
" i think -lsb- medvedev -rsb- is much more aligned with europe . " lip service to liberal market values medvedev gained favor abroad when he cast himself as a market liberal at last year 's world economic forum in davos .
he has supported the fight against corruption and said he does n't think state-run firms necessarily function better than private ones - as chairman of energy giant gazprom he was involved in its process of renationalization . he has also said he wants to strengthen investment and protect private property .
those are promises kunze said he thinks can be taken seriously . medvedev 's popularity has benefited from the economic boom experienced under putin - a boom which is likely to continue . " despite certain political differences between russia and the west , the investment climate is better than ever , " reiner hartmann , chairman of the association of european businesses in russia , told the dpa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas : russia and europe are both troubled by their co-dependence both he and kunze said they expected russia to join the world trade organization this year , a significant step toward developing its global economic ties . rich in oil and gas resources , russia recognizes its dependence on western europe as a vital energy market - and the gazprom chairman certainly does as well , especially s the country currently lacks the pipelines necessary to build up new markets elsewhere . europe is also reliant on russian gas , but kunze said both sides are doing their best to mitigate their mutual dependency by building additional pipelines and investing in renewable energies .
currently about 40 percent of european union gas imports come from russia . strong nato ties under the surface as in matters of energy and economics , russia and the west are dependent on each other in security issues as well . " russia is interested in sustainable relations with nato and the eu , just as the west can not do without russia 's support in overcoming common dangers , " wrote nato defense college research director karl-heinz kamp in the march edition of internationale politik . although russia 's opposition to a planned us missile defense system in central europe and its withdrawal from the conventional forces treaty have created tensions in moscow 's relations with western capitals , its cooperation with nato in sensitive areas like military reform and counter-terrorism has been stronger than many think , kamp said . he cited russia 's participation in the nato-led mediterranean counter-terrorism operation " active endeavour " in 2006 as an example of that cooperation .
nevertheless , kamp also said putin 's successor would continue down a strong-willed path , as far as international relations are concerned . " since the leadership in moscow can hardly be expected to act less loudly and self-confidently on the international stage in the near future , nato will have to rationally distinguish between rhetoric and reality , between legitimate russian security interests and political argumentation , " kamp said . putin 's future remains unclear some wonder whether that loud and self-confident voice wo n't be coming from a future prime minister putin .
kunze , however , said he does n't think putin will stay in politics for much longer . " if he had wanted to stay in power he could have changed the constitution to allow for a third presidential term or he could have given more powers to the prime minister " before taking on that role , explained the russia expert . bildunterschrift : peter the great ruled together with half-brother ivan and even had a specially built double throne , but medvedev and putin are likely to take a different approach kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

northrup grumman plans to build the aircraft at a facility in mobile , alabama , which the company in a statement said would employ 25,000 new workers .
an initial contract valued at $ 1.5 billion is for four test tankers .
" we are creating lots of jobs in the united states but we are also creating them in europe , " gallois said .
the air force 's current fleet of kc-135 refueling aircraft were built by boeing in the 1950s and 1960s .
" the kc-45a is the tanker of the future , " the commander of air mobility command , general arthur j. lichte , said in a statement .
" it will enable us to carry more fuel cargo and allow us the flexibility to refuel any type of receiver on every mission . "
secretary of the air force michael w wynne said the northrop grumman award provided better value to the us taxpayer .

republican senator sam brownback said he was " shocked at this decision and very disappointed . "
" i 'll be calling upon the secretary of defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by boeing , " brownback added .
" it 's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to europe instead of building them in america . "
republican representative todd tiahrt said he was " deeply troubled . "

27 .
but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .
beck 's fading fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to win a second term as germany 's chancellor next year the spd , which is in an uneasy federal coalition government with the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is expected to decide early next year about a candidate who will challenge the highly popular merkel in the forthcoming federal elections .
a poll for broadcaster zdf on friday showed only 27 percent of voters believe beck should be the spd 's candidate down from with 40 percent in november .
even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .
a separate poll by forsa this week showed support for the spd down 1 percentage point and merkel 's conservatives up .
the most likely alternative to beck would be foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but beck 's plans to use left party votes to oust longtime hesse premier roland koch , a conservative ally of merkel , and give the social democrats a much needed push heading into the next year 's federal elections have come under attack from different ends of the political spectrum .
in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck - himself a social democrat - said a majority of spd voters rejected the idea of cooperating with the left and said beck 's decision to work with them in the state of hesse was " not the last word " on the matter .
" such a decision must be better communicated and prepared internally , " steinbrueck said in a clear swipe at beck , who did not consult senior party members before changing his stance on the left - a party he had vowed previously never to work with .
steinbrueck made clear he opposed not only active cooperation with the far-left party but also " tolerating " them by using their votes to take power in hesse , as beck envisions .
straining the coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and back even had their own carnival float in duesseldorf last month meanwhile , conservative chancellor angela merkel told the weekly spiegel that the change of attitude shown by her coalition partner kurt beck after the state elections in hesse was " pretty remarkable " and that it meant " a very difficult situation for the spd . "
merkel also voiced her concern about the reliability of the social democrats as political partners in view of their apparent course change .
" the behaviour of the spd and their chairman will certainly be judged by everybody in light of this experience , " merkel said .
the left - a party formed by former east german communists and disaffected spd supporters - is seen by many as being populist and unreliable .
left party leader oskar lafontaine , a former chairman of the spd who left the party in protest at ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder 's labor market reforms and decision to send german troops abroad , has labelled u.s. president george w. bush a " terrorist " and praised venezuelan leader hugo chavez .
beck 's fading fortunes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel hopes to win a second term as germany 's chancellor next year the spd , which is in an uneasy federal coalition government with the conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is expected to decide early next year about a candidate who will challenge the highly popular merkel in the forthcoming federal elections .
a poll for broadcaster zdf on friday showed only 27 percent of voters believe beck should be the spd 's candidate down from with 40 percent in november .
even more damning , only 37 percent of spd supporters now back him , down from 55 percent three months ago , the poll conducted by forschungsgruppe wahlen showed .

culture secretary andy burnham said the number contributing to the current voluntary scheme was " unacceptable " .
only 360 gambling firms out of 3,800 have paid any money this year and if that does not improve , mr burnham said , a compulsory levy could be introduced .
his warning comes as experts say a rising number of women are becoming addicted to gambling .
mr burnham said he expected greater action on the issue of companies putting a percentage of their profits towards support services .
" regulators , legislators , operators and owners all have a duty to act in a socially responsible manner , accepting that , for some , gambling is an addiction , not a leisure pursuit , " he said .
" unless the industry delivers a substantial increase in contributions by the end of this year , and makes contributions in a timely fashion , i will seek the approval for a statutory levy , at a rate to be determined . "
suicidal psychology professor ros corney , of greenwich university , has given her backing to a compulsory levy as she believes there is not enough support for women gamblers .
for the past year , she has been researching what she says is the growing problem of women addicts .
she believes the increase is being partly driven by a growth in bingo websites and internet betting .
i was fed up and this took me away from realism .
i was just in a little world all on my own problem gambler vicky clarke prof corney said she had interviewed one woman who had gambled £ 70,000 and others who had lost their homes .
" -lsb- gambling -rsb- affects their mental health , it affects their self-esteem , " she said .
" many of the women have felt suicidal , they just do n't know where to turn next .
they ca n't stop and they know they are getting themselves deeper and deeper into trouble . "
vicky clarke , from sheffield , lost £ 25,000 in two months .
for her , it was a way of blocking out all the other problems in her life .
she said : " i was fed up and this took me away from realism .
i was just in a little world all on my own .
i wanted to stop but it was as though it was somebody else inside my body that was making me continue with it . "
therapy service the uk 's only residential gambling addiction centre said it had witnessed a rise in the number of women seeking help .
the gordon house association said nearly half of the people who ask for help through its online therapy service are now women .
five years ago , before it set up the online service , only 10 % of people seeking help were women .
a study by the gambling commission last year found there had not been any significant increase in problem gamblers since its previous survey in 1999 .
but there is concern that the true extent of the problem among women is hidden as internet gambling is often a solitary , secretive activity which people may not admit to .
coral gala bingo , which runs a website , said it was one of the largest contributors to the responsibility in gambling trust and it would support a compulsory levy if it proved necessary .

suicidal psychology professor ros corney , of greenwich university , has given her backing to a compulsory levy as she believes there is not enough support for women gamblers .

she believes the increase is being partly driven by a growth in bingo websites and internet betting .

culture secretary andy burnham said the number contributing to the current voluntary scheme was " unacceptable " .
only 360 gambling firms out of 3,800 have paid any money this year and if that does not improve , mr burnham said , a compulsory levy could be introduced .
his warning comes as experts say a rising number of women are becoming addicted to gambling .
mr burnham said he expected greater action on the issue of companies putting a percentage of their profits towards support services .
" regulators , legislators , operators and owners all have a duty to act in a socially responsible manner , accepting that , for some , gambling is an addiction , not a leisure pursuit , " he said .
" unless the industry delivers a substantial increase in contributions by the end of this year , and makes contributions in a timely fashion , i will seek the approval for a statutory levy , at a rate to be determined . "
suicidal psychology professor ros corney , of greenwich university , has given her backing to a compulsory levy as she believes there is not enough support for women gamblers .
for the past year , she has been researching what she says is the growing problem of women addicts .
she believes the increase is being partly driven by a growth in bingo websites and internet betting .
i was fed up and this took me away from realism .
i was just in a little world all on my own problem gambler vicky clarke prof corney said she had interviewed one woman who had gambled £ 70,000 and others who had lost their homes .
" -lsb- gambling -rsb- affects their mental health , it affects their self-esteem , " she said .
" many of the women have felt suicidal , they just do n't know where to turn next .
they ca n't stop and they know they are getting themselves deeper and deeper into trouble . "
vicky clarke , from sheffield , lost £ 25,000 in two months .
for her , it was a way of blocking out all the other problems in her life .
she said : " i was fed up and this took me away from realism .
i was just in a little world all on my own .
i wanted to stop but it was as though it was somebody else inside my body that was making me continue with it . "
therapy service the uk 's only residential gambling addiction centre said it had witnessed a rise in the number of women seeking help .
the gordon house association said nearly half of the people who ask for help through its online therapy service are now women .
five years ago , before it set up the online service , only 10 % of people seeking help were women .
a study by the gambling commission last year found there had not been any significant increase in problem gamblers since its previous survey in 1999 .
but there is concern that the true extent of the problem among women is hidden as internet gambling is often a solitary , secretive activity which people may not admit to .
coral gala bingo , which runs a website , said it was one of the largest contributors to the responsibility in gambling trust and it would support a compulsory levy if it proved necessary .

this year 's parade is the largest ever , with 10,000 participants , including a military contingent , strutting their stuff in colourful costumes .
the event has become one of the largest gay pride festivals in the world and generates millions in tourism revenue .
members of the original 1978 march , which ended in clashes with police and 50 arrests , are being honoured .
about 100 ministers and clergy will offer an apology for the treatment of gays and lesbians .
' still difficult ' the event attracts people from around the world .
air new zealand put on a special " pink flight " from san francisco to sydney .
as usual , the lesbian motorcycle group dykes on bikes began the procession up central sydney 's oxford street , followed by nearly 200 of the original " class of ' 78 " or their partners .
for the first time , an official contingent from the australian defence force is taking part .
while sydney has embraced its gay community , not all of australia has , said one of the 1978 marchers .
" it is still very difficult for young people in country towns to come out as lesbian or gay , and even in outer suburbs and regional centres , " diane minnis told the age newspaper .
the parade includes 150 themed floats , moving dance floors , drag queens and a host of scantily-clad revellers stretching for 4km .
the annual event has become one of the city 's major tourist attractions .
but it is all a far cry from the inaugural fancy-dress gay pride march 30 years ago .
back then male homosexuality was still illegal in new south wales and the march ended with clashes with police and 50 arrests .
now it is arguably the world 's pre-eminent gay and lesbian celebration .

he told delegates in llandudno : " public faith in our political institutions is draining away . "
mr cameron said that " people in wales were fed up with labour " and only the conservatives offered a new agenda .
he said there was a breakdown of public faith in the political system , with a need to end spin , directly engage the public and " mend broken politics " .
mr cameron blamed the behaviour of a minority of politicians of all parties and also behaviour in the commons .
but he also pointed " broken promises " by labour on european referendum and tuition fees .
he also attacked labour 's " systematic culture of spin " and " top-down , centralising control , " which had left so many people " giving up on politics " .
mr cameron said prime minister gordon brown was making things worse .
he said the conservatives would use independent statistics , cap the number of specialist advisers in whitehall and bring about more direct citizenship .

"
the prime minister told labour 's spring conference in birmingham the past few months had not been easy for the party .
but he urged it to work for victory at may 's local elections , as only labour could deliver the change voters wanted .
it was his first speech to the party since his decision not to call a general election in october .
mr brown received a standing ovation from delegates for the speech , which avoided big policy announcements in favour of setting out his vision for the future .
he urged activists to " embrace a new age of ambition " and told them a " britain of security and opportunity for all is within our grasp " .
' realising potential ' he said only labour - and not the conservatives - had the " passion " and commitment to deliver more opportunity . "
imagine if together we create a britain where , for all of us , the future is not a fate we ca n't escape but a common purpose we create " gordon brown labour leader brown steadies ship mend politics - cameron " imagine if together we build a britain where what counts is not how high up you start , but how high you can reach .
" a britain where every parent of every child born today can watch them as they sleep and dare to believe that nothing is beyond them realising their potential .
" and imagine if together we create a britain where , for all of us , the future is not a fate we ca n't escape but a common purpose we create . "
but conservative leader david cameron , in a speech earlier to the welsh tory conference , said people were " fed up with labour " and only the conservatives offered a new agenda .
and he accused mr brown of helping to destroy public faith in politics with labour 's " systematic culture of spin " .
' full employment ' in his birmingham speech , mr brown pledged to rebuild or refurbish more than 320 schools by 2010 , ensuring half of gp surgeries are open for at least one evening or weekend session every week by 2009 and building three million more homes .
he also underlined his commitment to eradicating child poverty , describing it as " the scar that demeans britain " .
and he repeated his pledge that every child should leave school able to read , write and count - with personalised tuition if necessary .
he also defended chancellor alistair darling - who has faced calls for his resignation over his handling of the northern rock nationalisation - hailing the latest figures showing record numbers in employment and saying full employment was " nearly within our grasp " .
he said : " my pledge to the british people is that at all times we will keep inflation and mortgage rates low and ensure stability .
" and with our programme for three million more houses , many of them in eco towns , we will enable thousands more young people to afford to buy a home of their own . "
climate change he also responded to calls from his own backbenchers to legislate for equal rights for agency workers and said labour would honour its 2005 election promise of " stopping good employers being undercut by the bad " .
on the environment he hailed labour 's plans for legally binding emissions targets and pledged to " lead the world by example in triumphing over climate change " .
he also emphasised his commitment to security - although an expected passage confirming the issuing of id cards to foreign nationals next year was not included in the final version of the text .

"
the prime minister told labour 's spring conference in birmingham the past few months had not been easy for the party .
but he urged it to work for victory at may 's local elections , as only labour could deliver the change voters wanted .
it was his first speech to the party since his decision not to call a general election in october .
mr brown received a standing ovation from delegates for the speech , which avoided big policy announcements in favour of setting out his vision for the future .
he urged activists to " embrace a new age of ambition " and told them a " britain of security and opportunity for all is within our grasp " .
' realising potential ' he said only labour - and not the conservatives - had the " passion " and commitment to deliver more opportunity .

but conservative leader david cameron , in a speech earlier to the welsh tory conference , said people were " fed up with labour " and only the conservatives offered a new agenda .
and he accused mr brown of helping to destroy public faith in politics with labour 's " systematic culture of spin " .
' full employment ' in his birmingham speech , mr brown pledged to rebuild or refurbish more than 320 schools by 2010 , ensuring half of gp surgeries are open for at least one evening or weekend session every week by 2009 and building three million more homes .
he also underlined his commitment to eradicating child poverty , describing it as " the scar that demeans britain " .
and he repeated his pledge that every child should leave school able to read , write and count - with personalised tuition if necessary .
he also defended chancellor alistair darling - who has faced calls for his resignation over his handling of the northern rock nationalisation - hailing the latest figures showing record numbers in employment and saying full employment was " nearly within our grasp " .
he said : " my pledge to the british people is that at all times we will keep inflation and mortgage rates low and ensure stability .
" and with our programme for three million more houses , many of them in eco towns , we will enable thousands more young people to afford to buy a home of their own . "
climate change he also responded to calls from his own backbenchers to legislate for equal rights for agency workers and said labour would honour its 2005 election promise of " stopping good employers being undercut by the bad " .
on the environment he hailed labour 's plans for legally binding emissions targets and pledged to " lead the world by example in triumphing over climate change " .
he also emphasised his commitment to security - although an expected passage confirming the issuing of id cards to foreign nationals next year was not included in the final version of the text .

p & o ferries between the kent port and calais are also severely delayed , along with the norfolk line from dover to dunkirk , due to high winds .
it has led to traffic backlogs in kent and the m20 has been closed coastbound to allow lorries to park .
phase two of operation stack is now in place between junctions eight and 12 .
non-freight traffic is being diverted on to the a20 , causing traffic delays and kent police advised drivers to avoid the area where possible .
a spokeswoman said operation stack was expected to be in place for the rest of the weekend , with storm force winds possibly closing the port of dover .
alternative crossings seafrance and p & o both advised customers to check with the ferry companies before travelling .
a spokeswoman for seafrance said it was booking all passengers on to alternative crossings with other operators .
" seafrance is working to end the action as soon as possible and contact between the parties is ongoing , " she said .
" however the union demands amount to the equivalent of an 25 % increase in salary costs over three years , which the company considers excessive and is not in a position to consider . "
eurotunnel advised travellers to allow extra time for journeys to the terminal because of the closure of the m20 .
it said it was experiencing extra traffic because of the ferry disruption and travellers were waiting up to 90 minutes at check-in and 90 minutes in the terminal .
in north kent , the a249 sheppey crossing bridge was also closed because of strong winds , with traffic being diverted via the kingsferry bridge .
